</table><p>With the imminent appointment of a permanent centre manager, and ongoing support from Kidicorp managers, ABC Kelvin Road should be well placed to better promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Kelvin Road in Remuera provides education and care for children from birth to 5 years. Kidicorp took over ownership of ABC Kelvin Road at the end of 2012.</p><p>At the time of the ERO report in 2011 a centre manager had been recently appointed. Since that time the centre has had two further managers and the position is currently vacant. Kidicorp has appointed an acting, part-time centre manager to support staff until a permanent manager is employed. Following a number of staff changes, the teaching team is now stable. The centre will be better positioned to improve practice once a permanent, effective centre manager is employed.</p><p>Kidicorp managers are working with centre personnel to implement Kidicorp’s operational and curriculum expectations. While progress is evident, it is too early for ERO to evaluate the ongoing effectiveness of this support.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers work well together and have worked hard at trying to keep consistent routines for children. They welcome children and their families, and provide good care for children. Teachers are affectionate and promote children's wellbeing. Children appear to be well settled.</p><p>There is a separate space for the care of children who are under the age of two years. These infants and toddlers also have some access to the main learning environment with the older children. The new teaching team now need to review the centre philosophy to develop a shared understanding of effective teaching and learning practices.</p><p>The head teacher is the longest serving staff member and was at the centre at the time of the last ERO review. She is supported by the Kidicorp management team to develop her leadership capability. In her capacity as assistant manager, she has worked to maintain the learning component of the programme during this period of change. Teachers now need to continue to develop and implement a programme that provides increased challenge for children, especially in the outdoors.</p><p>The appointment of a centre manager is an immediate priority for Kidicorp management. A permanent centre manager, together with the staff team, will be able to plan strategically for centre development and the professional growth of teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To promote positive learning outcomes for children teachers need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increase their programme response to identified next steps for each child's learning</p>
</li>
<li>strengthen programme evaluation and assessment of children’s learning</li>
<li>develop bicultural practices that will support the success of Māori children.</li>
<li>Kidicorp managers should further support staff to:</li>
<li>understand and implement more rigorous self review</li>
<li>deepen their reflective practice, including within the performance appraisal process, to promote ongoing improvement to practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Kelvin Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h3>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h3><p>The next ERO review of ABC Kelvin Road will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>21 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
