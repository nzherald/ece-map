</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Dannemora, located in East Tamaki, Auckland, is licensed for a maximum of 105 children including 25 up to the age of two years. Children from three months to five years are catered for in five age-related rooms. This large centre is purpose built and offers all day education and care. Children and staff reflect Dannemora’s multi-cultural community.</p><p>In 2011 the centre changed ownership and now comes under the Kidicorp organisation which provides administrative and professional support. Since the change of ownership, roll and staff numbers have increased. The centre consists of the three previous licences merged into one service.</p><p>The day to day operations of the centre are overseen by the centre manager who is supported by Kidicorp management personnel. The management supports two head teachers as well as the mainly qualified teaching staff and the administrative and support staff.</p><p>The centre philosophy promotes children's growth as confident and competent learners. It emphasises their commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi and to the bi-cultural heritage of New Zealand.</p><p>Since opening in 2008 the centre has had one previous ERO report in 2011. The centre manager responded positively to the recommendations made for ongoing improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and play confidently and cooperatively with others, or independently. They are articulate and teachers focus on building children's vocabulary in the context of their play. Children's literacy and numeracy skills are enhanced through the environment and centre activities. There is clear evidence that the aims of the centre philosophy are reflected throughout all of the rooms.</p><p>Affectionate relationships between adults, babies and toddlers are evident. Children's independence is encouraged and routines are respectful. Teachers are responsive to children's changing needs and preferences. The environments for infants and toddlers are appealing and invite exploration. Teachers place a strong emphasis on supporting young children to explore to try age-appropriate challenges in their play.</p><p>Teachers are committed to ensuring success for Māori children as Māori. Significant progress has been made with increasing staff understanding of Māori language, values, beliefs and history. Teachers have enhanced the centre’s partnership with whānau Māori. Children and teachers are learning to present their mihi.</p><p>Children experience Māori values, as identified in <em>Tātiako - Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners (Ministry of Education 2011).</em> They sing waiata, have opportunities to visit a local marae and learn about taonga from families. Children have opportunities to perform kapa haka.</p><p>Teachers continue to explore ways to support and extend children's dispositions and interests. Assessment records increasingly reflect children's progress over time and are becoming a valuable record of each child’s learning journey.</p><p>The <em>Be School Ready</em> programme is integrated throughout the centre and supports children's transition into and across the centre and to school. Learning experiences that promote relevant early literacy, numeracy and social skills are preparing children to successfully transition to school.</p><p>Teachers participate in relevant professional learning and development (PLD) that aligns to the centre’s philosophy. An outcome of this PLD is the development of stronger relationships between the centre, parents and children. Staff provide opportunities for parents to contribute to the learning programme and to attend parent evenings and events.</p><p>Centre leadership is effective. The manager, with support from Kidicorp personnel, deliberately promotes and supports the leadership of the centre. Staff are offered opportunities to participate in Kidicorp leadership courses. Teachers are collaborative and support each other for the benefit of children’s education and care.</p><p>Self review processes have been improving. Teachers have developed a systematic and useful process to guide the reviews. Teachers reflect on programme planning and assessment and they participate in spontaneous and centre-wide areas for review. Parents, children and staff have input into the reviews and changes are implemented as a result of the outcomes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the centre manager and Kidicorp personnel agree that the key next steps for improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>enhancing the usefulness of self review through developing indicators of good practice</li>
<li>using these indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of curriculum initiatives and outcomes for children</li>
<li>refocusing programme planning from highlighting activities to emphasising individual children’s interests and learning dispositions.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Dannemora completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3><span>Next ERO Review</span></h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Dannemora will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>12 September 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
