</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Patea Kindergarten is situated in a small Taranaki town and is one of 24 kindergartens administered by the newly established Kindergarten Taranaki, formerly The North and South Taranaki Kindergarten Associations. The board is responsible for setting the overall strategic and policy direction for the organisation. Four professional leaders are employed to support learning and development for teachers. The present management structure is under review.</p><p>The kindergarten is licensed for 41 children, over two years of age. Kindergarten Taranaki has a commitment to 100% trained and registered teachers. All teachers at Patea Kindergarten are qualified and registered. Since the June 2012 ERO report, the teaching team has changed with only the head teacher remaining. Staff have worked alongside their professional leaders, to address the areas for review and development identified in the previous ERO report</p><p>The kindergarten’s philosophy that aspires to inclusive practice and a curriculum that stimulates children’s creativity is clearly evident in practice. The establishment of a naturally resourced and peaceful environment is a feature of the kindergarten.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergarten reviews in Kindergarten Taranaki.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enthusiastically engage in a child-initiated curriculum, responsive to their strengths, interests and experiences. They demonstrate confidence and high levels of independence. Literacy and numeracy learning opportunities are integrated and part of children’s choices.</p><p>Learning and development is celebrated through thoughtfully presented profiles. These show the individuality of each child and reflect the complexity of their learning. Parents contribute with stories from home. They share ideas with teachers about their aspirations for their children. These inform planning for individuals and groups. Whānau are welcomed by teachers and their views are valued.</p><p>The integration of a bicultural perspective is strongly evident in all aspects of teaching and learning. Resources and displays enable Māori children to develop a positive understanding of their heritage. Teachers successfully incorporate te reo me ngā tikanga Māori into the programme. They use te reo Māori in their interactions with children and weave waiata and karakia into daily experiences.</p><p>Teachers’ interactions with children are positive and encouraging. Individuals appear relaxed and confident. Teachers engage in interesting learning conversations with children. Teachers recognise and respect children’s different personalities, talents and interests. Indoor and outdoor spaces are suitably conducive to children exploring, developing their physical skills and engaging in imaginative play.</p><p>Children’s sense of belonging and wellbeing is promoted during and after transitions into the centre and when moving on to school.</p><p>Teachers are forming a reflective and collaborative team. Professional learning and development is an important part of the kindergarten’s culture. The head teacher effectively supports the new team. Children’s families are consulted and involved in decision making. Self review has many useful aspects and is leading to improved outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers agree with ERO that:</p><ul>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation of children’s learning should further include parents’ perspectives</li>
<li>planned self review requires further strengthening and refining through continued consultation with whānau and the development of a more evaluative approach.</li>
</ul><h3>Kindergarten Taranaki Key Next Steps</h3><p>Kindergarten Taranaki is a new entity established in March 2014. Collaboratively developed strategies and values guide future direction. An internal review of capacity and capability of non-teaching roles has been completed.  Further development of processes and practices is required.</p><p>ERO, the chief executive and professional leaders agree that priorities for improvement are:</p><ul>
<li>developing the annual plan</li>
<li>strengthening systems and processes for performance management</li>
<li>consistent implementation of appraisal</li>
<li>reviewing and clarifying professional leaders’ role in building teachers’ capability.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Patea Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Patea Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
