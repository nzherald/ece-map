</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Henderson Kindergarten provides education and care for a maximum of 40 children over the age of two years. The Kindergarten day model offers a 6 hour day or a 4 hour morning session. The kindergarten’s philosophy has a strong focus on children learning through play in a rich, meaningful and stimulating environment.</p><p>A new head teacher has been recently appointed to the role. She leads a stable team of three registered, long-serving teachers. A new teacher has recently joined the team.</p><p>The kindergarten community is culturally diverse with the majority of children being of Māori or Asian descent.</p><p>Teachers have responded positively to previous ERO recommendations to enhance bicultural practices and improve opportunities for children’s development of social skills.</p><p>The kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA). The association provides policy, procedural and operating guidelines. It also provides teachers with regular, topical professional development and ongoing support from professional service managers.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten Kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Henderson Kindergarten has a welcoming, positive tone and children are affirmed and supported in their play. Children are articulate and confidently engage in conversations with each other and adults. Parents report that they feel welcomed and are comfortable with contributing to the kindergarten’s programme.</p><p>Children settle quickly and confidently into the kindergarten. The environment is rich and stimulating. There are inviting resources in areas of play and displays are attractive and meaningful for children. Children can freely choose from the wide range of equipment and the many activities offered to support their current interests. Teachers use a variety of successful strategies to encourage children to broaden their learning.</p><p>Teachers are committed to increasing their understanding and knowledge of te reo and tikanga Māori and confidently use te reo Māori during mat times. Teachers are working to encourage more involvement by parents/whānau in the kindergarten. Teachers ensure that children, parents and whānau have opportunities to take part in Pacific celebrations and special events that celebrate tikanga Māori.</p><p>All teachers are committed to further developing their teaching abilities. They have good access to a variety of appropriate professional learning and development that aligns with the kindergarten’s strategic direction.</p><p>Teachers implement effective strategies to support children to transition smoothly from kindergarten to school. Children have many opportunities to develop literacy, numeracy and selfmanaging skills during their play. Teachers also provide parents with useful information about ways to support their child’s transition to school.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to build on current good practices the Professional Services Manager and head teacher agree that teachers should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>integrate te reo and tikanga Māori throughout each session</li>
<li>consider ways to further challenge and deepen children's thinking through play activities</li>
<li>develop a greater focus on children's learning dispositions in planning and assessment records</li>
<li>enhance current self-review processes by evaluating in relation to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and other appropriate indicators of best practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Henderson Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Henderson Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>20 November 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></li>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
