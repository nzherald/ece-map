<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Waiheke Community Childcare Centre is very well placed to continue promoting positive outcomes for children. Curriculum influences and effective teaching approaches support children to become capable and confident learners.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Waiheke Community Childcare Centre provides education and care for children up to five years of age from its premises in Surfdale, beside the Waiheke Free Kindergarten. The two services work together collaboratively to serve children and families in the community.</p><p>The centre consists of two outdoor areas and a large indoor area that has open-plan spaces. Children generally work in mixed-age groups.</p><p>The centre is governed by a committee of parents and wh&#257;nau whose children attend the centre. A senior teacher has responsibility for its daily management and provides the committee with information to help with governance decisions. All of the permanent teaching staff are qualified and long serving. The current leadership and teaching team contributed to a positive ERO report in 2009.</p><p>Since 2009 staff have participated in various professional learning and development (PLD) opportunities. The benefits of this PLD is reflected in improvements made to programme planning, assessment and evaluation practices, and in developments made to provisions for children under two years of age.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are supported very well to extend their own learning and to discover new connections between learning experiences. The language-rich environment helps children to communicate effectively and to demonstrate social competence in a variety of situations. Teachers take time to sit with children and encourage them to solve problems and make decisions that add complexity to their play. Teachers are skilled at listening respectfully to parents and children, and respond agreeably to their wishes.</p><p>Providing equitable opportunities and a sound foundation for successful learning are at the heart of the curriculum. These guiding principles link well to centre practices and to staff professional learning and development. The review of provisions for children up to two years old has led to the redevelopment of the indoor environment and outdoor areas, and an increased emphasis on ageappropriate resources.</p><p>Teachers acknowledge children as unique learners and use a variety of teaching approaches to best serve each child. Some children and staff are speakers of two or more languages. Children with special needs are supported well to participate fully in the centre&rsquo;s programme. The senior teacher&rsquo;s sound knowledge of external support services helps ensure timely support for parents and children. She leads by example and sets high expectations for teachers to support successful outcomes for each child.</p><p>The centre has also established a strong and active relationship with M&#257;ori leaders in the community to strengthen children&rsquo;s, staff and parents&rsquo; understanding of M&#257;ori language and culture. Centre managers could now consider extending these connections to engage more deeply with parents of M&#257;ori children. Information that parents have about their children and their aspirations for them to be successful as M&#257;ori could help staff to increase their understanding of, and support for, children&rsquo;s language, culture and identity. Developing these aspects of centre practice could also ensure greater alignment with the centre&rsquo;s tangata whenua policy.</p><p>The senior teacher and staff ensure that clear connections between governance and centre practices are maintained. A culture of self review promotes a coherence that helps to achieve centre goals and vision. However, the centre&rsquo;s philosophy could better reflect the richness of centre beliefs and practices. A review of this philosophy could be beneficial and have a positive influence on centre strategic planning and future direction setting.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waiheke Community Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>19 December 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
