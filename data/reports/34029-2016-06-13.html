</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Melody Childcare Centre is a community based, not-for-profit early childhood centre governed by a trust board and located in the grounds of the Ruakura Research Centre community. The centre is licensed for up to 60 children, including 18 infants and toddlers up to two years of age. At the time of this ERO review, there were 62 children on the roll, of whom 12 identify as Māori. Children learn and play in three age-related areas.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. Since the 2013 ERO review, outcomes for children have been enhanced by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the introduction of an outdoor education programme to foster children's love of nature and develop resilience and risk taking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>additions to the outdoor play area such as a bike track</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the purchase of a van for excursions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the use of digital learning profiles.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have engaged in a range of professional development focused on further extending their knowledge and teaching skills. Stable staff and management have ensured that the positive practices mentioned in the previous ERO report have been sustained.</p><p>The centre philosophy promotes respect for self, others and the environment. Self review has been strengthened and is being used effectively across the centre to improve outcomes for children.</p><p>Trustees contribute a good range of skills and expertise to the effective governance of the centre. They work collaboratively with the centre manager to ensure financial sustainability and a safe environment for children and staff.</p><p>Parents and whānau are warmly welcomed into the centre and encouraged to participate and be involved in their child's care and education.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from warm, caring relationships with their teachers and each other. They are settled, engaged in play, and confidently initiate conversations with adults and each other.</p><p>Infants and toddlers receive comfort and reassurance from their teachers and settle quickly on arrival. Teachers communicate closely with parents to ensure that there is consistency of care routines, and that parents' aspirations are met. Infants and toddlers have ample opportunity to explore the indoor and outdoor environment and engage in games, actions songs, and a range of creative activities.</p><p>Across the centre, experienced teachers model appropriate language and have conversations with children about their learning activities. They are making efforts to increase their use of te reo Māori. Most teachers were observed working at the children's level, supporting their inclinations, and suggesting further learning opportunities. In the Juniors, children engage in imaginary play and independently access authentic resources and play equipment that extend their thinking and physical skills.</p><p>Children in the Preschool experience a range of learning experiences that promote their inquiry and encourage them to develop their theories and investigations. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>many opportunities to develop literacy and mathematics skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>excursions outside the classroom that foster a love of nature and science</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing use of learning contexts that reflect te ao Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a range of creative activities that involve carpentry, music, art and drama</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>resources and equipment that promote physical challenge, coordination and spatial awareness.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These activities meet the needs of both boys and girls, and prepare children well for their transition to school. The centre works effectively with external organisations to cater for children with diverse learning needs.</p><p>Parents and whānau are encouraged to contribute to the centre curriculum. They read and respond to learning stories that can be accessed electronically. Teachers use these contributions and their observations of children's interests to plan future learning opportunities for individuals and groups. They should now further develop children's ownership of their portfolios by including information about their family, culture and identity and show their learning and progress over time.</p><p>The centre manager provides effective leadership of all centre operations. Head teachers have clear roles and responsibilities that ensure the smooth running of each age-related room. Following centre-wide professional learning and development, (PLD) they have established effective assessment, planning and evaluation processes. Observations of children's learning are transparent and visible on the centre walls and in the learning stories.</p><p>A robust appraisal process is well aligned to Education Council requirements and includes monthly reflections that provide feedback and feed forward. The centre manager has introduced readings to share and critically discuss at staff meetings. Head teachers oversee spontaneous and longer term self review that enhances outcomes for children.</p><p>The board of trustees is committed to the quality care and education of children at the centre. Trustees effectively oversee financial and personnel matters, policy development and review, and property development and maintenance. A comprehensive strategic plan guides the work of the board and management, and an analysis has been done to inform future direction. Trustees have also reviewed their own practice and have ensured succession planning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The 2013 ERO review suggested that the centre increase teachers’ daily use of te reo Māori, introduce local Māori history into the programme, include bicultural perspectives in planning, assessment, and research and embed Māori preferred ways of teaching and learning. While some progress has been made in responding to these suggestions, leaders and teachers should continue to embed Māori perspectives in the philosophy, curriculum, assessment and daily practices.</p><p>ERO recommends that the centre manager and head teachers strengthen their collaborative leadership across the centre. This would assist in the development of shared understandings about current high quality practice in early childhood education, and lead to more collaborative ways of leading the centre.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Melody Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Melody Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>13 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><p>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</p><p>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</p><p>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</p><p>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
