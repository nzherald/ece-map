</table><p>Freemans Bay Playcentre is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.&nbsp;</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Freemans Bay Playcentre is an established parent cooperative that serves a multicultural suburb close to the Auckland city centre. Members provide sessional education and care for children from birth to school age, five days a week in a mixed age group. The centre is licensed to provide for 28 children including up to 15 less than two years of age. Children and their parents/wh&#257;nau are encouraged to attend regularly. As children become more familiar with Playcentre, they are able to attend some sessions without an adult. The parent group takes collective responsibility for independent children.</p><p>The centre follows the Playcentre philosophy, and members have also recorded their own philosophy statement to guide their work with children.</p><p>The centre operates as part of the Auckland Playcentres Association, which provides Playcentre adult education, frameworks of policies and procedures and support from Association personnel. Each Playcentre contributes to the make-up of the Association and has representatives at Association level.</p><p>At present the Playcentre Federation is undertaking a restructure with the aim of maintaining the viability of Playcentres throughout New Zealand. This is likely to change the current structure of the Auckland Playcentres Association.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report identified centre members&rsquo; good practices and provisions in providing programmes for children. The report also identified a growing roll, and the intention of the centre to continue to develop the bicultural content of the programme.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine Playcentre reviews in the Auckland Playcentres Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Freemans Bay Playcentre members continue to provide high quality programmes for children. Centre members work well together, honouring the Playcentre expectation that the centre will operate as a parent cooperative.</p><p>Centre members work well with children, talking to them and developing children&rsquo;s interests and strengths. Children show a real sense of belonging in the centre and ownership of their play. They are enthusiastic about their play. Friendships and tuakana/teina relationships between children are obvious as they happily play alongside and with each other.</p><p>Children are articulate and confident about working with adults and other children. Adults support their conversations, asking questions to prompt children&rsquo;s thinking. They deliberately weave literacy and mathematical concepts into play, to support children&rsquo;s developing understandings.</p><p>Children are provided with a range of high quality resources. As a result of recent review, new furniture, improved lighting and internal repainting have significantly enhanced the learning environment for children. The centre gardens have also been attractively developed. Good supervision on a difficult site increases opportunities for children to explore and learn from a wide variety of activities and experiences as part of their play.</p><p>Centre members have placed significant focus on improving their planning for children. Assessment portfolios include regular observations of children&rsquo;s learning and are used to guide planning for future sessions. Evaluations at the end of each session lead to sound forward thinking about extending children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Centre members continue to develop a bicultural emphasis in the programme. They are increasing their use of te reo and practising appropriate tikanga M&#257;ori. Resources clearly reflect these efforts. Parents/wh&#257;nau also make a special effort to include and value families from diverse cultures. They reflect these cultures in centre displays and resources.</p><p>The Association&rsquo;s strategic plan provides a guide for governance and is regularly monitored. Management and governance processes are well established. The Association provides assistance for centres, and appropriate Playcentre training courses. It provides regular visits every term from a curriculum and programme supporter. Association office holders are highly committed to the Playcentre philosophy and to maintaining Playcentre as a valuable early childhood education option for parents/wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members have identified next key steps include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>develop links between strategic and annual planning to better guide future actions</li>
<li>support members to engage with and complete Playcentre adult education</li>
<li>strengthen bicultural practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Freemans Bay Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Freemans Bay Playcentre will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>25 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
