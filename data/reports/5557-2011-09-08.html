<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Albany Kindergarten is located close to the Massey University Albany Campus. Teachers provide high quality early childhood education for children over two years old. The service operates as part of the Northern Auckland Kindergarten Association, which provides a policy framework and professional guidance for the teachers. An administrator and parent committee also support teachers.</p><p align="left">In 2010 the kindergarten changed operating hours to provide both six-hour and fourhour sessions. This change has resulted in improved teacher to child ratios and has provided scope for the development of more sophisticated play. Despite only a short period together as a team, teachers have established a collaborative approach to teaching. The areas of good performance noted in the 2008 ERO report have been maintained and enhanced.</p><p align="left">Children are confident learners who engage in complex tasks with persistence and enthusiasm. They are articulate communicators who are developing problem-solving and self-help skills that enable them to work effectively in groups and to respond well to adult prompts. Children work cooperatively with their peers, and also enjoy individual exploration in a wide variety of learning areas that integrate literacy, science and creative experiences very well.</p><p align="left">Teachers collaborate to provide meaningful learning experiences that encourage children to investigate, test theories and think creatively. They encourage children to undertake difficult tasks, involving them in rich conversations about their learning and prompting them with open-ended questions and new ideas. Teachers engage in ongoing reflection and respond effectively to children&rsquo;s interests with extended projects. They expect children to use sophisticated equipment and to respect the environment.</p><p align="left">Parents are actively involved in the kindergarten. They participate well in centre activities, support fundraising and share their aspirations for children with teachers. Teachers plan to further enhance relationships with families and to strengthen their partnerships with M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Albany Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Albany Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The kindergarten has experienced significant changes since the 2008 ERO review, including a change in operating hours. The kindergarten now provides six-hour sessions for older children three days a week and four-hour sessions for younger children on the other two days. Changes in staffing include the appointment of a new head teacher in January 2011 and additional teachers. Teachers have focused on developing a collaborative approach to managing the programme and have been refining their planning and assessment practices. They have participated in many professional development opportunities over time and will engage in a shared learning contract later in 2011.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten has recently been relicensed under the 2008 Early Childhood Regulations. While the outdoor environment does not yetfully meet the requirements of the new regulations, plans for the necessary improvements have been prepared and approved by the Association.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Competent children. Children are confident, independent learners. Teachers have high expectations that children will be consistently involved in meaningful play and will undertake challenging tasks. Children engage in play with enthusiasm, accessing resources as required. They are articulate when communicating with others. They enjoy strong social relationships, often working cooperatively with their peers, but many also work individually, particularly as they work skilfully with creative materials and focus on complex activities. Children understand rules well and show respect for the environment. They are learning transferable life skills that enable them to adapt to different play and social situations.</p><p align="left">Skilful teachers. The teaching team works cohesively to provide children with rich learning experiences. Teachers know children well and respond effectively to their individual strengths and interests. They support children to explore resources but also expect that children will be independent learners. Consequently, teachers encourage persistent effort from children and challenge their thinking with open questions, often prompting them to develop imaginative ideas or to test their theories.</p><p align="left">Integrated curriculum. Teachers integrate key curriculum areas effectively into the programme. Extended investigations of interests have provided opportunities for children to explore science, technology and creativity in authentic contexts. Literacy is also a feature of children&rsquo;s learning throughout the kindergarten. Children write for real purposes, using prompts skilfully. They understand that print provides information and supports their learning. Story reading provides opportunities for children to predict, recall and interpret ideas and they frequently use their portfolios and displayed stories to revisit experiences and share their prior learning with others.</p><p align="left">Learning environment. Teachers provide an inviting learning environment that is presented with care and respect. Play areas are arranged to stimulate children&rsquo;s curiosity, prompt discovery and challenge their thinking. Teachers give careful thought to the preparation of resources, making clear the expectation that children are trusted to use sophisticated equipment that supports complex play. Teachers make very good use of natural materials and authentic domestic equipment to reflect the kindergarten&rsquo;s values and a culture of respect for the environment. Attractive displays of children&rsquo;s work, programme planning and learning stories provide high quality information for parents, a sense of celebration for children, and opportunities for them to revisit and extend their learning.</p><p align="left">Self review. Teachers have developed robust self-review processes. They are reflective practitioners who thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of programmes, topics and their teaching strategies. Teachers&rsquo; records of self review reflect their attention to research, consultation and responsive action. Reviews have recently enabled teachers to improve practices related to literacy, biculturalism and the outdoor environment. Currently teachers are reflecting on ways to further develop children&rsquo;s use of ICT to enhance their learning.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Teachers agree that their next priorities for development should include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening documentation in relation to some aspects of programme planning and assessment</li>
<li>enhancing their focus on numeracy in the programme</li>
<li>providing children with further access to ICT</li>
<li>developing strategies to encourage children&rsquo;s individual goal-setting and self assessment.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Five M&#257;ori children are enrolled in Albany Kindergarten. Teachers have a range of knowledge and experience in te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori. They have made bicultural practices a feature of their self-review processes and are improving their use of te reo M&#257;ori in the programme.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Programme content. Learning experiences that reflect M&#257;ori tikanga, values and natural resources are a feature of the programme. Children&rsquo;s M&#257;ori art, work with harakeke (flax) and Matariki activities are celebrated in displays and stories. Taonga, kowhaiwhai patterns and labels in te reo M&#257;ori are used throughout the environment and several resources with M&#257;ori themes provide a strong recognition of M&#257;ori culture. This provision enables M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau to experience a sense of belonging in the kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Involving wh&#257;nau. Parents of M&#257;ori children express appreciation for the learning opportunities the teachers provide. They are made welcome in the centre and are able to contribute to activities that support M&#257;ori culture and values. Recent opportunities for wh&#257;nau to share whakapapa have also improved teachers&rsquo; awareness of families&rsquo; cultural ties and history.</p><h4>Area for development and review</h4><p align="left">Focused goals. Currently, teachers&rsquo; development plans do not include specific goals for enhancing relationships with M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau. Although many good practices have been established, teachers could consider more focused strategies, such as a wh&#257;nau evening, to learn more about family aspirations. Teachers could also make better use of Ka Hikitia, the Ministry of Education&rsquo;s M&#257;ori Education Strategy, as a tool for self-review.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Albany Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-albany-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Albany Kindergarten</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Albany Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Albany Kindergarten is located close to the Massey University Albany Campus. Teachers provide high quality early childhood education for children over two years old. The service operates as part of the Northern Auckland Kindergarten Association, which provides a policy framework and professional guidance for the teachers. An administrator and parent committee also support teachers.</p><p align="left">In 2010 the kindergarten changed operating hours to provide both six-hour and fourhour sessions. This change has resulted in improved teacher to child ratios and has provided scope for the development of more sophisticated play. Despite only a short period together as a team, teachers have established a collaborative approach to teaching. The areas of good performance noted in the 2008 ERO report have been maintained and enhanced.</p><p align="left">Children are confident learners who engage in complex tasks with persistence and enthusiasm. They are articulate communicators who are developing problem-solving and self-help skills that enable them to work effectively in groups and to respond well to adult prompts. Children work cooperatively with their peers, and also enjoy individual exploration in a wide variety of learning areas that integrate literacy, science and creative experiences very well.</p><p align="left">Teachers collaborate to provide meaningful learning experiences that encourage children to investigate, test theories and think creatively. They encourage children to undertake difficult tasks, involving them in rich conversations about their learning and prompting them with open-ended questions and new ideas. Teachers engage in ongoing reflection and respond effectively to children&rsquo;s interests with extended projects. They expect children to use sophisticated equipment and to respect the environment.</p><p align="left">Parents are actively involved in the kindergarten. They participate well in centre activities, support fundraising and share their aspirations for children with teachers. Teachers plan to further enhance relationships with families and to strengthen their partnerships with M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Richard Thornton</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region</p></html>
