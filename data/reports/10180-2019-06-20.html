</table><p>Kia Orana Punanga Reo is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kia Orana Punanga Reo is a well-established service providing bilingual education in te reo Kuki Airani and English language. The service is governed by a Board of Trustees. It is part of the Mangere Pasifika ECE Trust, who are the proprietor of this centre, and four other Pacific early learning services.</p><p>The management committee includes the centre manager, supervisor and curriculum leader. They oversee the operation and administration aspects of the service. There are seven adults who work with children, three registered teachers and four support staff.</p><p>The Christian based bilingual curriculum is guided by <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Rarotongan language, values and beliefs are strongly evident in the centre's philosophy.</p><p>The 2017 ERO report identified concerns related to the quality of management, leadership and teaching practices. Centre leaders have worked with external support and significant progress has been made to address these concerns.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers provide a good quality programme based on a culture of support and respect for children and their whānau. Teachers' positive interactions with children and their 'anau fosters children's confidence and strong sense of belonging. Routines promote children's choice, learning and self-management skills. Teachers show a shared understanding of the centre philosophy, good practices and a commitment to child-led learning.</p><p>Te ao and te reo Māori are valued and promoted in the programme. Children have freedom to explore, have fun and learn in a well organised, stimulating environment that acknowledges children’s Pacific cultural backgrounds. They have many opportunities to learn literacy, mathematics, science and technology skills through play.</p><p>Children's play is well supported through an unhurried pace in the programme. They play cooperatively for sustained periods. The mixed age grouping promotes the whānau concept of playing together. Infants and toddlers have opportunities to explore the indoor and outdoor environments with older children. It is timely now for centre leaders to support adults to provide an individualised learning programme for infants and toddlers based on their strengths, interests and developments.</p><p>Teachers who work with older children listen carefully to them and respond with deep interest. They nurture children's leadership and language skills in their home language and English. Teachers provide affirmation and support for child-led play and children's contributions to the learning plan. Children’s transitions into the centre and on to school are responsive to individual children and whānau needs.</p><p>Children’s individual learning portfolios provide a good record of children's involvement in the programme. Teachers are aware that they could now focus on making children's progress and the continuity of individual learning more visible in the portfolios.</p><p>Teachers’ engagement in professional development has contributed to a collective understanding of assessment and planning. Teachers are reflective, improvement focused and eagerly engage in professional development. Teachers are keen to strengthen their bicultural practices and increase te reo and tikanga Māori in the programme.</p><p>Centre leaders have developed management practices, policies and procedures to inform and guide daily centre operations. Recent professional development has focused on improving the quality of internal evaluation. Leaders have identified internal evaluation as an area to strengthen.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for teachers include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing assessment, planning and evaluation processes to inform curriculum planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extending professional knowledge to further develop quality teaching and learning for children up to the age of two years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving individual children's learning records to show progress and continuity of learning over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Key next steps for managers are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue improving their understanding and use of internal evaluation to guide and improve operational practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen appraisal processes to meet Teaching Council requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop an annual plan that effectively supports the implementation and achievement of strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a succession plan for staff changes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kia Orana Punanga Reo completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice, centre leaders must ensure that they inform parents of any Equity Funding received from the Ministry of Education, and how this has been used to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>20 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
