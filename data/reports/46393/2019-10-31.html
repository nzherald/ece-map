</table><p>BestStart Greenwood Street is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Beststart Greenwood Street is located in Hamilton and is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 80 children up to six years of age. The centre operates three aged-based rooms with separate outdoor spaces for children. At the time of this evaluation review 73 children were enrolled, including 53 who identified as Māori.</p><p>Since ERO's January 2016 evaluation, the centre has changed its name from Community Kindy Greenwood to BestStart Greenwood Street. There have been significant changes in leadership and staff, with the majority having been appointed over the last year. The new teaching team consists of qualified, in-training and unqualified teachers. Teachers' diversity of cultural backgrounds reflects that of children and families in the centre.</p><p>The service is operated by BestStart, a charitable organisation owned by the Wright Family Foundation. Since the last ERO review of this centre a new Chief Executive Officer has been appointed. Regional and local professional service and business managers oversee the Central North Island BestStart centres. Their vision is to work in partnership with families, whānau, teachers and communities to enable children to achieve their learning potential.</p><p>Through the service's vision and philosophy teachers aim to develop relationships based on integrity, respect, nurture and trust. They state that relationships underpin all learning between children, their whānau and teachers under the three Māori principles of aroha, whanaungatanga and wananga.</p><p>Since the previous evaluation, management and teachers have undertaken professional development to further their knowledge of literacy and mathematics in the early childhood setting.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 15 reviews in the BestStart organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from meaningful, positive and responsive relationships with their teachers. Their learning is captured in learning journals which are also available digitally. Respectful practice and understanding of te reo and tikanga Māori nurture the wairua and mana of the children. Children with additional learning needs are fully involved in the learning environment through inclusive teaching practices. Transitions into the centre and between the age-based rooms are well supported. There has been a focus on strengthening social competency strategies. Children develop a sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>A well-designed curriculum promotes positive outcomes for children. Age-appropriate resources in the three learning areas supports children’s interest and learning. Children up to the age of two years benefit from individualised routines and form secure attachments with familiar caring adults. The centre's recently reviewed philosophy is evident in teaching practice. Māori children benefit from the integration of te ao Māori into the programme including the use of te reo Māori, waiata, karakia and whakatau. The programme includes evidence of a multicultural curriculum and resources including Pacific, were observed. Children are engaged and settled in their learning.</p><p>Leaders promote a culture of teaching and learning. Teachers are well supported by the professional service manager, business manager and centre manager. Clear guidelines and expectations inform teaching practice and curriculum delivery. Collegial relationships deliberately focus on developing shared practice in the new team. A culture of critical reflection has been established. Well embedded systems and processes support new teachers throughout their induction procedure. Children are supported to become confident and competent learners.</p><p>Strong systems and processes guide centre operations. Internal evaluation is improvement focussed and includes ongoing consultation with families and whānau. There is clear alignment between the regional strategic direction and centre annual plans. The appraisal process supports teachers to inquire into strengthening their practice, supported by regular and ongoing coaching and mentoring. Several initiatives to remove barriers to education and support wellness for children promotes equity for all learners. The organisation's philosophy, vision and goals promote positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next step for leaders and teachers is to strengthen the assessment, planning and evaluation process. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>capturing individual children’s language, culture and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>exploring culturally responsive teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen the documentation of progression of learning over time in relation to individual children's goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of BestStart Greenwood Street completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice evacuation drills should be organised to test a variety of emergency situation and scenarios. (HS8)</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>31 October 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
