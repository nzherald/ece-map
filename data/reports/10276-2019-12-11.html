</table><p>Mairangi Bay Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mairangi Bay Preschool, formerly Discoverys Learning Centre, offers all day education and care for a maximum of 40 children, including up to 10 children under two years of age.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is guided by <em>Te</em> <em>Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. It identifies a commitment to developing each child's wellbeing and individual needs in an environment where children learn through play and interactions with their peers.</p><p>The owner and acting centre manager are qualified teachers. They are supported by three registered teachers, one unqualified teacher and two relievers.</p><p>ERO's 2016 report recognised a variety of positive features that have been sustained by the new teaching team. It recommended building on te reo me ōna tikanga Māori and bringing children's learning dispositions and skills to the forefront in both planning and assessment. With staff changes and building a new team, these remain areas for the centre to strengthen. Since the 2016 report, learning environments have been upgraded.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and families are warmly welcomed when they arrive at the centre. Children experience respectful relationships that promote a sense of belonging in a home-like environment. Parents who spoke to ERO value positive relationships with staff and the good adult-to-child ratios. Regular centre newsletters and community pages, in English and Mandarin, keep whānau informed of centre activities and upcoming events. Managers continue to explore ways of building educational learning partnerships with parents.</p><p>Children lead their learning, are quick to settle and make independent choices about their play. They play cooperatively with their peers. Older children have easy access to an attractive and spacious outdoor learning environment that is well designed and promotes problem solving and risk-taking in learning.</p><p>Infants and toddlers experience respectful and nurturing interactions with staff. Teachers allow younger children the time and space to learn. Children have easy access to a separate well-resourced outside area for their own exploration and play.</p><p>Teachers provide opportunities for children to be creative and imaginative through open-ended resources. Wall displays acknowledge children's efforts and successes. Children's conversations are encouraged and respected by teachers. Some teachers demonstrate skilful questioning techniques to extend children's thinking skills in meaningful, engaging ways.</p><p>Children are encouraged to sing waiata and participate in karakia and Māori storytelling. Teachers have enrolled in professional development to help them deepen bicultural teaching practices.</p><p>Parents and whānau have access to relevant information about children's participation in centre programmes. Individual learning stories are regular and parent contributions evident. However, there is variable quality in recording children's learning and progress over time. Good practices now need to be consistent across the centre.</p><p>Staff meet regularly to ensure shared understandings of children's interests and to plan activities and resources. Programme planning is based on children's interests across all learning areas<em>.</em> Managers agree teachers now need to strengthen planning to include intentional teaching strategies and add complexity and challenge in children's learning.</p><p>The centre has good processes in place for both spontaneous and planned internal evaluation. It is timely for teachers to deepen their evaluative thinking and to document the impact of changes in practice on learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Strategic and annual planning guides centre operations. The centre is still in the process of rebranding some of its policies and procedures. Streamlining and updating of policies and procedures is supported by an external provider. A well-considered and useful appraisal process has recently been introduced to strengthen teaching practices.</p><p>Building a new cohesive teaching team has been a priority. The acting centre manager is improvement focused. She is working to build a positive centre-wide team culture and create a philosophy to guide and reflect teaching practices. Targeted management and external professional support will support this development and the sustainability of new practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure that the philosophy reflects the centre's vision and future strategic direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment, planning and teaching, so that teachers add complexity and challenge for children's learning across the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adapt internal evaluation practices so that improved outcomes for children are identified</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that policies and procedures that reflect up-to-date requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that managers develop, and provide ERO with, an action plan that shows how the priorities for improvement will be addressed. ERO will request progress updates against the plan.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mairangi Bay Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>11 December 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="[sitetree_link,id=]"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
