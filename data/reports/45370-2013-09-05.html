</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Broadway is a joint partnership between Lollipops Educare Ltd and the licensee and is part of a wider network of similar services. This service commenced operation as two separate centres in 2010 near the central business district of Palmerston North. The two centres merged under a single licence in 2011 to provide education and care for 74 children from birth to five years of age. The centre offers five all-day sessions in purpose built areas designed to suit three different age groups. Twenty percent of the children enrolled identify as Māori.</p><p>The centre director and supervisor work collaboratively to provide effective centre management and professional leadership for 15 staff. They work closely with the national support manager who provides feedback, advice and guidance, particularly on teaching, learning and curriculum. The recently appointed supervisor provides targeted and responsive staff professional support, especially for new and trainee staff and team leaders. The service places emphasis on providing healthy meals for children. This is the centre's first ERO review.</p><p>This is one of two Palmerston North based Lollipops Education and Care centres reviewed at this time.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders show a strong commitment to the centre vision, philosophy and annual priorities. Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging in a culturally inclusive environment. Primary caregivers allow infants and toddlers to gain a sense of security. Self management and independent decision-making are encouraged and evident. Individual children with identified needs are supported through targeted strategies and resources. Children are treated as competent learners.</p><p>Educators actively promote positive behaviours through their calm, caring and respectful interactions with children. The recent focus on emotional learning has raised educator awareness and confidence to assist children to express themselves and interact appropriately. Children are friendly and confident when interacting with adults.</p><p>Children’s sense of belonging and preparation for changes are nurtured effectively through carefully considered transitions into, within and from the centre. Recent reviews have led to improvements and flexibility in transition times. Targeted programmes prepare older children for school according to their needs and readiness.</p><p>Purpose-built and vibrant environments invite children to learn through play. The use of plants and natural materials promotes investigation and reflects values of sustainability. Pictures and photographs displayed at child level encourage revisiting and reinforcement of learning through conversation. Children’s creative work is respectfully displayed and reflects the current programme.</p><p>Curriculum design and planning is room-based, follows a project approach and is closely linked to children’s interests and the principles of<em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Opportunities to develop literacy and numeracy are well-integrated into play. Excursions to the wider community are used responsively to enrich and reinforce children’s interests and learning. Some teachers are still developing their practice and understanding of the notion of child-led play.</p><p>Stories in children’s portfolio books show continuity and demonstrate children’s learning progress in a range of contexts. High quality assessment and evaluation of children’s learning informs parents and teachers of children’s ongoing development and confidence as learners. Portfolios are especially valued by older children.</p><p>A strong commitment to promoting bicultural practices and the principles of <em>Te Tiriti ō Waitangi</em> are evident. Children’s confidence in their own identity and heritage is promoted by daily routines such as shared karakia, waiata and bilingual conversations. The preschool team leader models te reo me ngā tikanga Māori to assist all educators and children become confident learners. Children in the preschool room respond confidently to regular bilingual instruction and conversations. Tuakana teina relationships are apparent as children show care for one another. Māori perspectives are highly visible and embraced in the centre environment.</p><p>Effective leadership and supervision promotes a culture of reflection, inquiry and responsiveness to promote ongoing improvement. Leaders focus on raising the quality of education and care through reviews of programmes and practices for improving outcomes for children. A next step is for centre leaders to model and sustain evaluative self review across the centre.</p><p>A welcoming atmosphere and strong communication strengthens partnership with parents and whānau. Parents have opportunities for useful exchange of information through evaluations of learning and parent/educator interviews. Parents are surveyed for their feedback as part of the centre review and improvement process.</p><p>All educators have access to responsive and targeted professional learning and development. These opportunities are closely aligned to the centre’s vision, philosophy and annual priorities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>A planned appraisal process is in place. This should be strengthened to provide more effective processes for promoting improvement in the capability and performance of individuals against centre expectations.</p><p>The strengthened appraisal process should incorporate the following components:</p><ul>
<li>linking performance from one year to the next</li>
<li>individual goals being more specific and measurable</li>
<li>reflecting and evaluating individual progress against set goals</li>
<li>observations and feedback being consistently documented.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Broadway completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lollipops Educare Broadway will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><p>5 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
