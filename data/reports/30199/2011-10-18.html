<a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p>A Kidz World Homebased Childcare and Education Service maintains networks based in the Bay of Plenty and Auckland. The network is one of two privately owned services that provide education and care for children in educators’ homes. The licensee/owner is the care arranger and employs a coordinator. This network is in Whakatane and caters for 32 children from birth to school age, 13 of whom identify as Māori.</p>
<p>The coordinator and educators plan and document a programme to respond to the care and learning needs of children. Children’s interests and strengths are recognised and responded to in age-appropriate ways. Educators and children are enriching their understanding of New Zealand’s bicultural heritage. Children’s individual cultures are reflected in attractive portfolios that document aspects of their learning.</p>
<p>Children continue to benefit from the positive and affectionate relationships they have with their educators. The recently appointed coordinator provides regular and informed support and guidance for educators. The licensee continues to support the coordinator and educators with resources and professional development opportunities to increase their knowledge, as well as the provision of extra learning opportunities for children.</p>
<p>Since the last ERO review in 2008, good progress has been made in the areas for improvement about personalising children’s learning and strengthening bicultural dimensions.</p>
<p>The licensee, coordinator and ERO agree that the next steps for further development are to continue to strengthen aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation and self review practices to ensure ongoing improvement across service operations and the quality of education and care.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of A Kidz World Homebased Childcare was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atA Kidz World Homebased Childcare .</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO’s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Since the previous review the quality funded, sister network in Whakatane has closed. A new coordinator took up her duties in May 2011 and is dedicated to developing her skills and understanding of an early childhood service in a home-based setting. Recent self review has included updating policies and the operations manual, and a review of appraisal systems. The service endeavours to provide close links to the family and the wider world, where children can become confident and competent learners.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p>Programme: The coordinator and educators plan and document a programme to meet the care and learning needs of children. Children’s interests and strengths are recognised and responded to in age-appropriate ways. Children participate in household routines and make choices about their play and activities alongside other children and the educator. Children are developing their early understanding of literacy and numeracy concepts. Some educators make good use of information and communication technologies (ICT) for research to extend children’s learning, particularly in relation to natural science and the world around them. The programme is enhanced through visits to places of interest in the local community and extended activities such as gym and music classes. Children’s learning is documented in attractive individual profile books that enable them to revisit their learning and share their time in care with other children and adults, including family and whānau. Children are enriching their understanding of New Zealand’s bicultural heritage through a recent marae visit, the use of te reo and tikanga Māori, and access to resources that affirm Māori cultural values. Individual children’s culture is highly evident in their portfolios.</p>
<p>Interactions: Interactions are positive and affectionate. Children are settled in educators’ homes and demonstrate high levels of trust and confidence in their friends and educators. Social skills and independence are carefully fostered by experienced educators through children’s play and sharing in small, whānau groups. There are many examples of tuakana-teina relationships, peer tutoring and turn-taking. Children enjoy learning conversations with their educators that extend their thinking and communication skills. Educators value the regular opportunities to share ideas, receive mentoring, and participate with the coordinator in extending their knowledge of Te Whāriki, The Early Childhood Curriculum. Parents appreciate the positive partnerships they have formed with experienced educators. They are well informed about children’s progress and activities through newsletters, informal conversations, and documentation provided by the service.</p>
<p>Environment: Educators care for children in welcoming and well-prepared homes. Toddlers and young children freely choose from a wide variety of good quality equipment that promotes their early literacy and numeracy knowledge. Indoor and outdoor environments are well presented and provide space for exploring and investigating the natural world. Educators make good use of the local environment for walks and trips with children. The service supports educators in their roles with the provision of extra educational equipment and nursery furniture.</p>
<p>Coordinator: The recently appointed network coordinator has established respectful and responsive relationships with educators, children and the licensee. She is a knowledgeable and experienced ECE practitioner and is developing her understanding of her roles and responsibilities in a home-based early childhood setting. She provides a good model for educators and children in the use of learning conversations and managing children’s behaviour positively. She is confident to use te reo Māori and respectful of tikanga Māori practices. Educators are well supported through her regular visits, modelling of written learning stories about individual children, health and safety checks and provision of resources. Her conversations with educators and documented suggestions support them to continue to develop the quality of learning and care provided for children and their families.</p>
<p>The care arranger: The care arranger maintains positive relationships and professional support for the staff and children in this service. Provision is made for ongoing external learning and development for educators and the coordinator, financial contributions to additional activities for children, and subscriptions to a local toy library. She visits the network regularly and provides readings, workshops and discussions to extend the knowledge of educators in the network. In addition, she employs an administrator to manage enrolments and undertake the administrative duties of the service.</p>
<h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p>Assessment, planning and evaluation: The coordinator and educators need to continue to improve aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation. Areas for consideration include:</p>
<ul><li>maximising the potential of the trained coordinator through strengthening pre and post-visit contact with parents and educators. This is likely to enable the coordinator to identify children’s interests and plan to extend these with resources and activities during her regular visits. It has the potential to further involve family and whānau in the learning process with their children; and</li>
<li>documenting goals and next steps for learning and revisiting these in order to identify children’s progress and development in the profile books.</li>
</ul><p>Self review: The service would benefit from extending self review to support ongoing development and improvement. Aspects requiring attention include:</p>
<ul><li>documenting strategic planning that includes specific goals, dates and persons responsible, and is focused on learning;</li>
<li>implementing a regular policy review cycle;</li>
<li>formalising meeting minutes including the documenting of decision making and following results; and</li>
<li>increasing feedback to the coordinator and educators about their practice.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3>
<p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul><li>transitions ensure the continuing wellbeing, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
</ul><p>Although there are no children with moderate to severe special needs currently enrolled in this service ERO identified features of the service that are inclusive and would be of benefit to them. These include:</p>
<ul><li>an inclusive philosophy which underpins service operations;</li>
<li>experienced educators caring for small numbers of children in home environments;</li>
<li>supportive, inclusive and welcoming interactions across the network; and</li>
<li>adults working alongside children to foster their interests and develop their learning in mixed-age groups.</li>
</ul><p>The service caters for children in the town of Whakatane and makes good use of professional advice available from a range of early childhood providers.</p>

<p>Before the review, the staff of A Kidz World Homebased Childcare completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practice the licensee should ensure that the coordinator responsible for the network is able to respond in a timely manner if an emergency should arise.</p>
<h4>Action Required for Compliance</h4>
<p>During the course of the review ERO identified an area of non-compliance. In order to address this, centre managers must:</p>
<ul><li>ensure all provisionally registered teachers undergo a suitable advice and guidance programme.</li>
</ul><p>[Education Act 1989 s124A]</p>
<a id="5-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Recommendation</h2>
<p>ERO recommends that:</p>

<ul><li>the care arranger/owner access ongoing external professional development and advice to build her understanding and capacity as the professional leader of the service</li>
</ul>
<a id="6-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6. Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>

<p>To the Parents and Community of A Kidz World Homebased Childcare</p>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office’s latest report on A Kidz World Homebased Childcare.</p>
<p>A Kidz World Homebased Childcare and Education Service maintains networks based in the Bay of Plenty and Auckland. The network is one of two privately owned services that provide education and care for children in educators’ homes. The licensee/owner is the care arranger and employs a coordinator. This network is in Whakatane and caters for 32 children from birth to school age, 13 of whom identify as Māori.</p>
<p>The coordinator and educators plan and document a programme to respond to the care and learning needs of children. Children’s interests and strengths are recognised and responded to in age-appropriate ways. Educators and children are enriching their understanding of New Zealand’s bicultural heritage. Children’s individual cultures are reflected in attractive portfolios that document aspects of their learning.</p>
<p>Children continue to benefit from the positive and affectionate relationships they have with their educators. The recently appointed coordinator provides regular and informed support and guidance for educators. The licensee continues to support the coordinator and educators with resources and professional development opportunities to increase their knowledge, as well as the provision of extra learning opportunities for children.</p>
<p>Since the last ERO review in 2008, good progress has been made in the areas for improvement about personalising children’s learning and strengthening bicultural dimensions.</p>
<p>The licensee, coordinator and ERO agree that the next steps for further development are to continue to strengthen aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation and self review practices to ensure ongoing improvement across service operations and the quality of education and care.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre’s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p>ERO’s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<p>Quality of Education – including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Additional Review Priorities – other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p>
<p>National Evaluation Topics – This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p>
<p>Compliance with Legal Requirements – assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
