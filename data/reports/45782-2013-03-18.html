<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Eskdale Treehouse Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Eskdale Treehouse Early Learning Centre was established in September 2011. The licensee has teaching experience and management qualifications, and together with the staff provides high quality care and education services for children from two years of age. Well considered policies and procedures have been implemented and changes in staff during the first year in operation have now settled.</p><p>The centre occupies attractively modified premises in Birkdale, an Auckland residential suburb. The centre is spacious with modern facilities and a large grassed outdoor play area. The programme for children draws on local resources that include nearby parks and reserves. The centre was fully licensed by the Ministry of Education in September 2012. This is the centre&rsquo;s first ERO review report.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p><em>Knowledgeable leadership.</em> The licensee provides professional leadership for the staff. She sets high standards and has clear expectations based on best practice in early childhood care and education. Staff appraisal systems are designed to strengthen teaching capability. Planned weekly meetings with the head teacher ensure that centre operations are regularly discussed and reviewed.</p><p><em>Centre philosophy.</em> The vision and direction for the centre are clearly stated and aligned to <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. Children are viewed as capable and competent learners. Children enjoy the programme and benefit from opportunities to develop confidence and independence.</p><p><em>Reflective practice</em>. Teachers are encouraged to reflect on their practice and to share their learning at fortnightly staff meetings. Centre leaders provide useful readings and questions to guide teachers&rsquo; professional understanding and development. The centre&rsquo;s child-centred philosophy is reinforced through centre leaders&rsquo; continual monitoring and feedback to staff.</p><p><em>Interaction and relationships</em>. Staff relate well with children and with one another. They have established consistent behaviour guidance practices and developed a code of conduct with contributions from children and parents. Routines are respectful of children&rsquo;s preferences and meal times provide good opportunities for children to develop self-management skills.</p><p><em>Environment supports play</em>. Children are able to explore the indoor and outdoor environment freely. Teachers set up centres of interest and display resources so that children can select and create their own activities. Teachers engage children in play, provoke conversation, and encourage positive social interactions.</p><p><em>Relevant programme.</em> Teachers use their knowledge about children&rsquo;s families and the local environment to develop long term project-based programme plans. Currently children are investigating issues of sustainability, including recycling and gardening as a focus for daily activities. The centre is well resourced and children have access to a wide range of high quality equipment.</p><p><em>Creative play.</em> Children have good opportunities for developing their artistic appreciation. Painting, drawing, clay and collage are used effectively to encourage children&rsquo;s creativity. Children&rsquo;s work is displayed and photographed in ways that encourage them to revisit and share their learning.</p><p><em>Centre improvement.</em> Planned and emergent self review is resulting in ongoing centre-wide improvements. Guided by the centre leaders, teachers consider ways of improving outcomes for children. Parent feedback has been useful in identifying areas for review. The recent review of literacy learning has increased the focus and quality of written and verbal language.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The licensee and head teacher agree that priorities for the next stage of centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>using information about children&rsquo;s individual interests and development to better inform teacher planning and to encourage more complexity in children&rsquo;s play</li>
<li>formalising strategic goals that can be used to evaluate and sustain centre progress and improvement, including strategies for increasing bicultural aspects of the programme</li>
<li>ensuring that teacher appraisal procedures incorporate the Registered Teacher Criteria.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Eskdale Treehouse Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>18 March 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ol>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ol><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
