</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Primrose offers full day education and care for children from birth to school age. The centre is purpose built and located in the Hamilton suburb of Frankton. It provides both all-day and sessional service and is licensed for 28 children including up to 12 under two. There are currently 51 children on the centre's roll and 30 are of Māori descent. Families from a range of cultural backgrounds attend the centre.</p><p>The service is owned and operated by the Kidicorp organisation, which provides administrative and professional support. A centre manager supervises and takes responsibility for day-to-day centre operations. She is also responsible for babies and toddlers under two. The head teacher in the over two area has overall responsibility for care routines and programme implementation for young children from two to five years.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review the centre manager has continued to prioritise areas for review and development including building a professional teaching team and embedding te reo and tikanga Māori. Over 80 percent of the staff are qualified early childhood teachers. Overall staffing in the centre has remained stable.</p><p>The concept of ‘whanaungatanga’ (building relationships and bringing the family together) stated in the centre's philosophy, is well embraced and has a significant influence on the centre culture. Teachers demonstrate cultural sensitivity, and work to include all parents and whānau as contributing members of the centre community. Children’s identity is valued. Respectful, trusting relationships are a feature of the centre.</p><p>The centre programme includes growing relationships with the local primary schools to support children’s transition to school. Community members are welcomed into the centre and children enjoy frequent excursions outside the centre.</p><p>This review was part of a group of six education and care service reviews in the Kidicorp (Ltd) umbrella organisation in Hamilton. ABC Primrose has a positive ERO reporting history.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Babies and toddlers receive high-quality care. They enjoy warm, respectful relationships with adults and each other. Teachers are accomplished at supporting and guiding babies and toddlers growing social understandings. Transitions and routines are unhurried and responsive to the needs of babies and toddlers. The tone in this area is calm and settled.</p><p>Babies and toddlers trust their environment and make choices as they explore and make sense of the world around them. They experiment with messy play and a variety of toys and resources. Frequent conversations with parents and whānau provide teachers with vital information about babies and toddlers preferences and needs. Teachers skilfully respond to babies’ early attempts at verbalisation, and use language to soothe and comfort them. They model new words for toddlers and give them time to respond and converse.</p><p>Young children have many opportunities for learning about literacy and numeracy, through play throughout the day. The ready for school programme has identified appropriate skills and ways of learning that children are likely to benefit from as they transition to school. These skills are developed within meaningful and responsive play contexts. Teachers effectively implement inclusive practices that enable young children with special learning needs to participate in the programme.</p><p>Free choice contributes to high levels of confidence and involvement by young children as they play and interact with one another and adults. Teachers deliberately plan programmes based on children’s emerging interests to extend their skills and social development. Young children are encouraged by teachers to explore and think about what they are doing. They enthusiastically join together in groups and spend time on independent play.</p><p>Parents and whānau are valued as equal partners by teachers and have many opportunities to participate with their children in their play. Parent involvement contributed to the success of a ‘Rippa Rugby’ event. This tournament was initiated by the interests of two children and a letter they wrote to the centre manager. The outcome of the tournament was to create links to the wider community and promote children’s interests beyond the centre.</p><p>Programme planning practices focus on children's individual interests and allow teachers to respond to an evolving curriculum. Teachers focus on the way children learn and how it can be extended. They use the programme evaluation process effectively to reflect on the impact of their teaching practices on children's learning.</p><p>Māori tamariki and their whānau hear and see te reo and tikanga Māori in the centre. This acknowledgement of te reo and tikanga Māori contributes to the strong partnership between the centre and whānau. Teachers who are confident, take responsibility for integrating waiata, karakia and te reo Māori into the programme. These good role models and an external provider continue to build the confidence and capability of all staff.</p><p>The professional services manager is focused on promoting effective leadership throughout the centre. She provides high-quality support and guidance for the centre manager and staff. The centre manager is highly skilled, and very dedicated to her role, especially in engagement and support for parents and whānau. She is well supported by staff and promotes a collaborative team approach to leadership, which is soundly based on mutual respect and trust. Teachers are encouraged to manage their own professional learning and development and to reflect on the outcomes of their practice. Robust self-review systems guide all areas of review and development in the centre.</p><p>The Hamilton regional office of Kidicorp Ltd was established in 2012 and provides strong and effective governance, leadership and management support. This includes well-developed and rigorous self review and quality assurance processes, along with professional, administrative and business support by well qualified and experienced personnel.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The Kidicorp organisation and centre manager have plans for redevelopment of the outside area. In addition the rear exit into the outside play area needs to be enlarged to allow young children to move freely between internal and external areas of play.</p><p>Reviewing the purpose of children’s portfolios is likely to assist teachers to effectively recognise how children learn and provide a clearer record of how teachers extend children’s progress over time.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Primrose completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Primrose will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>21 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
