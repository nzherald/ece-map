</table><p>Lollipops Educare Birkenhead requires further development in management and leadership so that teachers are better supported to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Birkenhead operates in a suburban area of the North Shore. The centre provides all day education and care for children up to five years of age. At the time of the 2011 ERO review the centre was operating under two licences. Since then the centre has been relicensed under the 2008 Early Childhood Licensing Criteria for a maximum of 60 children, with 16 up to two years of age.</p><p>Children from a variety of cultural groups attend the centre. Teachers are also representative of a number of cultures.</p><p>Since 2011 there have been staff changes, with some long-serving staff remaining and providing continuity for families.</p><p>The centre groups children according to age, in separate spaces. Young children up to two years of age are well accommodated in the first storey with a practical and useful outdoor space. Children from two years to school age have a large open playroom and a playground that provides opportunities for them to engage in a variety of activities.</p><p>The Lollipops Educare management group continues to provide management support and a framework for the operation of the centre. The centre operates under joint venture partner arrangements and is committed to the ongoing development and improvement of its operations. The findings in this report have been developed with the owner and a management representative from the Lollipops Educare management group.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the centre at the start of their day. Children are relaxed and trusting with teachers and settle quickly in the pre-prepared activity areas. Older children demonstrate well-formed friendships and play imaginative games in groups. The younger children tend to play independently or to stay close to teachers.</p><p>The philosophy for the centre is an aspirational statement that provides worthwhile guidance for teachers about good practice. It is a comprehensive statement that includes reference to <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, Reggio Emilia, which has a focus on promoting environments for learning and respecting children as creative, individual learners, and the Pikler approach to infant and toddler care which emphasises valuing children as capable, developing learners.</p><p>Although the philosophy statement is reviewed regularly, references to the ideas and undertakings outlined in the statement are not strongly evident in teachers' practice.</p><p>Children are articulate and friendly. They engage in lively conversation as they play with others. Infants and toddlers receive respectful and affectionate care from teachers. Their needs are met in timely ways and some resources reflect children’s developmental stages. Teachers often talk and sing to the children.</p><p>A focus in the centre is on more formal approaches to learning. This does not encourage children to take a lead in their own learning through play. Teachers have begun to use self review to evaluate the programme and this practice has the potential to help teachers reflect on and develop more child-centred programmes for children.</p><p>The centre managers have consulted with parents and whānau about their aspirations for their child’s learning. This positive step provides whānau with opportunities to contribute to the programme. Teachers have made special attempts to increase the focus on including te reo Māori in the programme. Children respond appropriately to words and phrases in te reo Māori.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers and ERO agree that the next key steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop and embed an agreed philosophy</li>
<li>provide further training for centre leaders</li>
<li>strengthen self-review processes</li>
<li>further develop shared understanding with parents about the foundational skills for learning to prepare children as life-long learners</li>
<li>place a stronger focus on the multi-cultural identities and backgrounds children bring with them to the centre.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Birkenhead completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance during the review around the programme and leadership within the centre. To meet requirements the service needs to:</p><ul>
<li>ensure that teachers understand the expectations about programmes that provide positive learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>ensure that leaders in the centre have sufficient training to monitor and guide practices that provide well for children’s holistic development through child-centred play and learning</li>
<li>strengthen and deepen the focus of self review to provide guidance for teachers about the quality of programmes for children</li>
<li>continue to build teachers confidence to reflect the importance of children’s own languages, cultures and identities within the learning curriculum.</li>

ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
