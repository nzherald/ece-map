<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Eden/Epsom Playcentre parents/wh&#257;nau work together collaboratively to manage the centre. They provide five sessions per week for up to 30 children from birth to school age. The Auckland Playcentres Association provides a framework for centre operations, personnel to support members, and an adult education programme. The positive features of the centre noted in ERO&rsquo;s 2008 report continue to be evident.</p><p align="left">Centre practices clearly reflect Playcentre philosophy, where adults and children learn together and connections between children&rsquo;s learning at home and in the centre are seamless. The centre has a strong sense of history and community, and an inclusive, welcoming culture. Relationships are caring and respectful. New families are well supported to become active members of the centre community. Children and their families demonstrate a sense of ownership, belonging and wellbeing in the centre. Centre members express a commitment to retaining and building further on the culture and philosophy of the centre.</p><p align="left">Parents/wh&#257;nau have participated in professional development opportunities that have resulted in improved understandings about self review and good quality teaching and learning. As a result, programme planning is now focused on adults&rsquo; shared knowledge about each child. Reflective practice is becoming an integral part of adults&rsquo; day-to-day discussions, and all aspects of centre operations.</p><p align="left">Children choose freely from a wide variety of good quality equipment and creative resources in well presented, inviting play areas. The covered decks and extensive grounds offer diverse opportunities for exploration. Parents/wh&#257;nau provide very good support for child-initiated play. They respond to and build on children&rsquo;s ideas to extend learning. Experienced centre members model interactions that foster children&rsquo;s thinking, reasoning and problem-solving abilities. Effective, integrated support for children&rsquo;s literacy learning is evident. Provision for infants and toddlers is thoughtful and responsive.</p><p align="left">Strategic and annual plans and association review processes are used to monitor progress towards the centre&rsquo;s goals for ongoing development. The centre is well placed to sustain current good practices and continue building capability amongst members.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the members of Eden/Epsom Playcentre were invited to consider their priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the centre members. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atEden/Epsom Playcentre.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The centre currently provides five mixed-age sessions per week. Families involved have good levels of Playcentre training, bring a diverse range of background skills, and contribute in a variety of ways to centre and association operations. Recent turnover in membership has been a result of a large group of children leaving for school. However, continuity in centre operations and support for new families is provided by several long-standing centre members.</p><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s 2008 report recognised ongoing strengths in the centre and suggested that parents/wh&#257;nau consider ways to enhance the challenge and complexity in children&rsquo;s learning. Establishing long-term planning and strengthening self-review practices were key areas for development. Centre members continue to reflect on ways to build further on the good progress made in these areas. The integration of te reo M&#257;ori was identified in 2008 as an area for development and continues to be a focus.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Community culture and philosophy. A feature of the centre is its sense of history, in both the physical setting and in the Playcentre community. Several generations of some families have attended the centre, and members of the wider community contribute to children&rsquo;s learning experiences in a variety of ways. Long-standing, experienced members provide modelling and support for newer members and demonstrate high level facilitation skills.</p><p align="left">Centre members are active learners as parents, and express a commitment to provide high quality learning experiences for their children. Children benefit from the mixed-age sessions where toddlers, older children and adults participate in learning experiences together. Programmes for first-time mothers in the community, and after-school sessions for school children in centre families contribute to an ongoing sense of ownership and belonging amongst children and their families.</p><p align="left">Continuity. The seamlessness between fostering children&rsquo;s learning in the centre, at home, and in the community is strongly evident. Children frequently bring ideas from home to the centre and parents/wh&#257;nau continue to expand on these ideas both during sessions and at home. The recent review of positive guidance for promoting children&rsquo;s social competence illustrates the way that families discuss, develop and implement shared practices.</p><p align="left">Physical environment. The centre&rsquo;s property is extensive. It includes an open grass area and varied spaces that offer physical challenges for all age groups. Children can readily access a wide variety of thoughtfully presented equipment and creative resources to support their learning. Parents/wh&#257;nau frequently review and adapt play areas in response to what they observe about children&rsquo;s emerging interests. Improvements since ERO&rsquo;s 2008 review include covered decking, upgraded kitchen facilities, and new safe-fall material and playground structures. Plans for further development include making use of a mature bush area.</p><p align="left">Support for learning. Children initiate and direct play, use resources flexibly and confidently ask adults for support when needed. Older children work together collaboratively with adults and each other. They also have good opportunities to work independently. Adults encourage inclusive social interaction and foster skills for independent thinking and problem solving. They also use effective strategies for fostering literacy and numeracy as they work alongside children. The curriculum provides a sound foundation for children&rsquo;s ongoing learning.</p><p align="left">Planning, evaluation and assessment. As a result of working with an external adviser, centre members have developed comprehensive practices for assessment, planning and evaluation. Their processes are well documented and continually evolving. Parents/wh&#257;nau have very good shared knowledge of children&rsquo;s learning and development and focus planning and session evaluations on the interests and needs of individual children.</p><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s individual assessment records contain a full record of their learning journey at the centre and the relationships they enjoy there. These portfolios contain multiple adult perspectives as well as children&rsquo;s own contributions, and reflect support for children to grow as independent, competent learners.</p><p align="left">Collaborative management and self review. Centre members have good opportunities to contribute to centre management and self review. Reflective practice and more formal self review are becoming well established aspects of discussions during sessions and at meetings. Centre members discuss strategies for succession and sustainability and a strategic plan guides ongoing development. The centre is very well positioned to sustain and continue building on current good practices that contribute to high quality programmes for children.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Centre members have clearly identified future directions for the centre and areas where they plan to continue improving their practice. ERO supports these goals, which include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening the bicultural nature of the programme through increased integration of te reo me &#333;na tikanga M&#257;ori during sessions</li>
<li>increasing the extent to which families&rsquo; diverse cultures and languages are visible in the environment and included in programmes</li>
<li>continuing to review and refine processes for planning, evaluation and assessment</li>
<li>further increasing members&rsquo; understanding of self review, regularly reviewing key aspects of centre practices, and evaluating outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the members of Eden/Epsom Playcentre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2><p align="left">ERO agrees that centre members should continue to use self review to:</p><ul>
<li>sustain good practices and build members&rsquo; capability</li>
<li>achieve self identified strategic goals</li>
<li>continue refining programme planning, evaluation and assessment practices.</li>

</table><p>26 April 2012</p><p>To the Parents and Community of Eden/Epsom Playcentre</p><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Eden/Epsom Playcentre.</p><p align="left">Eden/Epsom Playcentre parents/wh&#257;nau work together collaboratively to manage the centre. They provide five sessions per week for up to 30 children from birth to school age. The Auckland Playcentres Association provides a framework for centre operations, personnel to support members, and an adult education programme. The positive features of the centre noted in ERO&rsquo;s 2008 report continue to be evident.</p><p align="left">Centre practices clearly reflect Playcentre philosophy, where adults and children learn together and connections between children&rsquo;s learning at home and in the centre are seamless. The centre has a strong sense of history and community, and an inclusive, welcoming culture. Relationships are caring and respectful. New families are well supported to become active members of the centre community. Children and their families demonstrate a sense of ownership, belonging and wellbeing in the centre. Centre members express a commitment to retaining and building further on the culture and philosophy of the centre.</p><p align="left">Parents/wh&#257;nau have participated in professional development opportunities that have resulted in improved understandings about self review and good quality teaching and learning. As a result, programme planning is now focused on adults&rsquo; shared knowledge about each child. Reflective practice is becoming an integral part of adults&rsquo; day-to-day discussions, and all aspects of centre operations.</p><p align="left">Children choose freely from a wide variety of good quality equipment and creative resources in well presented, inviting play areas. The covered decks and extensive grounds offer diverse opportunities for exploration. Parents/wh&#257;nau provide very good support for child-initiated play. They respond to and build on children&rsquo;s ideas to extend learning. Experienced centre members model interactions that foster children&rsquo;s thinking, reasoning and problem-solving abilities. Effective, integrated support for children&rsquo;s literacy learning is evident. Provision for infants and toddlers is thoughtful and responsive.</p><p align="left">Strategic and annual plans and association review processes are used to monitor progress towards the centre&rsquo;s goals for ongoing development. The centre is well placed to sustain current good practices and continue building capability amongst members.</p><h3>Futre Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
