</table><p>Reid Park Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Reid Park Kindergarten provides early childhood education for children aged two years old to school age. It is licensed for 45 children and currently has a roll of 51. Nine children identify as Māori and five as from other ethnic groups. Sessions operate from 8.30am to 2.30pm.</p><p>Teachers aim to support children to develop early literacy and numeracy, social and emotional competency, be active explorers, be creative and independent, and have respect for <span lang="mi">Papatuanuku</span>. They seek to achieve this through partnerships with families, valuing children's voice and culture, celebrating diversity, and fostering children's sense of belonging in respectful and inclusive ways.</p><p>The teaching team has made good progress in addressing the areas for development identified in the kindergarten's November 2015 ERO report. These included improving aspects of planning, assessment and evaluation for individuals and group learning.</p><p>Reid Park Kindergarten is one of 24 kindergartens governed by Dunedin Kindergartens (DK). Day-to-day operations are led by a head teacher, with the support of three experienced, qualified teachers and a teacher aide. A senior teacher from DK provides support for professional and operational practice.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven DK kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's learning benefits from an environment that is calm and welcoming. Relationships are inclusive, respectful and guided by <span lang="mi">manaakitanga</span>. Children play well alongside and with each other. Teachers know each child very well and work closely with parents to best meet their learning needs. Māori and other cultures are valued in the curriculum and highly visible in the environment.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor environment is beautifully resourced and presented to engage and provoke learning. The spaces, resources and equipment provide a range of rich opportunities for play and exploration, and strongly support the physical and social developmental needs of the different groups of children.</p><p>Children experience a broad and interesting curriculum that supports the kindergarten's priorities for learning. Teachers deliberately provide experiences to foster children's social competency, early literacy and mathematics, and their fine and gross motor skills. They prioritise <span lang="mi">te reo me ngā tikanga Māori</span>, including local cultural narratives.</p><p>Priority learners are very well supported. Teachers plan carefully in order to best meet the needs and interests of two year olds. They work closely with parents and external experts to best support children with additional needs. Māori children's culture and language are affirmed, enabling them to stand proud in their culture.</p><p>Teachers have developed effective assessment, planning and evaluation processes. Children's profiles include relevant learning goals, unpack significant learning and show progress over time. These value children's language, culture and identity. Group planning is based on <em><span lang="mi">Te Whāriki</span>,</em> has clear learning outcomes and results in well-considered resourcing and experiences. Teachers and ERO agree that teachers need to better document their discussions about children's goals and relevant teaching strategies. Parents' contributions could be more visible in learning records.</p><p>Teachers are reflective and improvement focused. Strategic priorities and plans are based on what matters most for children. There is strong alignment from these to professional learning. Internal evaluation has resulted in research-informed improvements to teaching and outcomes for children. Teachers and ERO agree that aspects of internal evaluation could be strengthened.</p><p>The DK board has made good progress in addressing the governance recommendations from ERO's 2016 reviews. The DK's mission and strategic priorities are well known and reflected in each kindergarten's strategic and annual plans. It has a sound policy and procedure framework that provides guidance for kindergartens and sound systems to monitor health and safety. Leaders and teachers benefit from relevant professional development and leadership support. The DK actively supports equity of outcomes for all children by funding additional teaching resources to support children with additional needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that to further improve outcomes for children they need to:</p><ul>
<li>deepen aspects of the evaluation process for planned evaluations</li>
<li>ensure regular and documented team discussions about individual children's goals and planned teaching strategies are in place</li>
<li>make parents' contributions to children's learning more visible in learning records.</li>
</ul><p>The DK board has clearly identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps for DK to further improve outcomes for children are to ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>reporting and monitoring at all levels are evaluative, to clearly show how desired outcomes for children have been improved in relation to the DK and kindergartens’ priorities for learning and other strategic priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a robust and systematic quality assurance framework is implemented to inform and monitor ongoing improvements in each kindergarten.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Reid Park Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Southern)</p><p>Southern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Tini</span></p><p>22 May 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
