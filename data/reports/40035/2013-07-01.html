</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Matua Plunket Kindergarten is a community-based service, located in the Matua suburb of Tauranga. It caters for children from two years to school age in a mixed-age setting. Both full day and sessional options are available during school terms. The service is owned by and operates under the governance of the Royal New Zealand Plunket Society.</p><p>In 2011 significant changes to administration, staff roles and responsibilities and financial constraints have occurred. These have impacted on centre management, organisation and hours of operation. resulting in strengthened viability of the service, greater flexibility for families and clarity of leadership roles and responsibilities.</p><p>Since ERO’s last review in 2010 the centre has maintained its commitment to employing 100% qualified staff. Many staff members have been at the centre for a significant number of years. The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre manager has been well supported by Plunket to restructure and reorganise the centre. A suitable range of policies effectively guide centre operations and prudent financial management has enhanced viability of the service. Families appreciate the centre’s responsiveness to their needs.</p><p>The centre philosophy has been reviewed to make priorities and teaching approaches clear and better understood by both teachers and parents. Professional development has been valuable in assisting the management and teaching team to recognise leadership styles of themselves and others. They maximise opportunities for all staff to make a contribution and lead curriculum developments. Parents are actively encouraged to be involved and to show leadership in aspects of the programme and centre operations. This shared leadership and contribution enriches learning opportunities for children.</p><p>Aspects of the curriculum and teaching practice that are highly evident include:</p><ul>
<li>promotion of virtues related to character and life skills which support children as capable and confident learners</li>
<li>responding to children’s strengths and interests in a well-resourced, play-based setting</li>
<li>respectful and reciprocal relationships among teachers, children and families</li>
<li>the provision of literacy, mathematics and technology in context for children and meaningful learning conversations</li>
<li>teachers listening and responding to children using an effective range of strategies</li>
<li>children showing leadership in play scenarios, planning and learning in an atmosphere of enjoyment, purpose and fun.</li>
</ul><p>Additional special features of the curriculum are the genuine inclusion of children with diverse learning needs and parent education opportunities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre management agree on these priority areas to enhance centre development:</p><ul>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation processes so that teachers reach a common understanding about the purpose and use of assessment information. They also need to develop consistent quality practices that clearly document progress and learning for individual children</li>
<li>treaty-based practices to more closely reflect the centre philosophy’s acknowledgement of Te Tiriti o Waitangi</li>
<li>develop and implement an effective and ongoing appraisal process that is linked to professional development and is supportive, rigorous and culturally appropriate.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Matua Plunket Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Matua Plunket Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>1 July 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
