</table><p>Kauri Kids Takapuna is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kauri Kids Takapuna is located in the Takapuna Leisure Centre. It is licensed for 30 children, including up to 10 under the age of two years. The facility offers a variety of full-day, session and casual attendance options. It provides for mixed-age play and has a separate area for infants and toddlers. The head teacher leads a mostly qualified staff team.</p><p>Kauri Kids Takapuna is one of 11 early childhood education (ECE) centres across the wider Auckland region managed centrally by Auckland Council. Kauri Kids Auckland Council Management (KKACM), provides a governance and management framework, and support personnel to assist the centre. An ECE curriculum leader is responsible for the overall operation of the Kauri Kids services. The head teacher in each service reports to the manager of the facility where the service is based.</p><p>The principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, are reflected in the centre programme. The recently reviewed philosophy of all Kauri Kids centres emphasises the organisation's commitment to providing a service that values quality learning experiences and opportunities for exploration, the inclusion of all children and their families, and the bicultural nature of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>Leaders continue to strengthen the good practices noted in ERO's 2015 report, along with bicultural practices and partnerships with parents.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three services reviews in the Auckland City Kauri Kids organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are social, confident and highly engaged learners. They lead the direction of their learning and choose play areas based on their interests. They have strong, trusting connections with their teachers, who talk with them in meaningful ways. A strong sense of respect and belonging is evident in the centre. Children have plentiful opportunities for uninterrupted, inclusive and friendly play. Routines are unhurried and the centre is very calm.</p><p>Children under the age of two benefit from responsive, caring interactions with their teachers. They enjoy mixed-age play opportunities and confidently move around the centre. Teachers skilfully nurture children's independence and self-help skills.</p><p>The experienced teachers work collaboratively, and provide a welcoming and attractive environment for families. Relationships with parents and whānau are well established. Transitions into and through the centre are child focused and tailored to suit families.</p><p>Thoughtful presentation of the environment fosters children's creativity and imaginative play. There is a wide variety of natural resources that are easily accessible by children. After significant refurbishment and redesign, the outdoor environment offers good provision for creative and imaginative exploration, and promotes physical play. Regular access to leisure centre facilities provides extra opportunities for physical activity.</p><p>Teachers implement a child focused, play-based programme. Assessment and planning are responsive to children's interests. Assessment portfolios provide very good information about learning experiences, and these are shared with parents electronically. Informal discussions and informative wall displays also keep parents well informed. Teachers build children's capability to transition to school by promoting opportunities through the programme.</p><p>Centre routines acknowledge the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. Te reo and tikanga Māori are integrated in the programme. Professional development has built teachers' capability and confidence. Children's cultural backgrounds are acknowledged and respected.</p><p>The leadership team has a strong focus on continual development. Leaders support team members to develop their leadership capability. Teacher appraisals are aligned with the centre's strategic goals and required teaching standards. Teachers' professional learning is impacting positively on outcomes for children.</p><p>Well-developed strategic plans and annual plans guide centre operations. Health and safety, and employment policies align with Auckland Council expectations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to review how effectively teachers identify their role in children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making children's cultural identities more visible in the learning programme and documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building bicultural practice by developing a local curriculum that explores the history of the immediate area.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The KKACM operations manager and centre leaders agree that, across the organisation, they should continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>bicultural practice in all centres</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal systems, to meet Teaching Council requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation through more evaluative questioning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment, programme planning and evaluation practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kauri Kids Takapuna completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>21 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
