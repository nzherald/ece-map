<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Berhampore Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">Berhampore Kindergarten is located in a southern suburb of Wellington. Children come from a wide range of backgrounds and for many, English is a second language.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten tone is respectful and inclusive. Teachers are friendly and welcome children and their parents warmly. Parents are encouraged to participate in kindergarten life. A family like atmosphere is fostered.</p><p align="left">The curriculum provides opportunities for children to explore a range of learning areas. Teachers work at children&rsquo;s level, provide stimulating activities and encourage children to explore. Where children have free choice of learning experiences and materials, sustained play and high levels of engagement are evident.</p><p align="left">Some effective practices are in place to support children develop early literacy skills and understanding in the context of their play or activities. Stories are regularly shared and the lending library gives parents access to a wide range of suitable books.</p><p align="left">The environment is spacious and well resourced. The garden has a distinctive New Zealand flavour, is aesthetically pleasing and promotes children&rsquo;s understanding about healthy food and sustainable practices.</p><p align="left">Teachers are in the early stages of developing a team approach. They acknowledge that priorities for review and development include implementing effective self review, achieving consistency in positive guidance strategies and strengthening assessment for programme planning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Berhampore Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atBerhampore Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">the programme provided for children;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">the learning environment; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">the interactions between children and adults.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Since the April 2008 ERO review, the kindergarten has restructured, increased session hours and expanded the teaching team. This has improved the teacher/child ratios. The teaching team comprises of a new head teacher, appointed in February 2011, and four teachers, one of whom is provisionally registered. Two teachers are new to the kindergarten this year.</p><p align="left">Environment upgrades include improved kitchen and bathroom areas and provision of veranda coverings for winter play. Development of the outdoor area is a future priority.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p align="left">Families&rsquo; multicultural backgrounds are acknowledged and respected. Children&rsquo;s diverse needs are recognised. Artefacts are brought in by families and prominently displayed to reflect cultural identities. Teachers use home languages in greetings at kotahitanga times to encourage a family like atmosphere. Parents&rsquo; expertise in their language is used effectively for translation.</p><p align="left">The tone is inclusive. Teachers are friendly and welcome children and their wh&#257;nau warmly. This has been a key focus, particularly for families with non-English language backgrounds. Staff are continuing to develop processes to encourage parents to visit and children to familiarise themselves with the environment. Parents are invited to informally discuss their child&rsquo;s learning and well-being and participate in kindergarten life.</p><p align="left">The curriculum is broad and provides opportunities for children to experience the different learning areas. A range of mathematics resources is available. Children explore science concepts and apply them to practical activities. Some good teaching strategies are used, including working at children&rsquo;s level to sustain interest, providing stimulating activities and encouraging children to explore them. Where children have free choice of materials and learning experiences, sustained play and high levels of engagement are evident.</p><p align="left">Development of early literacy skills and understanding is appropriately supported. Opportunities are provided within the context of play and activities children are undertaking. Stories are regularly shared and the lending library gives parents access to a range of suitable books. Teachers are developing information and communication technologies to support learning.</p><p align="left">There is a clear commitment to increasing children&rsquo;s awareness of biculturalism. Gathering times reflect some aspects of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori and teachers are beginning to integrate basic te reo M&#257;ori naturally into conversations.</p><p align="left">Teachers continue to review their approach to assessment, planning and evaluation. Some good quality assessment records provide well developed accounts of children&rsquo;s significant interests, analysis of learning and suggestions for next steps in learning. Multiple teachers&rsquo; voices are evident in individual records and attention is being paid to further developing a bicultural perspective.</p><p align="left">The environment is spacious and well resourced. The garden has a distinctive New Zealand flavour, is aesthetically pleasing and promotes children&rsquo;s understanding about healthy food and sustainable practice. The outdoor area provides suitable development of motor skills and physical challenge and opportunities for construction and messy play.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p align="left">Teachers are in the early stages of developing their team approach. Teachers agree that the following aspects of practice need development. In particular:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">self review, while valued as a tool to promote improvement, is not yet well implemented. Strengthening the reference to quality indicators and a wider collection of evidence is likely to enhance the process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">consistency in positive guidance of children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">at times the programme is overly teacher-directed. There is a need to ensure activities are presented in response to children&rsquo;s interests or ideas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">the bicultural perspective in the programme, including strengthening the integration of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">teachers identify they need consistency in their recording of children&rsquo;s learning in portfolios, to increase parents&rsquo; input into learning records and make planning more responsive to this information. In addition, more of a focus on linking learning stories and illustrating the strategies teachers are using to promote learning should enhance their approach</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">planning for group programmes needs to be more responsive to children&rsquo;s emerging interests and ideas and their next learning steps.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-association-support" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">3 Association Support</h2><h4 align="left">Background</h4><p align="left">The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p align="left">Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p align="left">The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p align="left">The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">the strategic plan, setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">a wide range of professional development opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p align="left">The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice as a result of feedback.</p>
</li>
<li>

This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of Children with Moderate to Severe Special Needs</h3><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions promote the continuing well-being, learning and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>these children are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service demonstrates inclusion.</li>
</ul><p align="left">There are currently a number of children attending the kindergarten who have been identified as having moderate to severe special needs.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p align="left">Teachers are positive and inclusive in their interactions with children identified with moderate to severe special needs, and those supporting their care. Transitions into the centre are well considered and flexible to meet each child&rsquo;s unique needs. Families, education support workers and agency staff, all of whom may also be part of the transition process, are welcome to attend at any time. Teachers regularly discuss these children to ensure goals and strategies outlined in individual education plans are understood and progress is monitored. The head teacher works closely with parents and external agency personnel to discuss goals, progress and ensure continuity of practice between home and the centre.</p><h3>Area for development and review</h3><p align="left">Staff have identified that they plan to enhance their support for children with moderate to severe special needs by spending more time working with them.</p><a id="5-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Berhampore Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist.

</table><a id="parents-and-community-of-berhampore-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Parents and Community of Berhampore Kindergarten</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Berhampore Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Berhampore Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">Berhampore Kindergarten is located in a southern suburb of Wellington. Children come from a wide range of backgrounds and for many, English is a second language.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten tone is respectful and inclusive. Teachers are friendly and welcome children and their parents warmly. Parents are encouraged to participate in kindergarten life. A family like atmosphere is fostered.</p><p align="left">The curriculum provides opportunities for children to explore a range of learning areas. Teachers work at children&rsquo;s level, provide stimulating activities and encourage children to explore. Where children have free choice of learning experiences and materials, sustained play and high levels of engagement are evident.</p><p align="left">Some effective practices are in place to support children develop early literacy skills and understanding in the context of their play or activities. Stories are regularly shared and the lending library gives parents access to a wide range of suitable books.</p><p align="left">The environment is spacious and well resourced. The garden has a distinctive New Zealand flavour, is aesthetically pleasing and promotes children&rsquo;s understanding about healthy food and sustainable practices.</p><p align="left">Teachers are in the early stages of developing a team approach. They acknowledge that priorities for review and development include implementing effective self review, achieving consistency in positive guidance strategies and strengthening assessment for programme planning.</p></html>
