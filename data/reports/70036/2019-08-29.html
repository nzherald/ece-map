</table><p>Clarkville Playcentre requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Clarkville Playcentre operates as a parent cooperative under the governance and management of the Playcentre Federation, Upper South Island Region. This centre is licensed for up to 25 children, including 10 children under two. The centre is open four mornings a week. The centre has a large outdoor area.</p><p>The playcentre employs a coordinator. Parents are rostered to help at each session. The Upper South Island Region employs a centre support person and an administrator who regularly visit the playcentre to support the parents and coordinator.</p><p>The centre's philosophy emphasises children and parents learning together and children becoming competent and confident learners and communicators. The 2016 philosophy also states that the centre will provide a safe and stimulating environment.</p><p>The centre coordinator has been employed at the centre for a number of years. Roll numbers are increasing. Nearly all children attend the playcentre one day a week and also attend other centres.</p><p>The playcentre has made limited progress to meet the recommendations in the 2014 ERO review. The only recommendation in the 2014 report met is to fill all office bearer positions. The recommendations that have not been met include, improving the quality of adult to child interactions, bicultural understanding and practices, internal evaluation and operating effectively as a parent cooperative.</p><p>In this review, ERO also identified a number of health and safety concerns. Assessment, planning and evaluation have also been identified as areas for improvement.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight Playcentre reviews in the Playcentre Federation, Upper South Island Region.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children confidently select from a wide range of well-presented activities and resources in the indoor and outdoor areas. Adults place a strong emphasis on providing a natural environment and excursions into the wider community.</p><p>The Upper South Island Region has recently become more involved in the centre. Parents have begun to participate in the parent education programme. An internal evaluation workshop is helping adults begin to understand internal evaluation and its value in improving the quality of learning for children and adults.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation is variable and depends on the parent's understanding and commitment to the process. Parents are invited to set goals for their children but there is little planning or useful monitoring of children's progress. The children's learning and the ways adults support learning are not well documented or clearly evident in the programme. Assessment, planning and evaluation processes and practices are not aligned sufficiently to Te Whāriki 2017.</p><p>The parent cooperative has yet to develop ways to regularly include and progress te reo and tikanga Māori in the programme.</p><p>Operational systems and practices to support the ongoing operation and improvement of the parent cooperative are either incomplete, new, or not well implemented. The centre now needs to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>focus the roles and responsibilities of the coordinator and parents more explicitly on children's learning and wellbeing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a process to implement, monitor and report against the centre's 2019 strategic plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>create a 2019 appraisal agreement for the coordinator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review and revise the centre's 2016 philosophy to ensure it reflects the centre operations and programme in 2019.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The playcentre does not have robust systems and practices for children's health and safety. These include the supervision of children, maintaining sleep records and excursions from the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The Upper South Island Region, the playcentre and ERO agree that the conditions to support outcomes for children must improve. For this to occur the Upper South Island Region must provide more regular and ongoing support to increase the adult's knowledge and commitment so they can:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>operate as an effective parent cooperative</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make better use of the strategic plan, internal evaluation, the coordinators appraisal and the parent education programme to improve the quality of children's learning and wellbeing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a deeper understanding and knowledge of Te Whāriki 2017 to improve assessment planning and programme evaluation processes and practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>integrate te ao Māori into all aspects of centre life and documents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure the coordinator participates in regular appraisal.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Upper South Island Regional Governance</h3><p>There continues to be significant change occurring with the playcentre's governance and management at regional and federation levels.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Clarkville Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to health and safety, and governance and management. To meet requirements the centre needs to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure supervision of children in the indoor and outdoor areas, particularly the tennis court where children always need direct adult supervision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maintain records of the time each child sleeps and when checks are made by adults</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure parents give prior written permission for their child's participation in excursions as well as the proposed adult to child ratio</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maintain an ongoing programme of internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>undertake regular appraisal of the coordinator.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, - Reg 46; HS9; HS 17; GMA7, CMA6</em></p><h3>Recommendations to improve practice</h3><p>To improve practice the centre needs to:</p><ul>
<li>provide a safe, comfortable space for infants not walking to lie, roll and be protected from mobile children</li>
<li>extend the risk management for excursions to include the steps to be taken to manage potential risks.</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>29 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
