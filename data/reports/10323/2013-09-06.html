</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids Express is a privately owned kindergarten located between Ranui and Swanson in West Auckland. The service caters for children from two to five years of age and offers both all day and sessional care and education.</p><p>Two experienced co-owners, one of whom is a fully trained and qualified early childhood teacher, form the management team. They work closely with the other teachers, who are fully qualified and several are also long-serving staff members.</p><p>The centre has children from a diverse community and wide geographical area. Centre owners and teachers have maintained their strong commitment to cater for children with additional needs.</p><p>The centre has a very positive ERO reporting history and has sustained many of the areas of strength noted in previous reports. Centre leaders have responded well to external review to implement a new performance management system and improved review systems.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s wellbeing is well supported by positive, caring teachers. Respectful relationships between children, teachers, parents and whānau contribute to a settled and calm atmosphere. Effective routines at the beginning of sessions create a sense of belonging between families and the centre.</p><p>Children benefit from a spacious, well designed learning environment. They have very good access to a wide range of learning materials. The programme promotes many opportunities for children to develop early literacy, science and numeracy skills in meaningful ways.</p><p>Children develop as capable and confident learners, making decisions about their learning for parts of the programme. Opportunities for collaborative learning are evident. Time for this could now be extended to encourage more sustained, complex play.</p><p>Māori children are supported by teachers who are developing their use of te reo Māori in the programme. Teachers know these children well and provide opportunities for them to explore their culture and identity in the programme. Finding ways for all teachers to extend their understanding of te reo Māori, te ao Māori and tikanga could enhance outcomes for all learners.</p><p>Teachers recognise the diverse backgrounds of children. Assessment records show some opportunities for children to share their culture and identity. Cultural artefacts are valued by the centre and teachers are continuing to make connections to a wider range of cultural contexts in the programme. To further support Pacific children, centre staff could consider ways to learn and promote the languages of the Pacific, as part of their commitment to inclusive practices.</p><p>Children with additional needs are very well supported. Leaders are committed to providing access to education and high quality support for these children. Trusting partnerships with families are evident, and teachers are engaged in ongoing professional development to ensure they have the skills to best support learners.</p><p>Consistently high quality assessment practices are used by teachers to document children's learning and development. They evaluate children’s learning skilfully and are well positioned to encourage children to evaluate their own learning in greater depth.</p><p>Communication with families is frequent and open. Families appreciate the centre’s proactive approach to supporting their children, especially during transitions to the centre, to school and through any difficult times. Further opportunities for parent education could enhance parents’ understanding of high quality early childhood education and be of use in children’s home settings.</p><p>Centre leaders continue to provide very good professional learning and development opportunities for teachers. Links with external providers are well used to inform centre development and to sustain improvements. A new centre philosophy is undergoing consultation with families, and a new performance management process, with closer links to centre strategic goals, is now in place.</p><p>The centre is well led and effectively managed. Leaders are consultative and collaborative which encourages effective teamwork. There is a focus on continual improvement and evidence of high quality self -review systems.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, centre leaders and teachers agree that the key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>refining the strategic plan to more explicitly focus on positive outcomes for children and to include measurable indicators to report on progress made towards achieving strategic goals</li>
<li>embedding the new performance management approach and linking it with effective teaching practices and the new philosophy</li>
<li>reviewing the structure of the daily programme to increase opportunities for children to engage in sustained, complex learning to further develop their self management skills.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids Express completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids Express will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>6 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
