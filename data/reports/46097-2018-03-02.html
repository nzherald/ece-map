</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Scribbles Early Education Centre is located in Mt Wellington, Auckland. It operates in a large purpose-built facility and serves a culturally diverse community. Licensed for 110 children including up to 35 children under two years of age, the centre caters for children in four age-related rooms. It is one of several services under the same ownership.</p><p>The service's vision is 'for children to encompass and develop a love of life, showing compassion and empathy in all relationships, being inclusive, kind, respectful, non-judgemental and proud of who and where they come from'. This vision and the service's overarching philosophy are influenced by <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and underpin all aspects of the operation of the service.</p><p>Since the 2014 ERO review, there has been significant turnover of staff due to maternity leave. Managers are thoughtfully implementing strategies to ensure that there is a smooth transition of qualified and non-qualified teachers. This is helping to maintain good quality care and education for all children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children, parents and whānau are warmly welcomed into the centre. Teachers know the community well and are responsive to parents' aspirations for their children.</p><p>Teacher practice supports children to settle well in their surroundings. Children confidently explore and make decisions about their play. The indoor and outdoor environments are inviting and well resourced. As a result children readily engage in sustained, collaborative and individual play. Teaching strategies support children to form trusting relationships with adults and to display a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing.</p><p>Babies and toddlers experience calm, nurturing and respectful practices. The teaching team supports children to explore and be curious about their surroundings. Teachers' practice reflects a commitment to the notions of 'an education of care' and 'primary caregiving'. They are responsive and sensitive to the needs of children. A new separate area for children who are not yet independently mobile, provides a secure space for the youngest children to play and not be disrupted.</p><p>Older children mange themselves competently and display a strong sense of confidence. They are respectful of their peers and contribute in a variety of ways to the learning programme. Centre leaders and teachers ask children about their preferences to inform and shape the programme. Teachers agree that it is important to continue strengthening this practice.</p><p>Teachers work as a collegial team, and make good use of the ethnic diversity, skills and expertise that each bring to the programme. They are culturally responsive to children and families, and place importance on Māori as tangata whenua. The varied Pacific heritages of children are valued and celebrated within the programme.</p><p>Transitions into and through the centre are well managed. Centre managers have identified the need for a coordinator to further develop relationships with local schools. The aim of this is to support children's transitions beyond the centre and on to school. Children with additional learning needs are well supported. ERO notes that it would be useful for teachers to revisit planning documentation to strengthen the individualised support for these children.</p><p>Centre portfolios are a record of children's participation in the programme. Learning Stories could be enhanced by showing children's learning developments. Teachers' planning reflects children's interests and parent aspirations. Teachers should now ensure that planning, assessment and evaluation is aligned more closely to the revised <em>Te Whāriki</em> early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The owners and centre manager value and support meaningful professional learning for staff. Emergent leadership among teachers is encouraged. Teachers' involvement with spontaneous and long-term internal evaluation leads to improvements. Owners and leaders recognise the benefit of strengthening internal evaluation and making processes more systematic across the centre.</p><p>The owners have a clear vision for the service. Their strategic thinking around the management of resources, people and property, guide the direction of the centre. Strategic appointments have been made in response to staff taking leave. The centre has a policy framework to guide practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>enhancing teacher skill and capability by providing whole-centre professional learning development across all rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further developing policies and procedures to strengthen staff appraisal, job descriptions, induction and mentoring programmes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening organisational practices that are underpinned by the Māori values of tikanga, manaakitanga and whanaungatanga.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Scribbles Early Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice and comply with legislation, the owners must:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop and implement policies and procedures required as part of the Vulnerable Children's Act 2014, including that all persons that have contact with children are police vetted <em>[Vulnerable Children's Act 2014, GMA7a, appointment processes that include police vetting of staff].</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Scribbles Early Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>2 March 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
