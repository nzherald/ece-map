</table><p>With further support for developing management and leadership, Alphabet Academy Central is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Alphabet Academy Roslyn is one of three education and care services under the Vision Community Trust umbrella. These services are governed by a trust board. Day-to-day management is the responsibility of the supervisor of Alphabet Academy Roslyn.</p><p>Up to 45 children, including 15 up to 2 years of age can attend this city centre at any one time. The roll includes Māori, Fijian, Indian, Asian, African and Pākehā learners.</p><p>A new supervisor was appointed in 2014. Most other staff have worked at the centre for a number of years. Since ERO's 2013 review, the outdoor learning space and playground have been upgraded.</p><p>The centre philosophy is strongly underpinned by Christian values reflecting children's individuality and respecting their God-given talents. It promotes partnership with parents and families.</p><p>Since the March 2013 ERO review, staff have been involved in external professional learning and development (PLD) to assist them to develop self review processes and better promote literacy and mathematics learning.</p><p>Some progress has been made in response to the previous ERO report. Improvement continues to be needed in some of these areas. These feature as key next steps in this report.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three reviews in the Alphabet Academy centres.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s interests inform the programme and are well supported by teachers. Children make decisions about their involvement in learning and demonstrate confidence around each other and with adults. They are self-managing and play cooperatively in small groups. Adults talk with children and demonstrate respect for what they bring to their learning.</p><p>Strengthening planning has been an ongoing development since the previous ERO review. Useful processes have been developed and implemented that support teachers to respond to children's interests. Teachers value and seek the contributions of whānau, sharing information with them in a variety of ways. There is an increased focus on extending children’s learning and making clear links to <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Well-presented achievement journals celebrate each child’s personal development, progress in learning and involvement in centre activities.</p><p>A range of appropriate resources encourage active play, exploration and provide physical challenges. Indoor areas are thoughtfully laid out. Children readily access materials to support their learning. The layout allows for quiet, secluded places as well as larger spaces for group activity. Maths and literacy experiences are successfully promoted in the programme</p><p>Consistent caregiving for infants and toddlers enables teachers to respond sensitively to each child’s needs and preferences. A calm, slow pace provides opportunities for these children to lead their learning.</p><p>Teachers strive to develop children’s sense of belonging and wellbeing. The bicultural perspective of New Zealand is positively reflected in the curriculum. There is a strong commitment to further develop these areas in the centre. Teachers are exploring <em>Tātaiako - Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners.</em> This is likely to further support teachers' knowledge and understanding of culturally responsive practice. All teachers acknowledge children’s different cultures, skills, interests and ways of learning.</p><p>Transitions to, within and beyond the centre are flexible and responsive to meet the needs of individual children and families. Staff have plans to connect with local schools to assist with the transition.</p><p>The strategic plan requires improvement. Consideration should be given to developing a plan that identifies the centres’ priorities for teaching and learning and associated goals to strengthen centre practices and operations. This should assist the manager in monitoring and sharing progress against the goals as part of monthly reporting.</p><p>A positive, collaborative teaching team culture is evident. Internal evaluation is a newly established process that is leading to change and improvement. The process continues to be an area for ongoing development.</p><p>It is timely to clarify and develop shared understanding of roles and responsibilities in governance, management and leadership.</p><p>Processes to assist staff to improve their teaching and ensure shared expectations for high quality education and care require improvement. This includes appraisal processes, annual planning and interactions that encourage and extend children's thinking. The manager needs further support to lead these developments and effectively meet the responsibilities of management and leadership.</p><p>Staff have been supported externally to build their understanding and use of internal evaluation practices. A sound framework is now in place to guide these inquiries. The process continues to require development to more clearly show the impact of teachers’ practices on children’s learning and inform decision making.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre has yet to fully address all areas for development identified in the previous ERO report. Staff need to improve and develop their understanding and practices in:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation to more clearly show the impact of teachers’ practices and learning on children’s outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fostering opportunities for Māori children to experience educational success and extending bicultural practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Processes for developing and growing the practice of teachers, leaders, the manager and trustees need to be improved. This should include improvements to the quality, consistency and monitoring of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>governance and management processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>annual and strategic planning to better inform centre priorities for teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>high quality teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal processes</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Alphabet Academy managers will develop an action plan that shows how they will address the key next steps and actions for compliance across this cluster of services. ERO will monitor progress in relation to the action plan.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Alphabet Academy Roslyn completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring that the service is effectively governed and managed in accordance with good management practices, including review practices, appraisal, annual planning and police vetting.<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, Governance, Management and Administration].</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Alphabet Academy Roslyn will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>12 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
