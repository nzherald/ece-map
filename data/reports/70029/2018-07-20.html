</table><p>YMCA Bishopdale Childcare Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>YMCA Bishopdale Childcare Centre is located within the YMCA Fitness and Recreation Centre. The centre is community-based and is licensed to provide full-day care and education for up to 40 children, including up to 10 under two year olds.</p><p>The centre is purpose built with two separate rooms for the nursery and preschool. There is clear visibility between the rooms. Teachers also use areas in the YMCA building and gym resources to extend children's experiences in physical activities, dance and drama.</p><p>A YMCA CEO works collaboratively with the centre manager to ensure the effective operation of the centre. They are supported by an assistant manager and two head teachers, who have responsibility for the nursery and pre-school areas. A curriculum leader has recently been appointed. Most of the teaching staff are qualified and certified teachers, with some staff in training.</p><p>Children attending the centre come from a wide geographic area and diverse ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>Since the 2015 ERO review, leaders and teachers have made good progress in addressing the key next steps outlined in that report. This includes strengthening assessment and planning, particularly for individuals.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed and supported to settle into the centre. Teachers build strong relationships with all children. Children have many opportunities to make choices and lead their own learning. They are confident with the environment, encouraged to make choices about their play, develop independence and become self-managing learners. Teachers value children's opinions and see children as capable, confident learners and their sense of belonging is actively promoted.</p><p>Children are provided with opportunities to be creative and imaginative in their play. They have easy access to suitable resources that effectively support their interests and extend learning, exploration and enjoyment. Teachers make very good use of the local community to engage children in learning and support their physical and thinking skills.</p><p>Children in the nursery experience nurturing and caring interactions and relationships that support their need for secure attachments with a small number of adults. Infants and toddlers are encouraged to actively explore a range of appropriately challenging play spaces and learning activities. Teachers communicate well with parents to ensure they are meeting each child's needs.</p><p>Teachers provide opportunities for children to learn about Māori culture and language. They are committed to increasing their bi-cultural practice. They now need to review existing bicultural practices and documentation and to strengthen their understandings of te ao Māori perspectives, and parents/whānau aspirations for their children.</p><p>Children's transitions into, within and beyond the centre are well supported by positive relationships between the teachers and families. Decisions on transition times are flexible and responsive to the individual needs of each child and their family.</p><p>Children with identified needs are well supported by teachers and through the use of outside agencies. Teachers share strategies to ensure consistent and continuous support for these children.</p><p>The centre's vision for all children is that they are discoverers who take responsibility for their own learning. There is a strong focus on promoting active learning through a "Mind, Body and Spirit" programme. The centre's vision, values and philosophy is clearly enacted through positive relationships and in the curriculum programme provided for the children.</p><p>YMCA engages an external evaluation provider to survey parent satisfaction. Teachers communicate regularly with families and whānau to make meaningful connections to the children's home life. They successfully include this information into their programme planning for each child.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have a clear focus on continuous improvement, building capability and sustainability. The strategic and annual plan effectively guide the centre's operations and improvements. Comprehensive, policies, procedures and clear systems guide professional practices.</p><p>Effective leadership is promoting collaboration and cooperation within the team. Teachers receive helpful feedback, mentoring and targeted professional development opportunities to build their knowledge and leadership capability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the key next steps to further enhancing outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>explicitly state how children's learning will be extended and the range of teaching strategies that will be used</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate the impact and effectiveness of teaching strategies in order to know which practices are most effective in progressing learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further improve bicultural understanding and practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build aspects of internal evaluation around the centre's strategic goals, vision and professional development.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of YMCA Bishopdale Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of YMCA Bishopdale Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>20 July 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
