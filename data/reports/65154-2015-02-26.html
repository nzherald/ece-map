</table><p>Stoke Montessori is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Stoke Montessori is one of three privately owned Montessori preschools. The owner and some of the teaching team have specialist training and an in-depth understanding of Montessori principles and practices. Montessori philosophy and <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum, are integrated well to support the teaching and learning programme.</p><p>Children and families benefit from the blend of older and younger children learning together, fostering a sense of family and community.</p><p>Since the December 2011 ERO review, there have been some changes in staff and leadership at the preschool. The new team has been together since Term 3, 2014. Clear roles and responsibilities are helping to support new team development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three reviews in the Montessori Preschools' service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Educators actively foster positive and respectful relationships with children and families. They provide ongoing parent education, particularly about the Montessori aspects of the programme. Parent views are regularly sought about aspects of the programme and their aspirations for their children’s learning.</p><p>Children benefit from the wide range of opportunities for learning that are promoted through educators’ strong commitment to the Montessori philosophy integrated with <em>Te Whāriki</em>. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>well-prepared, attractive and purposeful environments</li>
<li>provision of good-quality Montessori equipment</li>
<li>targeted support for literacy and mathematical learning.</li>
</ul><p>Educators have an awareness of their responsibility to Māori learners and are increasing their understanding of te reo and tikanga Māori. Children are well supported to learn about sustainable practices and care for the natural world.</p><p>Educators make good use of the local community to enhance the learning programme offered to children. This includes purposeful links to the local school and relationships with staff to help foster successful transitions.</p><p>Children are encouraged to take responsibility for themselves, others and the environment. Educators provide children with opportunities to contribute to the programme in meaningful ways. They also provide long periods of uninterrupted time for children to be involved in cooperative play and for them to share and develop their ideas.</p><p>Educators model care and respect when working alongside children. They notice and respond to children’s emerging interests in the programme, helping children take the lead in play. Educators have a very good understanding of how Montessori equipment extends children’s specific understandings and learning.</p><p>The owner provides suitable support for the efficient management and operation of the service. Recent developments in strategic and annual planning have helped clarify the service’s priorities and associated goals towards achieving its vision. Educators use a regular, useful and ongoing self-review process to inquire into their practice. The owner and educators are strongly focused on providing positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The preschool owner and educators have identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen self review to develop deeper levels of inquiry and evaluation</li>
<li>increase bicultural perspectives in the environment, programme and teaching practices</li>
<li>build on assessment for learning practices.</li>
</ul><p>ERO has identified that a key next move for the managers is to consider ways that children could have better access to the outside environment in the afternoon programme.</p><p>Since the onsite stage of the review the manager has begun to provide ways that educators from all three preschools can more regularly share strengths and build on best practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Stoke Montessori completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review theservice again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Stoke Montessori will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>26 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
