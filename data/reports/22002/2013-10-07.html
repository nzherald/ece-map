</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Glendene Playcentre operates as a parent cooperative under the guidance and support of Te Akoranga Playcentre Association. The playcentre caters for up to 30 children, including up to 15 infants and toddlers. Children can attend from birth to 6 years of age. The centre is open for three morning sessions each week.</p><p>A key feature of playcentre is that children and parents learn alongside one another which promotes the philosophy of parents as first teachers. Centre practices reflect the aspirations stated in the playcentre’s philosophy.</p><p>Since the last ERO review the course qualification levels of members have increased. Members have been responsive to the recommendations noted in the 2010 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are generally settled and engaged in their play and demonstrate a sense of belonging in the centre. They interact positively with adults and with other children of all ages. Members provide opportunities for children to develop communication and language skills. Children are encouraged to develop confidence in making choices about their play.</p><p>Members are positive and encouraging in their interactions with children. They know children well and are responsive to their strengths and interests. Members actively support the development of children's imaginative play and literacy and numeracy within the contexts of play. Adults are continuing to develop their capability in helping to extend and sustain children's complex play.</p><p>Good systems are in place to identify children’s individual and group interests. Planning, assessment and evaluation focuses on children’s current learning and on the role of adults in supporting and extending ongoing learning. Bicultural practices and perspectives are evident in the programme and learning environment. Parents have made good use of professional development opportunities and more experienced members’ skills and knowledge to increase the group’s capability and confidence in this area. Further consideration could be given to how the cultures and languages of all families attending could be incorporated into programming.</p><p>A good range of activities are provided for children to choose from. Members are flexible in their use of the learning environment and resources to meet children’s interests and to provide them with challenge. Members are planning to further develop the spacious outdoor area to enhance the holistic programme. Centre leaders agree that it would be timely to more formally review how effectively programmes support children’s transition to school.</p><p>Members are continuing to develop a collaborative approach to managing the playcentre. Experienced members and office-holders encourage other members to continue their participation in higher levels of course training. They have accessed support from the playcentre association and other external professional development providers to strengthen the quality of teaching and learning practices. More experienced members are using strategies to grow the capability of newer members.</p><p>The playcentre’s operations and programmes are supported by clear and recently updated policies and procedures. In response to a recommendation in the 2010 ERO report members have undertaken intensive professional development on the use of self review for improvement and have created a good self-review model. An annual management plan provides a framework for decision making and ongoing development. It is timely to refine this plan to take into account immediate and longer term goals for the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and playcentre members agreed on key steps to support ongoing centre improvement and enhance sustainability. These key next steps are:</p><ul>
<li>to further focus capability building with newer members on promoting quality learning interactions</li>
<li>to continue improving shared understandings around curriculum planning so that newer members can participate fully</li>
<li>embedding the use of the new self-review model in order to build the playcentre’s own capacity for ongoing improvement</li>
<li>improving strategic planning processes to include long term strategic goals and documentation of ongoing progress and specific outcomes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Glendene Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance:</p><ul>
<li>The service provider must ensure that safe-fall material in the outdoor environment meets absorbency requirements and is maintained or replaced <em>[Early Childhood Services Regulations 2008, PF13 Outdoor Activity Space, Clause 45(1)(a)].</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Glendene Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>7 October 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
