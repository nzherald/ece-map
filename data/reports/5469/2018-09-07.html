</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Merle Leask Free Kindergarten is one of five kindergartens governed and managed by the Ashburton Kindergarten Association (AKA) in Ashburton. It provides education and care for up to 30 children from two years old to school age, within a culturally diverse community.</p><p>Since the previous ERO report in 2012, there have been changes to the leadership and teaching team. A new head teacher was appointed in 2015. The head teacher and two teachers are responsible for the daily operations and teaching programme in the kindergarten. Professional practice is supported by a contracted education specialist. All teachers are registered and certificated.</p><p>Teachers have made progress with the areas for development identified in the ERO 2012 report. This includes strengthening of assessment, planning and evaluation practices for individuals and groups of children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five kindergartens reviewed in the AKA. The association is a member of the Hakatere Kāhui Ako|Community of Learning (CoL).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten philosophy, 'A place where I can be me', is based on the tikanga Māori values of turangawaewae, aroha, manaakitanga, whanaungatanga and kaitiakitanga. This supports children to develop the valued learning outcomes of relationships, risk taking, working theories and communication.</p><p>The philosophy helps to guide the curriculum and teaching practices. The values are evident in the positive and meaningful relationships that teachers have with children, parents and families/whānau/aiga. Children's cultures are reflected and valued in the programme, environment and resources. This has helped to foster and nurture children's sense of identity, wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>The new teaching team is working well together to build shared understandings and to enact the vision, philosophy and values of the kindergarten. Teachers know the children well and purposefully support them in their learning. Teachers have positive and respectful interactions with children. They use meaningful teaching strategies to respond to the interests, strengths and capabilities of children. Teachers provide children with opportunities to explore the environment and resources at their own pace.</p><p>Teachers prioritise equitable outcomes for all children by ensuring they can access the whole curriculum. When needed, food and clothing are provided to support children’s readiness to learn and ability to make the most of both the indoor and outdoor environments. The AKA deliberately funds a lower teacher to child ratio in this kindergarten to enable teachers to appropriately respond to the needs of younger children and those children with additional needs. Teachers work closely with children, parents/whānau/aiga and external specialists to help children achieve and succeed.</p><p>Cultural diversity is respected and valued in the kindergarten. The head teacher and teachers are committed to implementing a bicultural curriculum that is authentic and meaningful for all children. Teachers are developing respectful, culturally responsive practices. This includes knowledge and understanding about, and respect for, Pacific languages and cultures. The home languages of children are integrated into the curriculum and teaching practices.</p><p>Teachers have established strong partnerships within their local community. Children's learning is enhanced through regular visits to local community places (place-based learning). Key relationships with new-entrant teachers provide ongoing support and well-managed transitions to school for children and their families/whānau/aiga. Leaders and teachers should continue to support children to develop and strengthen their oral language skills, as part of their school readiness process.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to external evaluation processes to improve assessment and planning for children's learning. Teachers' assessment practices value and respond to Māori and Pacific cultures, knowledge and ways of learning. Teachers continue to reflect and challenge their practices through emergent reviews and role modelling from the head teacher. This has helped them to discuss more their understandings of Māori and Pacific concepts in relation to their philosophy and vision.</p><p>The Ashburton Kindergarten Association's vision and strategic goals are well-known and reflected in individual kindergarten annual plans. The association has a sound policy and procedures framework in place to provide guidance for kindergarten operations and the monitoring of health and safety.</p><p>The quality of teaching and learning in each kindergarten is regularly evaluated by the contracted education specialists. These evaluations are detailed and inform association planning and resourcing. Leaders and teachers have access to relevant professional development and leadership support. The association actively supports equity of outcomes for children by funding additional teaching resource and a speech-language therapist to support work with children with additional needs. Some progress has been made in addressing the areas for development from ERO's 2014 review, including supporting a number of leaders and teachers to participate in professional learning about culturally responsive teaching practice. This continues to be an area of focus for the association given the growing diversity of kindergarten rolls.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for teachers, with the support of the Education Support Manager (ESM) are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>build shared understandings to enact the vision and values and to strengthen teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build and develop teachers' cultural capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen engagement with families/whānau/aiga and to find authentic ways to include their voice in children's assessments.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association board, manager and ERO agree that aspects of governance can be improved by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening planning for strategic and annual goals, including identifying relevant measures for knowing about the implementation and impact of goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>better aligning reporting from kindergartens and Kidsfirst education specialists with annual goals in order to know about the implementation and impact of goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving monitoring of planning for, and outcomes for, priority learners across the association</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building the internal evaluation capability of head teachers and teachers, particularly around the collection and analysis of evidence of practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Merle Leask Free Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Merle Leask Free Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>7 September 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
