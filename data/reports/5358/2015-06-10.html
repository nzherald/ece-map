</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Maraeroa Kindergarten is a well-established centre situated in Porirua. The majority of children who attend are from Pacific cultures, with many having English as their second language. Since the August 2012 ERO review, hours of operation have changed and a full-day service now operates for children from two years to school age.</p><p>Maraeroa kindergarten is one of 85 kindergartens and three home-based education and care networks governed and managed by He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). This is a new kindergarten association created from joining the Rimutaka and Wellington Kindergarten Associations in 2014. The transition to the new association is expected to be a three-year process.</p><p>The board and managers role is to provide governance for the organisation. Senior teachers have delegated kindergartens. Their role is to provide regular support and a range of professional learning and development opportunities for teachers.</p><p>All teachers at Maraeroa Kindergarten are qualified and registered. Some, including the head teacher, have many years experience at the kindergarten.</p><p>The August 2012 ERO report for Maraeroa Kindergarten identified that knowledge of whānau aspirations, teacher responsiveness to children's learning and integrating te reo Māori into the programme needed further development. Teachers and leaders have positively responded and made good gains in addressing these areas.</p><p>Areas where the Wellington Kindergarten Association needed to strengthen its support for teachers were also identified at the time. Improvement continues to be needed in some of these areas that the association has plans to address. These feature as key next steps in this report. The alignment of individual kindergartens' annual plans with the association’s strategic priorities has now been addressed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 12 in Whanau Manaaki o Tararua kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers establish a culture in which children are valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning. A welcoming environment fosters a sense of belonging for children and families. The centre philosophy is highly evident in practice.</p><p>Children are central to decision making at Maraeroa Kindergarten. Whanaungatanga, manaakitanga and tuakana teina relationships are evident. Children’s mana is acknowledged. There is a sense of ako, where children, teachers and whānau learn from each other through responsive relationships and interactions.</p><p>Children are confident and capable learners. They play cooperatively in groups of their own choosing and independence is promoted. Teachers are proactive in supporting children with additional needs in an inclusive environment.</p><p>Teachers support children as they move to school. The kindergarten has developed good relationships with local schools, supporting smooth transitions for children. This is an area identified by teachers for further development.</p><p>Assessment portfolios provide a record of children’s participation and involvement in kindergarten experiences and activities. Recent changes to these records to better reflect whānau and the community and group planning processes make children’s learning more visible for parents and families.</p><p>In 2012, the association developed a framework to guide the implementation of its curriculum, Te Manawa<em>.</em> This document outlines criteria for curriculum delivery including expectations for assessment and planning for children’s learning. Maraeroa Kindergarten’s curriculum, what children experience, continues to develop to meet the association's expectations for high quality learning.</p><p>The head teacher and teachers need support to further strengthen their understanding of the self-review process and their knowledge of evaluation. Deeper analysis of information gathered will further enhance the evaluation process.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified that the association needed to improve the appraisal processes. This continues to require strengthening. A recently revised appraisal model, yet to be implemented, includes: more focused goals that build teacher and leader capability; more regular and targeted feedback and feed forward about teaching practice; and clearer links with the Registered Teacher Criteria.</p><p>The senior teacher provides termly written reports that outline agreed development priorities and progress in relation to the quality of teaching and learning. The association has recently implemented new reports that should more deliberately focus on outcomes for children, teachers and leader performance. ERO's evaluation affirms this development.</p><p>Children have opportunities to learn about Aotearoa New Zealand’s dual cultural heritage. Teachers and leaders acknowledge that they are building their capability to be responsive to Māori children’s culture, language and identity. This development should include establishing relationships with mana whenua and making use of Ministry of Education resources such as, <em>Ka Hikitia – Accelerating Success 2013-2017</em> and <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners.</em></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The kindergarten and association have yet to fully address all areas for development identified in the previous 2012 ERO report. The senior teacher, head teacher, staff and ERO agree on the following key next steps. They will:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further develop self review and evaluation understanding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embed recent changes to assessment, planning and evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The senior management team of He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua should continue to further improve processes for growing and developing the practice of teachers, head teachers and senior teachers. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improvements to the quality and monitoring of individual kindergartens and regular implementation of a robust appraisal system</p>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<p>the building of teachers’ capability to be more responsive to Māori children’s culture, language and identity and enhance culturally responsive teaching practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Maraeroa Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Maraeroa Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
