</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Early Discoveries is a well-established early childhood centre catering for fifty children. Located in a residential area of Manurewa, the centre offers full day education and care from 9am to 3pm for children from three to six years of age. The centre caters for a diverse community. Many children speak more than one language and several staff are also bilingual, sharing the children’s cultures and languages.</p><p>Several staff members are new to the service, which continues to be led by very experienced early childhood teachers. This centre has a sister centre located nearby in Weymouth. The centre managers and teachers across the services work closely together sharing management systems, knowledge and expertise.</p><p>Early Discoveries now offers 30 free hours of education to children as part of its strong commitment to supporting families and their children’s education. Parents are welcome to join the management committee, contributing to the centre’s decision making. They are also warmly encouraged to stay in the centre and participate in the programme with their tamariki.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy includes a strong emphasis on Christian values and inclusion. This centre has a silver <em>Enviroschools</em> award reflecting their significant commitment over eight years in promoting environmental education and sustainability. They are now working towards a gold award.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and confidently engage in the programme. They have established genuine friendships with teachers and their peers. Children’s wellbeing and sense of belonging are nurtured through positive interactions, respectful relationships and good care routines.</p><p>There is a purposeful, active atmosphere in the centre. Relationships between teachers, children and families are welcoming, warm and contribute to the centre’s inclusive culture. Teachers are actively involved with children, working alongside them and supporting their play.</p><p>Teachers know children well, respond to parents’ aspirations and use this knowledge to promote opportunities for authentic learning activities. Children develop early literacy and mathematics concepts through their play. Transitions into the centre and on to school are well supported.</p><p>The programme includes opportunities for children to sustain their learning and use open-ended resources. The well-resourced outdoor areas provide good opportunities for physical and imaginative play. Children have good access to a range of equipment that supports their play choices and decisions about their learning. Continuing to review the impact of routines, including meal and mat times, could offer further opportunities for children to revisit their learning.</p><p>Teachers’ awareness and use of te reo and tikanga Māori is evident through use of mihi, karakia and waiata through the programme. They have a strategic plan in place to continue to strengthen the bicultural curriculum. Teachers have goals to continue to implement te reo Māori. They also promote te ao Māori through their environmental kaupapa.</p><p>A new curriculum planning approach is being thoughtfully implemented to respond to children's group and individual interests. The aim to extend children’s learning is worthwhile. As the new teaching team work together to evaluate the success and the positive outcomes for children, leaders are well placed to further support teachers to enhance children’s exploration and communication.</p><p>Individual children’s assessment is also strengthening through a new ‘kaitiaki’ approach where a teacher takes responsibility for a child, noticing their progress and successes. Children’s learning portfolios are attractive records of their engagement in the programme.</p><p>Centre management make very good use of additional Ministry of Education funding to enable families and children to participate together in centre learning experiences. Teachers value and welcome whānau contributions alongside opportunities to learn together in a wide variety of cultural celebrations.</p><p>The centre management has recently joined with the Ministry of Education in an initiative to help improve children's oral language. They are taking a very proactive approach and providing leadership in responding to children's learning requirements in their service.</p><p>Centre managers have maintained and enhanced the centre’s leadership and management strengths from the 2012 ERO review. Effective management systems are very evident. The centre manager's flexible and responsive approach helps create a positive working environment.</p><p>Relevant and well-chosen professional development effectively supports staff development. Performance management has been reviewed and improved to provide teachers with a clear structure with expectations to meet practising teacher requirements.</p><p>A thoughtful and well documented strategic plan guides centre improvement. Centre managers are well placed to continue to refine strategic plans using indicators to evaluate how well the service improves outcomes for children. Plans are clearly focussed on improving children’s learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To continue to promote positive outcomes for children, it would be worthwhile for centre managers to continue to support new teachers in evaluating and documenting the effectiveness of their teaching practices. This could help the new teaching team develop their shared understanding of effective teaching practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Early Discoveries Centre Inc. completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Early Discoveries Centre Inc. will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>17 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
