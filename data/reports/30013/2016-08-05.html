</table><p>The service needs support to further develop the quality of governance and of the teaching and learning.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tower Road Christian Pre School is an all-day and sessional education and care centre located in Matamata. It is governed by a charitable trust, and affiliated with the Matamata Baptist Church. The centre is licensed for 50 children, and has 58 children currently enrolled- 4 are Māori.</p><p>Through its philosophy, the centre views children holistically, with the Bible guiding its practice. Trustees and teachers uphold Christian values, partnerships with families and the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><p>In 2014, the board of trustees undertook a review to restructure the centre to address financial viability, communication between governance and operations, the appointment of a manager, and the management and mentoring of staff. In October 2014, a new manager and several new trustees were appointed. There have also been a number of staffing changes since the restructure began.</p><p>The ERO review in 2013 identified a need to review the balance between teacher and child initiated learning, and the role of trustees. While some progress has been made, there are aspects of governance and teaching that require further development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging, promoted by caring and respectful relationships with adults and peers. They play and learn in a welcoming, peaceful and settled environment. This environment provides opportunities for exploration and experimentation. Children are able to make choices about their learning and play. They engage in a range of sustained play activities, both independently and with others. Teachers now need to consider how to effectively support and extend children's learning.</p><p>Routines and expectations are well understood, and foster the development of responsibility and consideration for self and others. Children interact confidently and oral language skills are well developed.</p><p>Teachers plan activities collaboratively. These plans are related to themes that are centred around children's interests, current events and a Christian curriculum. Literacy and mathematics are integrated in meaningful contexts. Children enjoy investigating the world of natural science.</p><p>Parents and whānau are welcomed and included in the life of the centre. They have good relationships with teachers and appreciate the centre's special character. Teachers know children and their families well. Parents have the opportunity, through informal conversations with teachers and sharing children's portfolios, to build a picture of what their children are interested in, know and can do. Children are supported to develop self-help skills to assist their transition to school.</p><p>Teachers use some te reo and include tikanga Māori in the programme. Celebrations such as Mātariki help to develop an awareness and understanding of Māori concepts. Teachers acknowledge the need to strengthen bicultural practices.</p><p>Trustees and management have adopted a planned approach to the centre restructuring process. The review has focused on improving the quality of care and education. Significant improvements have occurred across centre operations and management systems. These initiatives are in the early stages of development and implementation.</p><p>Trustees bring a range of skills and experiences to their positions. They are committed to the future viability and sustainability of the centre. Roles and responsibilities have been documented, but trustees have yet to effectively enact these.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>There is an urgent need to continue strengthening some governance and management practices. Trustees need to participate in ongoing training to enable them to more effectively carry out their governance roles and responsibilities. Matters requiring attention are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the completion of the review of the centre's philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing strategic goals that clearly identify priorities towards enacting and achieving the centre philosophy and purpose. These need to be supported by appropriate actions and resources to enable them to be achieved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>immediate updating of all centre policies and procedures, particularly in the area of personnel and health and safety.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Centre practices in teaching and learning need strengthening. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing a shared understanding of self review, focused on teaching and learning practice in order to implement and build teachers' capability in using a range of teaching strategies and practices to support and extend children's learning. This should be supported by appropriate professional learning and development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening teachers' capability and confidence in including bicultural practices in the daily programme and routines.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tower Road Christian Pre School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Action for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to personnel. To meet requirements the service needs to ensure that annual appraisal of teaching staff by the centre manager includes all of the Practicing Teacher Criteria.</p><p><em>[Part 31 Education Act 1989, New Zealand Education Gazette and relevant Collective Employment Agreement]</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops and implements an appropriate plan to effectively address the key next steps and action outlined in this ERO report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tower Road Christian Pre School will be within two years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>5 August 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
