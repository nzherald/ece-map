</table><p>Wairoa Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wairoa Playcentre is located in Wairoa. The centre provides two weekly morning sessions for 30 children, including 13 up to the age of two. At the time of this review, there were 20 children enrolled.</p><p>The centre is administered by Playcentre Aotearoa, Central North Island Region and is supported by a regional manager. National policies are in the process of being developed and distributed to playcentres for implementation.</p><p>The Playcentre Aotearoa philosophy, 'whānau tupu ngātahi – families growing together', is to empower parents and children to learn, play and grow together. Alongside this, the centre philosophy promotes positive learning experiences to enable children to become confident and competent lifelong learners within a safe, supportive environment.</p><p>Whānau and families are valued as the primary educators of their children and share responsibility for the curriculum. Day-to-day operation is undertaken by session support personnel and centre elected office holders. A newly employed centre support worker is beginning to regularly visit playcentres to provide professional guidance and support, strengthen practice and promote improvement.</p><p>The February 2016 ERO report identified key next steps for ongoing development at Wairoa Playcentre. These included: assessment, planning and evaluation; building te ao Māori practices; and strengthening knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation. ERO recommended that the association support the centre to develop a plan that outlines how they address these key next steps. Although some progress is evident, these areas still require further development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five playcentres in the Tairāwhiti area.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children lead their own learning within a well resourced environment that promotes their exploration of a wide range of activities. A focus on supporting whānau culture and language within the programme supports an inclusive environment. Positive relationships between parents and adults enhance a sense of belonging. The playcentre philosophy is evident in practice.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are nurtured within a culture of care. They demonstrate that they are confident and competent learners in an environment that is responsive to their needs. Attentive adults engage in meaningful conversations to encourage early language development. Routines provide opportunities to foster children's independence and wellbeing. Older children play amicably alongside their younger peers. Tuakana teina relationships are evident.</p><p>Te ao Māori and tikanga Māori are purposefully woven through rituals, including karakia and waiata. Regular participation in local community excursions provides meaningful connections to local iwi areas of significance. Guidance from whānau Māori is positively informing centre practices. Further strengthening te ao Māori knowledge and use of te reo continues to be a next step.</p><p>A useful planning framework supports parents to develop individualised learning goals for their children. Members work collaboratively to provide a programme that is responsive to their aspirations and children's interests and needs. Individual assessment portfolios capture the progression of learning across the breadth of the curriculum. Further developing all members' understanding of meaningful assessment and planning should strengthen consistent practices.</p><p>During a time of change, parents continue to build their knowledge and understanding of the Playcentre way of being. New parents are well supported by experienced centre members to take on official roles and responsibilities. Leaders have identified that a priority is to further access relevant support from the newly employed centre support worker and Playcentre Aotearoa, Central Region to gain professional guidance, support and strengthen practice to promote improvement.</p><p>A regular cycle of review is leading to positive changes to the environment. Session evaluations provide relevant information to develop responsive strategies for children who may require additional support. Leaders have identified that a next step is to strengthen their understanding of internal evaluation for improvement.</p><p>Playcentre’s national restructuring process has significantly hindered the support and professional development provided to centre members. Regional personnel are in the early stages of rebuilding collaboration and support networks. National systems and processes are yet to be consistently implemented. There is a recent focus on building relational trust and a responsive parent education system to establish more effective operations. A key next step is for regional managers to ensure that expected levels of support occur for each centre.</p><p>The appraisal process is currently based on annual review of successes and challenges. This requires further strengthening to better reflect roles and responsibilities, building of capability and evaluation of performance aligned to outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At playcentre level, priorities are to develop and continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>use of assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kaiako understanding and use of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori to improve the delivery of the bicultural curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen understanding of children's culture, language and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop understanding and use of effective internal evaluation for improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>At the governance level (Playcentre Aotearoa), priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to develop and implement national policies and procedures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure ongoing support and education is provided to centre members to grow understanding of quality early childhood education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the appraisal process for employed staff.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the regional team actively monitors and evaluates the quality of support provided to playcentres to promote improvement.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wairoa Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current compliance practice Playcentre Aotearoa must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a regular cycle of policy review is undertaken. The organisation has stated that the implementation of national policies will take place at the beginning of August 2019</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the playcentre establishes a shared understanding of the purpose and use of the newly built bench outside the kitchen and once its use is determined there are appropriate procedures in place.</p>
</li>

ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
