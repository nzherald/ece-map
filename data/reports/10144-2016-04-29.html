</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Whangarei Hospital Play &amp; Recreation operates under the policies and management of Whangarei Hospital. The playroom is located in the children's ward and is open Monday to Friday 8:00am to 4:30pm. It provides resources and play opportunities for children aged from birth to 16 years of age who are admitted to the ward. The service caters for high numbers of Māori children and their whānau, and this is representative of the community the hospital serves.</p><p>The playroom is staffed by two Full Time Equivalent Hospital Play Specialists (HPS) who are qualified and registered early childhood teachers. At the time of this ERO review the service also employed 2 Full Time Equivalent registered teachers. Flexible staffing means that there are five staff on the team, some of whom share a job. They work as part of a multidisciplinary team which also includes a range of other healthcare professionals.</p><p>The aim of the HPS is to deliver a holistic service that provides a nurturing learning environment. Their key role is to minimise psychological stress and enhance coping capacities for hospitalised children and their families/whānau by providing educational programmes and therapeutic play, making resources available at children's bedside and, at times, visiting other sites and clinics in the hospital.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2012 staffing has remained consistent and many staff have been long serving. Volunteers and community groups continue to give their time, contributing to children's wellbeing while they are in hospital. HPS have undertaken some reviews in order to improve outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Hospital Play Specialists (HPS) work in partnership with families. They invite them to participate in and contribute to playroom activities. HPS are skilled at quickly developing respectful and trusting relationships with children and their families/whānau. They consult with parents about possible strategies to help children cope with medical procedures. Positive relationships between families and HPS promote open communication and assist HPS to reduce whānau stress and anxiety during their time in hospital. A sense of belonging and wellbeing for children and their whānau is strongly nurtured.</p><p>The playroom provides children and their families with an inclusive, relaxed, calm environment. Children have access to a good range of resources. These include purposefully designed play equipment to enable children to make sense of, and better understand, medical equipment and procedures. HPS put thought into providing a range of experiences and activities to support children's diverse strengths, interests and needs. Children enjoy the opportunity to play alongside other children and confidently participate in playroom activities.</p><p>HPS have a good understanding of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Programme planning is highly responsive to the interests and the complexity of children's circumstances. HPS make learning meaningful and challenging. Children's learning dispositions are well supported through child-initiated play and learning. HPS engage in play with children and promote their exploration and creativity. Learning concepts such as literacy and mathematics are naturally included in play experiences.</p><p>HPS notice, recognise and respond to children's emerging interests and needs. Therapeutic play at children's bedside and in the playroom is used to minimise psychological trauma and to help children to gain a sense of understanding and control.</p><p>HPS are strong advocates for children and their families. They listen to children's and parent's requests and respond appropriately. Long-term patients or patients who return regularly to hospital have profile books that contain photographs of children participating in fun learning experiences with others. HPS have developed a range of effective communication practices to link with early childhood services that children have been attending prior to hospitalisation so that children can retain contact and HPS can learn more about children's wider life experiences.</p><p>HPS have established practices that respect and acknowledge tikanga Māori practices. They acknowledge the need to further develop this aspect of the programme by introducing more te reo Māori, local history and kawa. Many parents contribute their expertise in this area, resulting in a learning environment where children and adults learn together.</p><p>Hospital managers provide HPS with ongoing professional development opportunities to help them keep up to date with current recommended practices. HPS have established useful professional relationships with other hospital play specialists to share practices and initiatives.</p><p>HPS often discuss and reflect on programmes and the support they provide for children and their families. They have undertaken some internal evaluation that has contributed to ongoing improvement in the service they provide. They are continuing to develop their self-review processes to enable them to better evaluate the effectiveness of their practice, service operations and outcomes for children and whānau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and play specialists contributed to the identification of the service's next steps for ongoing improvement. These focus on continuing to develop and implement:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>planned and strategic self review to systematically monitor and evaluate the quality of their own practice, and to make informed evidence-based decisions for ongoing improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>robust policy review to reflect legislation changes, particularly those connected to The Vulnerable Children's Act and associated implications for HPS practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a Tiriti-based curriculum and bicultural practices that more effectively reflect Māori as tangata whenua.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends HPS access external professional development to support them in developing and implementing planned and strategic reviews that are clearly linked to the service's strategic and annual plans and staff appraisal, and that are used to inform management and HPS decisions.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Whangarei Hospital Play &amp; Recreation completed an <em>ERO Hospital-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Whangarei Hospital Play &amp; Recreation will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>29 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service responds to children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the methodology for ERO reviews in Hospital-based Education and Care Services.</p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to contribute to children’s learning and promote their wellbeing. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"><span>ERO’s website</span>.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that contribute to children’s learning and wellbeing and are useful to the service.</p>
