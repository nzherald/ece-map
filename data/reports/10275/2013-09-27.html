</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres (18) Dannemora caters for up to 139 children including up to 45 babies. The centre is part of the Kindercare Learning Centres organisation (KLC) which provides a framework of governance and management. The organisation also supplies professional advice and support to the centre.</p><p>A new centre director has recently been appointed and is ably supported by the Kindercare Area Manager, Curriculum Manager, Team Leaders, and long serving staff.</p><p>The KLC philosophy has as its core value flexible learning that enables children to grow at their own pace and this forms the basis of all the operations at the centre. Clear priority is given to keeping the child, ‘safe, loved and learning’ in the centre's spacious, warm, purpose built environment.</p><p>The 2010 ERO report noted that children and families were welcomed into the centre and children were provided with good care. These features have been sustained. The 2010 ERO report recommended that staff should continue to develop skills in planning and implementing programmes that recognise and respond to children’s emerging interests and dispositions. The centre has made progress in this area, particularly for babies and toddlers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are friendly, settled and demonstrate a sense of belonging in the centre. They engage positively with their peers and are able to select indoor and outdoor activities independently. Children respond well to routines and benefit from caring and nurturing relationships with staff. Respectful relationships between staff and parents/whānau are evident.</p><p>The well resourced learning environment offers children easy access to equipment and multiple opportunities for learning. Teachers have focused on providing inviting, attractive and homely play areas.</p><p>Centre programmes are linked to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. Teachers offer a balanced programme of planned activities and responses to children’s emerging interests. They have established strategies to plan for programmes that meet children’s need and have developed practices to make children’s learning more visible.</p><p>Currently, there is a focus on developing children’s early literacy and numeracy skills and supporting their social and emotional development. Parents are informed about and invited to respond to regular updates of their children’s learning and development records. Teachers support children well as they transition through the centre.</p><p>Teachers are well qualified and reflect the cultural diversity of the centre. They participate in regular professional learning and have begun to reflect on their teaching practice to identify strategies to improve the programme for children.</p><p>The centre is well governed and managed. Effective systems and policies are in place to guide centre operations. Strategic centre goals align with the centre’s philosophy and are linked to staff appraisals and best practice in early childhood education. Including the Ministry of Education’s resource, <em>Tātaiako</em>, in the appraisal and self-review processes could help strengthen teachers’ practice and cultural competence.</p><p>Managers promote a centre culture that is improvement focused through a self-review process that includes consulting with parents. Managers have identified that a future focus will be deeper analysis of self review information to determine next steps.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the Kindercare Learning Centres managers and director agree that the centre’s key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>build centre wide capability in bicultural practices and fostering success for Māori children</li>
<li>enhance awareness of success for children with Pacific heritages</li>
<li>review and strengthen communication with parents about the transition to school programme using the guidelines for transitioning to school provided by <em>Te Whāriki</em></li>
<li>continue developing consistent centre-wide teaching practice and expectations.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres (18) Dannemora completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement</em> and <em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3><span>Next ERO Review</span></h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres (18) Dannemora will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>27 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
