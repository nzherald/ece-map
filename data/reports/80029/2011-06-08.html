<a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Wild Things (One) is one of five schemes that belong to the Wild Things Ltd. Home Based Care Service. The service has undergone significant expansion since the last review. Wild Things (One) has two visiting teachers. One supports the nannies in the network in promoting the wellbeing and learning of the children in their care. The second visiting teacher is responsible for the induction of educators who have recently joined the service.</p><p>Nannies and educators bring a diverse range of experience and qualifications to their role. A focus for this scheme in 2011 is encouraging new educators to complete some minimum external training requirements.</p><p>Children enjoy warm, caring and responsive relationships with their nannies, educators and visiting teachers. The adults know the children well. The nannies and educators welcome the support of their visiting teacher and appreciate the additional resources they provide. The visiting teachers spoke positively of the open and responsive relationships they have with their directors.</p><p>Children have access to a wide range of interesting experiences in and outside the home environment. Nannies and educators follow the children’s interests in the activities and resources they provide. They are expected to bring the children to sessions that the service runs each week in Dunedin. Children and their nannies and educators can socialise during regular larger-group outings organised by the service. Educators and nannies regularly take children on outings to various community and civic facilities as part of their planned programme.</p><p>The areas for review and development in this scheme and across the service relate mainly to aspects of governance. These need to be improved if children are ultimately to receive maximum benefit from their time with the service. They include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>consolidation of roles, responsibilities and expectations of directors, visiting teachers, educators and nannies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extending self-review processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening partnerships with parents, including the whānau of Māori children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>There are some inconsistencies in health and safety practices in this scheme and across the service that the directors must work with the visiting teachers to address.</p><p>At the time of the review, the service had recently completed the Ministry of Education (MOE) relicensing process for this network under the 2008 regulations. The service had developed some additional documentation to meet the new requirements. The directors and visiting teachers were taking steps to put these into practice as part of the implementation phase agreed to with the MOE. It was too early for ERO to evaluate the impact of these changes.</p><p>The directors have agreed with ERO’s recommendation that they develop an action plan that addresses the governance and management issues raised in this report.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the network again within 3 years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Wild Things Ltd (One) was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by Wild Things Ltd (One) to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the service (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atWild Things Ltd (One).</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment;</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>aspects of governance and management systems of the organisation.</li>
</ul><p>ERO’s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The Wild Things vision is “all about providing an environment where children can be children”. The service aims to create nurturing and caring environments that enrich a child’s life by firing their imagination, stimulating their thinking and letting them have fun.</p><p>ERO reviewed what was happening for children in the homes of two educators, and in two homes employing nannies. The number of children in each home visited ranged from one to three. Reviewers also sampled documentation from the service, the visiting teachers and a range of nannies and educators currently in the scheme. This network, along with others in the service, is working in 2011 towards extending the focus on children’s learning.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><em>Relationships.</em> Children benefit from nurturing and responsive relationships with their nannies and educators. The small group size in the home environment allows the children to get to know one another well and educators and nannies form close trusting bonds with the children and their families. The visiting teachers are in regular contact with the educators and nannies and support in providing the programmes in the homes. The directors work in an open and responsive way with the visiting teachers, giving and receiving feedback and suggestions for making improvements.</p><p><em>Children’s engagement in the programmes.</em> In the sample of homes visited, ERO found that children were absorbed in what they were doing. They made choices about what they wanted to do and their preferences were respected. The educators and nannies knew the children’s needs and interests and were building on these. In the best examples, ERO observed educators and nannies who were extending children’s learning by providing additional resources and experiences and having conversations which had a focus on helping children to learn.</p><p><em>Range of experiences.</em> Children benefit from a wide range of experiences provided by nannies and educators. Many experiences are provided within the daily routines of being at home. Activities included baking, art and craft, gardening, playing outdoors and practical early literacy and numeracy, such as writing a letter to Santa or recognising the letterbox numbers. Children had a good range of resources in some stimulating environments.</p><p><em>Connecting links with wider world.</em> Children’s opportunities to learn are enhanced by the many and varied excursions provided by Wild Things and by their educators and nannies. Children, with their nannies and educators, are able to attend a Wild Things playgroup and music group. Profile books show children enjoying many outings in the local community.</p><h4>Area for development and review</h4><p><em>Focus on learning.</em> The focus on learning needs to be stronger and more consistent. Children’s profiles are attractive records of interesting activities and outings. Some educators and nannies are beginning to make links to Te Whāriki to show what learning may have occurred. There is little evidence of educators and nannies identifying the next steps for learning or later building on the learning to show the progress that has been made. Visiting teachers have begun to make use of a toolkit to help educators and nannies build their confidence in planning for learning, but agree that there is more to be done to improve current practice. They plan to record more consistently what aspirations parents have for their children and their children’s learning. [Recommendation 5.1, Action 4.1, Action 4.2]</p><h3>Governance and Management</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>During the review ERO identified some concerns about the effectiveness of aspects of governance and management and decided to investigate these issues further in light of the potential impact on outcomes for children. Some of the areas for review and development identified in this report appeared as recommendations in the June 2008 report.</p><h4>Area of strength</h4><p><em>Team culture.</em> The directors foster the development of a collaborative and reflective team culture between themselves and their team. The visiting teachers and the directors meet formally once a term to share ideas and plan together. The directors have established regular meetings with educator representatives to share information. They provide opportunities for educators and nannies to come together, for example, the recent tenth birthday celebrations and professional development evenings.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p><em>Self review.</em> The directors and visiting teachers acknowledge and ERO agrees, that self review is an area for further development. They are not yet meeting the requirements of their policy which states there is a one to three year planned review schedule to cover all areas of practice. There is not a current strategic plan to review against and the last planned review that began in March 2009 is incomplete. [Recommendation 5.2, Action 4.3]</p><p><em>Consolidation and consistency of roles, responsibilities and expectations.</em> The directors and visiting teachers have identified and ERO agrees that there is a need for consistency and consolidation across the service. They have identified through their own self review that there is a need for shared understanding across the service about the purpose of the visiting teachers’ visits to educators and nannies. In this scheme the visiting teachers’ report forms have a focus on what children have been doing rather than what they may have been learning. The reports contained few next steps or suggestions of strategies to help the educators and nannies in their work.</p><p>The directors do not have clear expectations about what they want to know about Wild Things (One), or see in the visiting teachers’ reports. As a result they have insufficient information about patterns and trends that are occurring within the scheme. ERO found examples where what was written as a policy or practice statement has yet to match the practice within the network. This is an area that the service plans to address as part of the phased implementation of the new regulations.</p><p>A new requirement for nannies and educators is to have a training plan to support ongoing professional learning. As few of these have been developed it is too soon to know how effective these are. The visiting teachers have been appraised and have developed some useful goals for professional development. Although not a requirement it would be good practice for the directors to be regularly appraised, particularly in light of the governance and management issues identified in this report.<em> [Recommendation 5.3, Action 4.3]</em></p><p><em>Health and Safety.</em> ERO found some inconsistent health and safety practices during the course of the review. The directors have assured ERO that visiting teachers are now required to record restraint procedures on their hazard management plans in line with the Wild Things 2010 policy relating to the care and restraint of animals. Expectations for dealing with known hazards such as unsecured heavy bookcases and flat screen televisions need to be reinforced with, and by, visiting teachers. <em>[Recommendation 5.4, Action 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7]</em></p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with Whānau of Māori Children in Early Childhood Services</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of Māori children and their whānau, particularly when the child and whānau transition to the service</li>
<li>visiting teachers and educators have built relationships with whānau of Māori children</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with whānau of Māori children.</li>
</ul><p>There are 6 Māori children currently enrolled in this service.</p><h4>Background</h4><p>The service has a written commitment to partnership and consultation with parents, guardians and whānau. It has identified the need to strengthen partnerships with whānau Māori as part of a general focus on finding out more about the aspirations of all parents for their children. From 2011, visiting teachers are expected, when enrolling a child, to ask parents/whānau what is important for the child in relation to their culture.</p><p>Since March 2009, the service has been working towards implementing a stronger bicultural dimension in the programme. For example, new language resources have been shared with visiting teachers, nannies and educators, and some internal professional development around aspects of Māori culture has been offered.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>ERO recommends that the directors and visiting teachers:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review the effectiveness of initiatives to promote greater understanding of Māori language and culture, and the outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the effectiveness of strategies for deepening the partnerships with whānau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance the use of te reo Māori in the programme, with a greater reflection of bicultural perspectives in learning environments.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The service should consider the above areas when working towards Recommendation 5.5.</p><p>4. Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</p><a id="overview" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Overview</h2><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Wild Things Ltd (One) completed an ERO Home-Based Care Management Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>During the course of the review ERO identified some significant areas of non-compliance. In order to address these, the directors, with the visiting teachers, must ensure that:</p><p>4.1 the curriculum is informed by planning, assessment and evaluation that demonstrates an understanding of children’s learning, interests, whānau, and life contexts <em>[C2(2008)]</em></p><p>4.5.the practices of educators and coordinators demonstrate an understanding of children’s learning and development and knowledge of relevant theories and practice in early childhood education <em>[C4(2008)]</em></p><p>4.6.they implement an ongoing process of self review <em>[GMA5(2008)]</em></p><p>4.7.there are regular checks of equipment, premises and facilities for hazards to children <em>[HS 11(2008)]</em></p><p>4.8.they work with educators and nannies to analyse accident records to identify hazards and take appropriate action and take all practicable steps to eliminate, isolate or minimise hazards to the safety of children <em>[HS11 (2008)]</em></p><p>4.9.heavy furniture, fixtures and equipment that could fall or topple and cause serious injury or damage are secured. <em>Source [HS6(2008)]</em></p><a id="5-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Recommendations</h2><p>ERO recommends that the directors and visiting teachers:</p><p>5.1 improve the focus on teaching and learning5.2 further develop and implement self-review schedules, procedures and practices5.3 improve the clarity and consistency of expectations across the service5.4 improve the consistency of health and safety practices and policies5.5 continue to develop a bicultural dimension in the programme, including partnerships with Māori whānau.</p><a id="6-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6. Future Action</h2><p>ERO is likely to review the network again within 3 years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>8 June 2011</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-wild-things-ltd-one" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Wild Things Ltd (One)</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office’s latest report onWild Things (One) is one of five schemes that belong to the Wild Things Ltd. Home Based Care Service. The service has undergone significant expansion since the last review. Wild Things (One) has two visiting teachers. One supports the nannies in the network in promoting the wellbeing and learning of the children in their care. The second visiting teacher is responsible for the induction of educators who have recently joined the service.</p><p>Nannies and educators bring a diverse range of experience and qualifications to their role. A focus for this scheme in 2011 is encouraging new educators to complete some minimum external training requirements.</p><p>Children enjoy warm, caring and responsive relationships with their nannies, educators and visiting teachers. The adults know the children well. The nannies and educators welcome the support of their visiting teacher and appreciate the additional resources they provide. The visiting teachers spoke positively of the open and responsive relationships they have with their directors.</p><p>Children have access to a wide range of interesting experiences in and outside the home environment. Nannies and educators follow the children’s interests in the activities and resources they provide. They are expected to bring the children to sessions that the service runs each week in Dunedin. Children and their nannies and educators can socialise during regular larger-group outings organised by the service. Educators and nannies regularly take children on outings to various community and civic facilities as part of their planned programme.</p><p>The areas for review and development in this scheme and across the service relate mainly to aspects of governance. These need to be improved if children are ultimately to receive maximum benefit from their time with the service. They include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>consolidation of roles, responsibilities and expectations of directors, visiting teachers, educators and nannies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extending self-review processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening partnerships with parents, including the whānau of Māori children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>There are some inconsistencies in health and safety practices in this scheme and across the service that the directors must work with the visiting teachers to address.</p><p>At the time of the review, the service had recently completed the Ministry of Education (MOE) relicensing process for this network under the 2008 regulations. The service had developed some additional documentation to meet the new requirements. The directors and visiting teachers were taking steps to put these into practice as part of the implementation phase agreed to with the MOE. It was too early for ERO to evaluate the impact of these changes.</p><p>The directors have agreed with ERO’s recommendation that they develop an action plan that addresses the governance and management issues raised in this report.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the network again within 3 years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood service we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the service or see the ERO website, www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information About Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood services; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each service’s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO’s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li>Quality of Education – including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li>Additional Review Priorities – other aspects of the operation of a service, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li>National Evaluation Topics – This strand contribute to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li>Compliance with Legal Requirements – assurance that this service has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this service.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a service is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this service.</p>
