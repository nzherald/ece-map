</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Leap Ahead Early Childhood Centre is a spacious, purpose-built, privately-owned centre in Methven. It provides full-day education and care for children from three months to five years of age. It is licenced for 41 children including 14 under two years old. The centre operates as two rooms. This service opened in 2011 and this is its first ERO review.</p><p>The vision for this centre includes being an integral part of the community. Its philosophy is for children to; learn through play, feel safe and secure, explore, discover and experiment.</p><p>The owner/licensee is a member of the management team along with the head teacher and centre manager. A head teacher and lead teacher guide each room's teaching team. Most of the staff are qualified EC teachers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play and learn in an environment where their needs/care and interests are well provided for. Interactions between teachers and children are positive and respectful. Children's contributions, ideas and interests are encouraged, valued and shared. Teaching practices and engaging activities extend children's interests. Some activities for children link closely with seasonal and current events, and resources in the local community.</p><p>Children's learning is well planned for. Programme planning is well-informed by evidence-based, formative assessment of learning for individuals and groups of children. Teachers use very good systems to analyse children's learning and progress. Priorities for children's learning are effectively shared with the teaching team and reflected in children's learning stories.</p><p>Children also benefit from:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>well-managed transitions into, through and out of the centre to school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an environment and practices that are adapted to meet the changing needs of children under two</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a developing bicultural programme (including tikanga and te reo Māori) where concepts valued by Māori are shared and encouraged</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learning areas and activities that encourage them to be physically active.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Centre managers have developed and embedded effective systems for smooth day-to-day running of the centre. Routines for children are well understood, flexible and followed. There are clearly defined expectations for teachers with systems and prompts to ensure these are met. A very useful strategic plan has been implemented which identifies key priorities and guides future developments.</p><p>Centre leaders have deliberatively built a very cohesive, collaborative teaching team who communicate well to support children's needs. Relationships among staff are inclusive and positive. Leaders have high expectations and provide effective guidance and support to achieve these. Managers and teachers are reflective and improvement focused. They have made a very good start to using self review for improvement with the help of some external professional learning and development (PLD). A more evaluative approach within this will strengthen self review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have identified and ERO agrees that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>exploring and extending ways in which the centre communicates with parents (including parents' contribution to their children's learning) will strengthen the home-centre partnership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the use of te reo Māori and the understanding of tikanga and te ao Māori in all aspects of children's learning needs strengthening.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO recommends and leaders agree that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the regular review of the centre's philosophy could focus more on the desired outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the planned self-review schedule needs to be extended to include all key aspects of the centre's operations that affect children's care and education over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opportunities for PLD beyond the centre would further strengthen teachers' professional capability.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Leap Ahead Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Leap Ahead Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>14 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
