</table><p>Hikurangi Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hikurangi Kindergarten is one of 22 kindergartens governed and managed by the Northland Kindergarten Association (NKA). Some children and their whānau in this rural community travel long distances to attend the kindergarten.</p><p>A head teacher and two other qualified teachers make up the teaching team. The kindergarten's vision and philosophy guide teachers' practices. Teachers believe in warm, respectful relationships. They value and welcome whānau contributions and acknowledge their aspirations.</p><p>The teaching team has been part of the trial work for the development of <em>The Hikairo Schema.</em> The emphasis of their work has been on building culturally responsive practices in the kindergarten setting. The outcomes of this work are clearly evident.</p><p>Since the 2015 ERO review there has been good progress in addressing the key next steps identified. Some aspects, such as evaluating the effectiveness of the learning programme, are ongoing work for the team.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine kindergarten reviews in the Northland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are welcomed enthusiastically each day into the kindergarten whānau and are quick to settle into their play. They are well cared for and their learning is nurtured by attentive teachers. Children are well supported to know their place in the world, to grow in confidence and be proud of who they are. Teachers are strongly committed to supporting children to achieve this aspiration.</p><p>Children work for long periods of uninterrupted time to explore and engage in learning. They have freedom to choose from a wide variety of exciting resources and inviting play spaces. Some children use resources innovatively to extend their play in creative ways.</p><p>Teachers deliberately prepare the environment to encourage children to work in pairs and cooperative groups that foster friendships. There are also opportunities for children to play alone to explore ideas and resources at their own pace.</p><p>Teachers challenge children to meet high expectations and strongly support them to experience success. They have a purposeful approach to building children's social skills and language development. Teachers celebrate children's achievements to help increase their competence and confidence as learners and leaders.</p><p>Teachers know children and their whānau well. They integrate te reo Māori skilfully and naturally into daily programmes and the life of the kindergarten. Children use te reo in their play with understanding and context. They experience many aspects of the kupu inherent in <em>The Hikairo Schema</em> approaches. These are affirmed through the value placed by teachers on whanaungatanga, manaakitanga and the inclusive interactions between teachers, children and whānau.</p><p>Parents who spoke with ERO deeply appreciate the teachers and their welcoming approaches to whānau. They expressed the importance of the kindergarten as a central community place for children and whānau. Teachers have close connections to the community.</p><p>Teachers could make their planning and children's learning progress more visible in documentation. It would be worthwhile to record important teaching conversations about children's learning. Documentation should include children's next learning steps and planned teaching strategies. Robust evaluation should examine the effectiveness of learning, teaching and curriculum provision.</p><p>Professional practice managers (PPM) regularly visit kindergartens to provide leadership and curriculum guidance for teachers. A Pou Whakarewa Tikanga Māori Advisor works closely with teachers to increase their understanding of and focus on authentically threading te ao Māori into learning programmes. There is an organisation-wide emphasis on providing high quality resources and equipment for children. Leaders and teachers value and respect the thoughtful use of natural resources.</p><p>The Association provides a comprehensive policy and procedure framework that sets clear expectations and guides teachers’ practice. It has developed relevant appraisal and teacher inquiry processes that reflect the Teaching Council’s guidelines. Each kindergarten’s annual plan aligns to the Association’s strategic vision, values and goals. NKA employs a speech language therapist and seconds a social worker from Family Works to provide targeted support for children, whānau and teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>reviewing the kindergarten's philosophy in relation to teachers' new learning from <em>The Hikairo Schema,</em> in consultation with the kindergarten community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further developing assessment, planning and evaluation processes to make learning and teaching more visible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the evaluative aspects of internal evaluation and annual plan monitoring.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Key next steps for Association-wide development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing assessment, planning and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepening understanding of evaluative thinking and internal evaluation processes to measure the effectiveness of systems and practices across the Association.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hikurangi Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>15 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">.</a><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"></a></span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
