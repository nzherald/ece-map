</table><p>Oasis Education Centre does not have the governance and management systems and practices needed to sustain performance and build capacity to promote positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>The centre has made little progress in meeting the recommendations in the 2013 ERO report. Strategic planning, learning assessment, programme planning and evaluation, and increasing te ao Māori in the programme remain areas for development.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Oasis Education Centre is one of four centres managed by Oasis Preschools and caters for children from two years to school age. The centre has a strong Christian philosophy that underpins all aspects of management and practice.</p><p>The centre's team leader and many of the staff are experienced early childhood teachers who have been employed at the centre for a number of years. The majority of the teachers are fully qualified early childhood teachers. The managers also employ support staff to enable the teachers to spend their time teaching and caring for the children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews in the Oasis Preschools.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are independent and motivated learners in the outdoor environment. They make very good use of the interesting, challenging and well-resourced area to extend their learning and to develop investigation and problem-solving skills.</p><p>Teachers use a range of effective strategies to help children become confident learners who work cooperatively to achieve successful outcomes.</p><p>Parents willingly share their expertise to benefit all children. They provide interesting comments on their children's learning that link closely to children's interests and their involvement in the programme. Positive relationships between parents and teachers are supporting the sharing of information and building closer links between home and centre learning experiences.</p><p>Māori children confidently share their expertise in te reo and tikanga Māori with other children and teachers as a result of their parent's involvement in the programme.</p><p>The management framework for Oasis Preschools has few established systems or processes to sustain and improve learning outcomes for children. Internal evaluation, teacher appraisal, strategic planning, and targeted professional development are at early stages of development. Systems and practices for effective planning, monitoring, and evaluation are not well understood or implemented by leaders and teachers. Managers are not able to achieve the service's long-term goals or evaluate the effectiveness of learning, teaching and professional development on outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the service leaders agree that the key next steps for Oasis Preschools are to build leadership capacity and capability across the Oasis management team. To achieve this objective the service leaders need to:</p><ul>
<li>define the roles and responsibilities of the management team members</li>
<li>develop an in-depth understanding of internal evaluation, ensure evaluations are well documented and show evidence of the process and outcomes for children's learning</li>
<li>develop strategic and annual planning that shows how the key priorities will be achieved, regularly monitored, evaluated and reported </li>
<li>ensure the teacher appraisal processes meet the Education Council requirements</li>
<li>establish closer links between the strategic plan goals and professional development</li>
<li>improve the clarity of reports to staff on their centre's performance to ensure expectations and next steps are well understood, implemented and evaluated.</li>
</ul><p>The service leaders and ERO agree that the next key steps for Oasis Education Centre include:</p><ul>
<li>integrating more of the teaching and learning practices evident in the outdoor environment into the indoor programme</li>
<li>evaluating the place of whole-centre group times to support a child-led programme</li>
<li>developing child assessment, programme planning and evaluation practices to promote high quality learning and teaching practices</li>
<li>increasing te ao Māori in the programme and centre documents.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Oasis Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management. To meet requirements the service must improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>ensuring teachers' appraisals meet the requirements of the Education Council to maintain or become certificated teachers</li>
<li>establishing and maintaining effective governance and management practices, particularly internal evaluation and professional development that links to the achievement of the service's strategic goals.</li>
</ul><p><em>[47(1) Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008] </em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Oasis Education Centre will be within two years. </p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern/Te Waipounamu</p><p>19 May 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
