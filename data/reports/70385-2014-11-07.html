</table><p>Cornerstone Christian Early Learning Centre Middleton is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Cornerstone Christian Early Learning Centre Middleton is a privately owned pre-school. It is managed by a Board of Management that also oversees another early learning centre, as well as a number of Christian Schools.</p><p>This is the first ERO report for the centre since it moved from Papanui to a new purpose built centre in Riccarton, Christchurch. It is located next to and has close links with the local Christian-based school. The centre has changed its licence to accommodate an increased roll of 50 children from two years to school age. It is open during the school terms. There is a new head teacher and several new staff.</p><p>Many families choose the preschool because of its Christian philosophy and moved with the centre when it relocated. Most children go on to attend schools with a similar Christian approach.</p><p>Children from a wide range of different cultures attend the centre, with a significant number of families from Asia contributing to the roll.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are encouraged in their learning by caring, respectful teaching staff. Interactions are positive and teachers are nurturing. They listen carefully and regularly praise children for making good choices.</p><p>The strong Christian influence is well documented and highly evident in planning and programmes. Staff are committed to the philosophy of the centre.</p><p>Parent involvement in the centre is valued. Teachers recognise parents as their child’s first teachers. They actively seek their views and work towards developing positive partnerships with parents. There is an increasing focus on seeking whānau voice to inform children’s assessment. Useful wall displays keep parents informed about aspects of the programme and centre operations.</p><p>The programme promotes good relationships through building children’s friendships and social skills. Teachers check on children’s understandings and reinforce earlier learning. Developing early literacy and mathematics skills is part of the programme. Children hear and learn some te reo Māori.</p><p>Teachers provide children with a range of learning experiences and interesting, accessible resources to support their learning. Learning areas are bright and inviting with the children’s work proudly displayed.</p><p>There is a growing awareness of acknowledging the cultures of families. Teachers are looking at different ways of supporting the wellbeing and communication needs of children whose first language is not English.</p><p>Teachers work well as a team. They are reflective and regularly discuss how to improve or adapt aspects of the programme. Teachers receive good quality feedback through appraisal.</p><p>The head teacher leads well-documented self review. A review of how to support children’s transition to school resulted in strengthening the centre's relationship with a local school. The management board is well informed by regular reports from the head teacher.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre has identified and ERO agrees, that a key next step is for teachers to more clearly show how <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum, is reflected in their programme planning, assessment and evaluation.</p><p>As a result of moving to a new centre the roll has increased from 30 children to 50 children. The head teacher acknowledges it would be timely for the centre to now review the impact of this on the way they organise the children’s daily routines and the structure of centre leadership.</p><p>Other next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>teachers focusing more on the specific ways they can extend children’s learning and evaluating the effectiveness of their teaching practices</li>
<li>strengthening self review by making more use of key documents, like <em>Te Whāriki</em>, and better evaluating the impact on children’s learning when changes are made to the programme as a result of self review</li>
<li>making the centre’s commitment to bicultural practice more prominent in the centre documents, programme and self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Cornerstone Christian Early Learning Centre Middleton completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Cornerstone Christian Early Learning Centre Middleton will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>7 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
