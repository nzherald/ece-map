</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Maungatapu Pre-School is located in the suburb of Maungatapu, Tauranga. The centre is licensed for 45 children, including 15 under two years of age. The centre has been open since 2010 and is privately owned. The current roll of 55 includes seven children who identify as Māori and eight from a range of cultural heritages. The majority of staff are qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>The centre philosophy promotes building a sense of community and children to develop a strong sense of belonging. Teachers and leaders are supportive of the Treaty of Waitangi and integrate te reo Māori into the daily programme. Since the last review there has been a focus on developing self review and greater parental involvement. There has been further development of the appraisal process and increasing teacher expectations about delivering quality care and learning for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Strong, responsive, reciprocal and respectful relationships are formed with each family, supporting children’s sense of belonging. Assessment, planning and evaluation are responsive to children’s emerging interests, strengths and needs. A feature of the centre is the high teacher-to-child ratio that allows for high levels of care and supervision. Teachers recognise the importance of play as a vehicle for learning. Children have easy access to an environment that is well resourced and encourages exploration, fosters children’s curiosity and encourages risk taking.</p><p>Teachers use a range of effective strategies to respond to all children. They value and encourage aspirations for children and the use of positive guidance practices are well embedded and consistently enacted. Nurturing and respectful interactions between teachers and children are highly evident with children’s independence and choice encouraged. Transition into, through and out of the centre is highly effective. A purposely planned approach is responsive to the individual child’s interests and readiness for learning in collaboration with whānau.</p><p>The service builds teacher capability to sustain and improve quality outcomes for children. Evidence of ongoing self review and planned inquiry have led to strengthening in teacher practice. Systems and procedures have been reviewed and refined to ensure children’s emotional and physical wellbeing. The appraisal system reflects the centre's direction with links to professional learning and development for teachers. This responds to teachers' professional needs and allows them to evaluate their practice and improve positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Leadership has built a highly positive and collaborative culture where leaders and teachers feel valued and respected. They embrace the unique position of te ao Māori with a high level of commitment to bicultural practice visible. Māori children benefit from this environment. Leaders and teachers ensure their practices reflect the rights of all children to a quality, inclusive early childhood education. Professional leadership opportunities are responsive to individual teachers' needs and areas of interest. Leaders are focused on improving the quality of education and care through ongoing systematic self review. Leaders strongly advocate for infants, toddlers and young children and their whānau.</p><p>Children under the age of two enjoy a calm and unhurried environment that provides the space and time for them to lead their learning.</p><p>There is a well-considered approach to supporting children with additional needs. Strong relationships with external agencies have been developed and this supports parents, whānau and children. Staff take full responsibility for the education and care of children with special learning needs, ensuring that they participate fully in all aspects of the programme alongside their peers. The centre has an inclusive and collaborative approach with centre-wide support.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Ongoing priority for the service is to review and align the philosophy to the expectations of <em>Te Whariki</em>. This should assist leaders and teachers to develop a shared understanding of the values and beliefs that underpin teaching and learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Maungatapu Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Maungatapu Pre-School will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>18 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
