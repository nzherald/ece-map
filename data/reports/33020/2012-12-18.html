<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Peachgrove Playcentre is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Peachgrove Playcentre is a family cooperative, early childhood service where parents and children learn alongside one another. The centre is located in central Hamilton and provides sessional education and care for children from birth to school age. It operates under the umbrella of the Waikato Playcentre Association and is affiliated to the New Zealand Playcentre Federation.</p><p>At the time of this ERO review the roll was 48, with 19 children under two years of age. The number of M&#257;ori families has recently increased and there are now 11 M&#257;ori children enrolled. The centre has sought advice and guidance from a recently employed kai&#257;whina, and a knowledgeable playcentre life member, to strengthen bicultural perspectives within the centre.</p><p>The centre philosophy emphasises child-initiated play with parents supporting and extending children&rsquo;s interests. Parents have made a commitment to further their own knowledge and learning, and a high proportion have completed course work.</p><p>Self review is effectively used to develop and improve centre practices and ensure sustainability. Children learn and play in a well presented, purpose-built centre surrounded by a spacious, natural outdoor environment.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in six early childhood education services within the Waikato Playcentre Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>The playcentre has a clearly articulated philosophy that is highly evident and effective in promoting positive outcomes for children and their families. Parents have established a strong culture of consultation that includes all families. Their strategic goals set a clear direction for centre development, are based on self review, and provide priority areas for further improvement.</p><p>Parents have responded positively to the recommendations in the 2009 ERO report related to assessment and bicultural practice. The centre was recently relicensed under the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008. The Waikato Playcentre Association provides useful guidance for administrative and operational advice, and an experienced centre support worker (CSW) visits regularly. Self review is highly effective, multi faceted and well-embedded.</p><p>Centre leaders give high priority to fostering emergent leadership in keeping with the playcentre philosophy, involving parents as learners. They have clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and there are good levels of qualifications and enthusiasm for ongoing professional learning and development. Experienced parents model good practice and support newer parents. They frequently reflect on their children&rsquo;s learning, share ideas and use their strengths to enhance outcomes for the children in their care.</p><p>Children and parents have a strong sense of belonging and contribute to learning and play in the centre. Children are developing leadership and confidence in choosing resources and managing their learning. Older children have the opportunity to learn and play in a morning session targeted to their specific needs and interests. Strong tuakana-teina relationships were evident in the mixed-age sessions. Celebrations and milestones are woven into the programme throughout the year. Portfolios are based on observations, capture the child&rsquo;s voice, and record children&rsquo;s interests, progress and development. Parents could now enhance their high-quality practices by further enriching the learning areas and making resources and equipment more visible and accessible for children.</p><p>Relationships amongst children and adults are loving and reciprocal. Adults are responsive to children&rsquo;s interests, recognise strengths, affirm children&rsquo;s contributions, and give time to listen. Literacy and mathematics concepts are woven holistically into play through resources, conversations, singing and storytelling. Parents use open questions and rich vocabulary to support children to develop their thinking and problem solving skills. Children transition through the sessions and on to school as graduates, in a smooth and planned way. Parents use positive strategies to manage children&rsquo;s behaviour, including those children with special needs.</p><p>The centre has well-established guidelines and documentation to guide practice. Members could consider, as they review their policies and procedures, simplifying the documentation and reporting of centre activities to ensure that systems remain clear and sustainable for all members.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Peachgrove Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>18 December 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
