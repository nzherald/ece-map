<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Children at Reid Park Kindergarten play and learn in a recently renovated and well-resourced environment. The teachers provide a high quality programme. The kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for its children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Reid Park Kindergarten is a community-based kindergarten. Since its 2009 Education Review, there have been some staff changes, including the recent appointment of a new head teacher. The families and the committee are very supportive. The kindergarten provides sessional and full-day programmes for children aged two to five years.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in eight early childhood education services within the Dunedin Kindergarten (DK) umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>The teachers have very good relationships with the children. They know them and their families well. The children play well together and have strong friendships with each other. On the day of the review they were very involved and sustained in their play.</p><p>The teachers use the children&rsquo;s strengths and interests as the starting point for group programmes which develop and grow over many learning areas. The children hear and use te reo M&#257;ori and teachers have effectively integrated M&#257;ori perspectives into the programme. Records of group planning make it very clear what the children have learnt and what the teachers have done to extend and support their learning.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s learning is further supported by:</p><ul>
<li>the rich range of resources and a purposefully set out learning environment</li>
<li>teachers who use high quality conversations to challenge and extend children&rsquo;s thinking</li>
<li>regular group music and movement sessions</li>
<li>effective integration of early literacy and numeracy</li>
<li>the way teachers contribute their own interests and passions to the programme, such as sustainability and gardening.</li>
</ul><p>The teaching team has developed shared roles and responsibilities and are an effective team. They are well supported by the senior teachers of the DK and receive good support from them for ongoing professional learning to improve outcomes for children. The DK managers and governors have a clear strategic direction and sound policy framework to support the kindergarten.</p><h3>Area for development and review</h3><p>The teachers identified that self review is still in the early stages of development. The next step is for them to:</p><ul>
<li>develop and implement a schedule of review to cover key aspects of their programme and practices over time.</li>
<li>ERO note several areas where teachers could use self review to refine and improve aspects of their practice. These areas include reviewing:</li>
<li>as a new team, reviewing centre philosophy and consolidating team approaches to teaching and learning</li>
<li>how they record and make clear teaching strategies to support individual children&rsquo;s learning priorities.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Reid Park Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select &lsquo;have&rsquo; or &lsquo;have not&rsquo; taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>3 September 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
