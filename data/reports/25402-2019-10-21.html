</table><p>The Playhouse Pre-School is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Playhouse Pre-School is a privately owned, purpose-built education and care service located in Pukekohe. The centre is licensed to provide all-day care for 40 children, including 15 up to the age of two years. At the time of this review there were 43 children enrolled.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is that 'early childhood should be fun; a time for mana aotūroa (exploration), discovery and active learning, where tamariki learn naturally through meaningful takaro (play) and social interactions'. The centre endeavours to create a pathway of learning for children.</p><p>Children learn in a mixed-age setting. The teaching team includes male and female staff. Almost all of the teachers hold a teaching qualification.</p><p>The centre owner forms part of the leadership team and is supported by a general manager. They manage a second early childhood centre that is located on the same street. The centre has a head teacher and two staff who have leadership roles for the different age groups.</p><p>The centre has responded very well to the June 2016 ERO report. The centre has: reviewed and developed their transition-to-school programme; strengthened assessment records to show children’s learning progress over time; and developed a centre-wide collaborative inquiry and evaluation process.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn in a calm and caring environment. Socialisation, friendships and collaboration between children are nurtured and tuakana teina relationships are encouraged through mixed-age play. Parents and children experience positive transitions into the centre. Well-established routines enable teachers to settle children under two in a separate area each day before they join the older children. Parents appreciate the warm relationships between teachers and children. Teachers are responsive to children who have English as a second language. Children’s sense of belonging and wellbeing is fostered.</p><p>Children participate in a broad range of learning experiences. Literacy and mathematics concepts are integrated naturally into play. A bush programme operates weekly for the 4-year old children and supports scientific exploration. The centre's transition-to-school programme has been significantly revised and now develops children's school readiness through a range of play-based learning opportunities. Tikanga Māori is integrated into daily routines and te reo Māori is used alongside English at mat time to introduce and revisit new learning. Centre leaders and teachers are reviewing play areas and resources as part of their strategic plan.</p><p>Effective systems support consistent and collaborative practices for the assessment, planning and evaluation of children’s learning. Teachers are responsive to children's dispositions and interests, and they provide opportunities to support children's progress through continuity of learning. Assessment portfolios are attractively presented and used by children to revisit their learning and develop early literacy skills. Teachers regularly write a learning evaluation for each child that is shared with parents and used to plan further learning opportunities for children. Children's strengths and interests are supported by responsive practices.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have developed reciprocal relationships with parents and the wider community. There are positive and trusting relationships between teachers and parents. A range of communication methods are used to share children's learning. Teachers gather and respond to parents' aspirations for their children and share learning strategies with parents to support children's development at home. Leaders and teachers have established useful relationships with several local schools as part of an evaluation of the centre's transition-to-school programme.</p><p>Centre leadership is effective. Useful systems promote consistent practice and shared understandings across the centre. A culture of strong relational trust and collaboration is evident. A systematic and comprehensive internal evaluation process supports ongoing review and improvement aligned to achieving strategic goals. A variety of targeted professional learning opportunities support teachers to grow their professional practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre's leaders and ERO agree that a useful next step is for leaders and teachers to continue to develop ways to enable children to lead their own learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Playhouse Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>21 October 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
