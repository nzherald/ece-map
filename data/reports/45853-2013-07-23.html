<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Dream Au Pair operates a highly effective recruitment and placement service for parents wanting home based care with au pair from countries other than New Zealand. Operation of the service is by a small management group. The service has moved from just recruitment, to placement, education and support for au pair.</p><p>Children enjoy warm and positive relationships with au pair. They engage enthusiastically with au pair in conversations about their play. Children have access to a good range of equipment and participate in playgroups and many excursions into the community.</p><p>Education coordinators support the au pair well. They visit homes regularly and model how to further engage children in play and write stories about children&rsquo;s learning. The coordinator ensures parents are kept well informed of children&rsquo;s participation and learning.</p><p>Purposeful self review guides service development and managers have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities. They have successfully developed strong pastoral care processes for au pair. Managers maintain effective links between au pair, coordinators and management.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Dream Au Pair works closely with agencies in Europe and other overseas countries to recruit and place au pair. Careful and thorough recruitment expectations are met before au pair are registered on an availability listing with Dream Au Pair. Applicants must provide evidence of their experience in working with young children. They are police vetted in their home country and reports from referees are provided. Parents wanting to access this service are carefully matched with au pair on the list. They are given choices about who they will employ. Au pair have choices about families they wish to work for including ages and numbers of children. Dream Au Pair coordinators visit parents&rsquo; homes prior to placements. They explain home-based care safety expectations, and carry out required checks.</p><p>Dream Au Pair undertakes an in-depth orientation with new au pair. This orientation includes a further NZ police vet, and training about the service&rsquo;s policies, procedures, philosophy and programme expectations. Parents also receive information about their responsibilities. Bi-monthly in-service and weekly playgroups run by the coordinators are provided for au pair. Monthly visits to homes by coordinators provide opportunities for au pair to share any questions they may have about their work with children.</p><p>The service at present has two networks that operate throughout Auckland. One network is provisionally registered. The other network was fully licensed in February 2013. This 2013 ERO report comments about the fully licensed network only. Five homes were visited as part of this review. Management, parents, au pair and education coordinators all contributed to the findings of this review.</p><h3>Areas of good performance</h3><p>Relationships between au pair and children in their care are warm and positive. Au pair are often selected by parents to support children to learn or strengthen a language other than English. Children are trusting and relaxed with au pair, who provide child-based programmes and activities that engage children. Children respond positively in conversations, talking freely with both coordinators and au pair during visits. They make choices about their play.</p><p>Children receive regular opportunities outside their homes as part of their care. In addition to the Dream Au Pair play groups, au pair frequently take children to library story times, music groups and informal playgroups organised in homes. Outings to local parks and playgrounds are also regular events for children. The coordinators organise a monthly educational visit for all children and au pair within Auckland. Learning stories and photographs of such events are posted on line to remind parents and children of these experiences.</p><p>Play environments are generally well supplied with children&rsquo;s own toys and books. Children have clearly designated and ample playing spaces. Au pair are supplied with art supplies by coordinators, who also bring interesting items to extend and support learning programmes. Children are generally able to play both indoors and outside.</p><p>Coordinators support au pair to regularly record individual learning stories, about children, that are closely linked to the aims and goals of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. These stories are also linked to what au pair know about children as learners. Parents also frequently contribute to learning stories with comments and information about their children. The close partnership between parents and au pair adds to the quality of provision for children.</p><h3>Quality of Management</h3><p>Management has developed comprehensive documentation to guide and support every aspect of their business. They have strong self review and processes aligned to strategic planning. These sound management systems and processes promote on-going good improvement over time.</p><p>Managers are committed to providing a high quality service. Appraisal of all staff, including management, is well established. It is closely aligned with the selection of professional development and the company strategic plan. Au pair spoken to during the review expressed their pleasure in the support they receive from Dream Au Pair.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>ERO and management agree that next steps are for the service to continue:</p><ul>
<li>developing a bicultural focus across all aspects of the service</li>
<li>considering ways of involving a group of parents as spokespersons representing the parent body for commenting about reviews</li>
<li>developing understanding of assessment, planning and evaluation.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Dream Au Pair completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
