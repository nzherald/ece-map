</table><p>Kindercare Learning Centres Tawa is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres Tawa is one of eight learning services in the Wellington region owned and operated by Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd (the organisation). The centre is licensed for 100 children, including 25 aged under two years. Of the total roll of 115, six children are Māori, and four are Pacific. Families represent a number of diverse cultures.</p><p>The purpose-built centre caters for children in age-specific rooms and outdoor spaces. The organisation provides policies, procedures and a framework to monitor health and safety. An area manager works in partnership with the centre director to support the operation of the centre.</p><p>The service philosophy is based on Kindercare’s three key values, ‘Safe, Loved and Learning.’</p><p>Since the April 2016 ERO report there has been significant turnover of staff and leadership. The previous ERO report identified areas requiring further development. This included assessment, planning and evaluation, internal evaluation practice, the bicultural curriculum, and responsiveness to Māori and Pacific families. Progress is ongoing in all these areas.</p><p>The review was one of five in Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd in Wellington.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Interactions between children and teachers are respectful and responsive. Teachers model positive attitudes and affirm learning dispositions such as persistence and confidence. They notice and support children’s interests. A good range of cultural celebrations extend the curriculum.</p><p>Infants and toddlers explore at their own pace in a suitably unhurried programme.</p><p>Teachers use positive strategies to effectively promote children’s social competence. Children with special learning and behaviour needs benefit from a useful, well-considered planning approach. Teachers proactively collaborate with relevant experts to support these learners.</p><p>Leaders acknowledge that culturally responsive practices need improvement. Professional learning, and strategic planning at governance level, are being put in place to support improvements. To improve outcomes for children, leaders and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>deepen their understanding of bicultural practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build their understanding, and implementation, of targeted and specific strategies that promote the success of tamariki Māori and Pacific children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>work in partnership with families to gather information about children’s diverse cultural contexts in order to enrich and individualise teaching strategies.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO and leaders agree that the service should continue to update and improve assessment, planning and evaluation practices. These should focus much more strongly on intentional teaching practices and clear evidence of improved learning outcomes. Some useful strategies to build understanding of and consistency in evaluation are in the beginning stages. Teachers should also ensure that assessment draws meaningfully on children’s unique cultures, languages and identities.</p><p>In consultation with whānau and community, leaders and teachers should establish localised valued learning priorities that reflect <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Clarifying what learning matters most, should support consistency and deliberate actions within the programme, and in assessment, planning and evaluation practices.</p><p>Teachers are reflective and engage with readings and professional learning to grow their understanding in useful areas. However, internal evaluation and teacher inquiry continues to require development. Leaders and teachers should focus evaluations and inquiries on impacts for children. By focusing on outcomes teachers would be better able to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives, practices and improvements.</p><p>The organisation has established systems to support the professional learning and development of teachers. There is a clear focus on building leadership. To better promote positive outcomes for children, the implementation and consistency of appraisal and mentoring processes should be improved.</p><p>A next step for the organisation is to evaluate how consistently leaders, including managers and centre directors, build teachers’ capability and improve practice. To better promote timely improvements feedback at all levels should be more strongly focused on constructive critique, meaningful challenge, and evidence of teaching and learning progress.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At service level, priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establish priority learning outcomes, in collaboration with families and community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement and deepen the understanding of the bicultural curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build understandings and practices to better promote success for Māori and Pacific children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve the quality of assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop internal evaluation and teacher inquiry to focus on outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The organisation should continue to strengthen and embed:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>their reflection of the principles of The Treaty of Waitangi in guiding documents and teacher practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluation of effectiveness at leadership, management and governance level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>alignment of strategic planning, internal evaluation and reporting.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The organisation needs to strengthen the effectiveness of leaders in building teachers’ capability and improving practice. Attention should be paid to ensuring the key next steps identified in this service’s ERO report are addressed.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres Tawa completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice, broaden the assessment and management of risks for excursions off-premises<em>.</em></p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>24 September 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
