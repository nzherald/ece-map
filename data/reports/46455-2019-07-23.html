</table><p>Iqra Educare&nbsp;is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Iqra Educare is an education and care service located on the same premises as Jamia Mashid Mosque in the suburb of Claudelands in Hamilton. The centre is licensed for 30 children over the age of two years in a full-day programme. The current roll of 30 includes children from diverse ethnic backgrounds including 17 of Somalian descent. Many children have English as a second language.</p><p>The centre is governed by a board operating on behalf of the Waikato Muslim Association (WMA). Board members have a range of relevant skills and experience to enable them to effectively govern the centre. The board sets the direction for the centre and an experienced head teacher provides professional leadership for teachers.</p><p>The centre's philosophy makes a commitment to provide holistic care for each individual and a high standard of education for the children of the community, based on Islamic beliefs and values. The service encourages every child to develop knowledge of the wider world, self-help skills and positive dispositions.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in February 2016 a new centre manager has been appointed from the teaching team and there have been some changes to the teaching staff. The areas of strength identified in the 2016 report remain highly evident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Iqra Educare's philosophy and vision effectively underpin all aspects of centre operations.</p><p>Children experience a curriculum where they are encouraged to become confident and successful learners. Their language, culture and identity are highly visible and valued. The purpose-built learning environment is spacious and well resourced. Literacy, mathematics and science are naturally integrated throughout the programme. The centre has established strong partnerships with a wide range of external agencies to support migrant families for whom English is an additional language. Transitions are well considered into and beyond the centre. Children with additional needs are well supported through individualised planning and responsive practice. Children are supported to build their knowledge about New Zealand&rsquo;s unique cultural heritage through the frequent use of te reo M&#257;ori, waiata and centre&rsquo;s pepeha.</p><p>Highly-inclusive teaching practices are evident. Teachers know children and families very well. Children&rsquo;s social competence is well supported through positive and consistent guidance strategies. Teachers actively participate alongside children in meaningful play. They provide children with resources and activities for play. Increasing children's independent access to a wider range of resources and equipment as an important consideration for teachers. Teachers implement a range of strategies to support children who are new English language learners. Respectful and affirming relationships promote a strong sense of belonging for children and their families. Children's group learning experiences are documented and well presented in each child's learning portfolio.</p><p>Leaders promote a strong culture of teaching and learning. The head teacher provides regular feedback and feed forward to teachers to guide and improve practice. She models effective teaching practices for teachers. Leaders have established useful relationships with other organisations including participating in a two year Waikato University research project about supporting migrant families. A useful self-review process has been implemented. Self review could be further enhanced by more specifically focusing on learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The board provides supportive governance for the centre. The clearly defined vision and values successfully promote positive outcomes for children&rsquo;s learning and wellbeing, and that of their wh&#257;nau. The WMA has developed a comprehensive 20 year strategic plan which includes the opening of a second centre. Regular meaningful communication and consultation with wh&#257;nau enables the centre to respond effectively to parents' aspirations and needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next step for leaders and teachers is to strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation process. Consideration should be given to focusing on each individual child's learning and development including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>incorporating the learning outcomes from <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing planned responses to parents' aspirations.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Iqra Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>23 July 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <i>ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on ERO&rsquo;s website.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
