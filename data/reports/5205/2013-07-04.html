</table><p>Central Kids Kindergartens – Waipahihi is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Waipahihi is located in the suburb of Richmond Heights, Taupo, adjacent to Waipahihi School within the rohe o Ngāti Tuwharetoa It is licensed for a maximum of 40 children over the age of two. The kindergarten’s current roll is 43. Of the 21 children who are identified as Māori a significant number whakapapa to Ngāti Tuwharatoa. It provides education and care for children from 8.45am to 2.45pm daily. In 2012 the kindergarten was relicensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>. The kindergarten operates under the umbrella organisation Central North Island Kindergarten Trust (known as Central Kids).</p><p>The kindergarten’s philosophy places high priority on establishing close and respectful relationships with children and their whānau. It states a commitment to developing a sense of whānaungatanga and partnership with parents, family, and whānau, and recognises the important place of tangata whenua.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review, membership of the teaching team has remained stable. Teachers’ participation in the Ngāti Tuwharetoa Cultural Knowledge Project during 2010 to 2012 has led to a significant increase in their understanding of Tuwharetoa tikanga. This professional learning has also supported teachers to continue to implement a bicultural curriculum and to promote an inclusive service for Māori whānau.</p><p>The kindergarten has responded positively to the areas identified for development in the 2010 ERO report.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 13 reviews in the Central Kids umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten’s curriculum is effectively designed and focused on promoting positive learning outcomes for children. The programme is responsive to children’s emerging interests and promotes learning through a play-based approach. Current programme priorities include:</p><ul>
<li>the provision of a strong Te Ao Māori dimension that is integrated into the programme</li>
<li>the natural integration of literacy, mathematics, science, computer technology and creativity</li>
<li>opportunities for children to develop their skills and understanding of how to learn and play cooperatively with peers</li>
<li>regular excursions into the wider community.</li>
</ul><p>ERO observed many examples of children engaged in meaningful and sustained play. Teachers skilfully involved themselves alongside children to extend and add complexity to play. They support and affirm the special talents of children with diverse needs. Children experience a calm, settled, and well-resourced environment where they are able to play independently, make decisions, and learn from each other. Māori tamariki and their whānau experience a strong sense of cultural identity and belonging in the kindergarten.</p><p>The knowledgeable and committed head teacher has led a successful focus on strengthening the quality of education and care that children and their families’ experience. She skilfully works alongside teachers, whānau and children to empower them to take responsibility for learning. The head teacher has established comprehensive systems, including focused and meaningful self review that contributes to a strong culture for continued improvement and ongoing sustainability.</p><p>Teachers work cooperatively to reflect on their practice and engage in meaningful conversations to enrich children’s experiences. They effectively document children’s learning in well presented and easily accessible individual profiles. These profiles reflect the learning partnerships that exist between children, teachers and whānau. Teachers are continuing to review and refine their assessment and planning practices.</p><p>The kindergarten continues to receive good quality support from Central Kids. The newly appointed Central Kids professional leader has established a positive and supportive relationship with the head teacher and staff. Comprehensive policy guidelines assist staff to meet regulatory requirements and Central Kids’ high standards and expectations.</p><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the effectiveness of the kindergarten’s responsibilities for employment and management of staff. Central Kids have developed and implemented highly effective processes to appoint and support staff at the kindergarten.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the key next step is to further develop the consistent use of high-quality teaching practices that promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Waipahihi completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Waipahihi will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>4 July 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
