<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Harinui Early Childhood Learning Centre is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Harinui Early Childhood Learning Centre is a well established service on a spacious semi-rural property in Kerikeri. The centre caters for children under three years old and has the capacity to provide a dedicated space for infants. It operates in conjunction with the adjacent Arohanui Early Childhood Learning Centre for older children.</p><p>The centre has a very positive reporting history with ERO and continues to provide a rich programme that reflects aspects of the Magda Gerber philosophy and <em>Te Whariki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. The centre philosophy also identifies a focus on promoting community care for the natural environment and a commitment to honouring the Tiriti o Waitangi. The experienced centre owner leads a team of well qualified and long serving staff.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident explorers. They are trusted to make their own choices and have established genuine friendships with teachers and their peers. They are becoming competent communicators and confidently articulate their interests and needs to adults. Well established routines and centre organisation establishes predictability for children that supports their sense of wellbeing and belonging. As a result, the centre provides a sound emotional environment for children.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to the needs and interests of children. They recognise the importance of consistency and continuity in the care and education of young children. Primary caregivers for individual children contribute to the secure foundation for children&rsquo;s development and easy transitions within the centre. Adults trust children to develop as independent learners. They provide a calm slow pace that allows infants and toddlers the appropriate time and space to lead their own learning.</p><p>Teachers develop programmes that focus on children&rsquo;s dispositions as learners. They design relevant learning experiences that encourage children to explore and make their own discoveries. Programmes provide opportunities for children to become familiar with te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori. Teachers can enhance this provision by displaying te reo words and phrases at children&rsquo;s level to encourage adults to use these prompts with children.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s assessment portfolios celebrate children&rsquo;s milestones. They contain good information for parents about children&rsquo;s care and learning dispositions. Attractive photos capture children&rsquo;s engagement in the programme very well. Teachers have identified the need to provide more space for parent contributions in the portfolios. Children would also benefit from better independent access to their portfolios so they can revisit special moments in their learning.</p><p>The centre owner leads a culturally diverse teaching team effectively. She has established thoughtful and considerate employment practices. As a result there is a low turnover of staff. Teachers enthusiastically commit to professional development and have created a culture where children are valued, celebrated and affirmed.</p><p>The leadership team deliberately encourage parents&rsquo; involvement in the centre. They have established several events and opportunities for parents to be actively engaged in their children&rsquo;s learning. These events foster parent participation in the centre&rsquo;s self review and enable them to make meaningful contributions to centre decision making. Parents and staff value the consultative self review processes.</p><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that the next priority for centre development is to strengthen the programme planning documentation. More specific documentation would provide a basis for teachers to more formally evaluate the impact of teacher practice on the quality of children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>While teachers record information about children&rsquo;s learning dispositions very well they could now display programme information to better inform parents of the learning focus and related activities. Such a display would also prompt teachers to focus on identified learning priorities and guide their interactions with children.</p><p>Centre leaders recognise that a review of their strategic plan would help them to clarify future centre development and monitor progress towards centre goals.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Harinui Early Childhood Learning Centre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>25 March 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
