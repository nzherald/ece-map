</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Peacocks Early Learning Centre Epsom is a new service licensed to provide full-day education and care for 60 children, including up to 15 under two years old. Children learn in three age-related groups, although the two older groups frequently mix in a shared outdoor environment. The roll includes children from a variety of ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>The centre is part of the Peacock group of centres operated by a board of directors. They delegate daily management to a manager and a team leader but maintain close oversight of centre operations. Experienced mentors support staff with business and financial matters and curriculum delivery. The directors have established a clear strategic vision and policy framework, and they support the ongoing professional development of staff. The service has a strong commitment to the Reggio Emilia approach aligned with the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum. The RIE teaching philosophy also inspires pedagogy and practice with infants and toddlers.<i>Te Whāriki,</i></p><p>The teaching team includes seven registered teachers and several supporting staff. Teachers reflect the diversity of the centre community.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and relaxed in the centre. They have positive and respectful relationships with teachers and confidently explore resources that interest them. Children often play collaboratively in small groups, at times using first languages and they respond positively to adult support. They benefit from many excursions into the community, the focus on nature education and a physical play programme that supplements their outdoor play opportunities. Children's independence is fostered through many opportunities to make choices and develop self-help skills.</p><p>Attractive indoor spaces encourage children to engage with natural materials and abstract resources known as 'loose parts' that reflect the Reggio Emilia approach to teaching and learning. Other traditional early childhood resources are also available, although some of these could be more easily accessible for children.</p><p>Children in the infant area are supported well with gentle affectionate care. The RIE teaching philosophy and a key kaiako (teacher) for settling into the centre supports their wellbeing and sense of belonging. Capable teachers who respect these very young children enable them to explore independently, take learning risks and develop relationships with others. The fun these babies have with music, singing and tactile materials supports their oral language development and fosters sharing and group play. Children are also becoming familiar with te reo Māori and waiata.</p><p>Teachers in all areas know children well. Teachers are strongly committed to the learning approaches they promote. They support children to explore the open-ended resources and involve them in group activities such as gardening. Adults value children's ideas, record their comments, and encourage early literacy and numeracy learning in meaningful contexts. The diversity of the teaching team enables them to support the first languages of many children well. Teachers are also building their capacity to provide a bicultural curriculum and support the success of Māori children.</p><p>Teachers formally and informally discuss children's learning interests. They keep daily, weekly and monthly records of children's involvement in the programme and align these experiences with <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. A greater planning focus on children's individual interests and learning dispositions could help to extend the complexity of children's play. Teachers have identified the need to further develop their systems to support older children in their transition to school.</p><p>Parents are kept well informed about learning programmes. Frequent reports, surveys, newsletters, emails and opportunities to share their child's assessment portfolios enable parents to share aspirations and comment on learning. Families also contribute their skills and knowledge during cultural events and relevant learning topics. Parent surveys indicate there is considerable satisfaction with the service.</p><p>The centre is well managed. The directors and centre manager lead the operation of the centre efficiently through a sound policy framework and effective health and safety systems. They have developed a long-term strategic plan with an annual implementation process which they plan to evaluate and modify each year. Leaders have established internal evaluation processes. They ensure that there are links between teachers' appraisal goals, centre goals, professional development opportunities and evaluation topics. They could further develop their review of aspects of teaching and learning, and the ways in which these support children's holistic development. Directors have a strong commitment to the ongoing mentoring of staff to retain teachers and increase their capacity as leaders.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree the next steps for centre development include:</p><p>continuing to deepen internal evaluation processes</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop bicultural practices and establishing a relationship with the local marae</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing relationships with local schools to enhance transitions for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Peacocks Early Learning Centre Epsom completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Peacocks Early Learning Centre Epsom will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>12 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
