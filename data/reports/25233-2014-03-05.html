</table><p>Pakuranga-Rahihi Playcentre requires support to improve the quality of the programme and the management of the centre in order to better promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pakuranga-Rahihi Playcentre in East Auckland is run by parents/whānau. It caters for children up to six years of age and offers three general sessions each week. The centre is one of 16 playcentres in the Tamaki Playcentre Association, which provides a management and policy framework to guide centre operations.</p><p>Over the past two years the centre membership of Pakuranga-Rahihi Playcentre has been rebuilding and it is now looking stronger as 2013 comes to an end. For most of 2013 there have not been a sufficient number of adults with the required playcentre training certification to operate the playcentre sessions without paid support.</p><p>Since ERO’s 2010 review membership turnover, small rolls and the current low training levels of members have impacted negatively on the centre’s capacity to sustain many of the systems needed to run the Playcentre effectively. The current group of adults at the centre is enthusiastic about making the improvements needed, with some initiatives already underway.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six playcentre reviews in the Tamaki Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive relationships between adults and with children are evident. Children communicate their needs and adults are responsive to their requests. Most of the children currently attending are between 1-3 years of age, with a growing number of new babies. Children are very active in their play and exploration. Adults encourage children to develop their self-management skills and independence. A large secure area for young babies would help adults to provide a programme that meets the needs of their youngest members.</p><p>The current low level of adult training impacts on the quality of the programme. While adults provide a good range of activities for children to engage with, they largely supervise children rather than involving themselves in children’s play. The group would benefit from some modelling and guidance to help strengthen their understanding of their role in supporting children’s learning and development.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation are at an early stage. There are a few examples of good quality assessment of children’s learning, but most records are descriptive and do not recognise the learning that has occurred. The lack of a regular planning meeting means that adults are not well prepared to deliver an educational programme.</p><p>The centre requires work to address the poor acoustics caused by the building design. In addition, the general upkeep of the environment and resourcing levels are not being maintained. Plans are in place to refresh the environment and upgrade the equipment and acting on these plans should be a centre priority.</p><p>Self review is not formally undertaken. Self review is a requirement of all centres to help monitor how well they meet requirements and to guide improvements to practice. More active, targeted support from the Association, and from other agencies where required, is essential to help the playcentre re-establish effective practices, improve the programme, and maintain membership levels and numbers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members and ERO agree that next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>increase the overall training levels of adults in the centre</li>
<li>improve adults’ knowledge of how to foster children’s learning and development</li>
<li>improve adults’ understanding of effective assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>improve the quality of the physical environment</li>
<li>increase the quantity of suitable play equipment for children</li>
<li>develop and implement systems for self review.</li>
</ul><p>ERO has confidence that, with the right support, the Pakuranga-Rahihi Playcentre members will be able to establish and sustain practices that help them to better promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Tamaki Playcentre Association Information</h3><p>The cluster review of six playcentres within the Tamaki Playcentre Association has identified areas of governance and management for the Association to address. These include:</p><ul>
<li>re-establishing performance management systems for all employed staff</li>
<li>documenting strategic and annual planning systems for the Association as a whole</li>
<li>clearly documenting a cycle of review and evaluation to support ongoing development and improvement at the Association level.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pakuranga-Rahihi Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3><span>Actions for compliance</span></h3><p>During the review ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum and self review. To meet requirements Pakuranga-Rahihi Playcentre needs to:</p><ul>
<li>ensure that the curriculum is informed by assessment, planning and evaluation that demonstrates an understanding of children’s learning and interests</li>
<li>implement an ongoing process of self review to help maintain and improve the quality of education and care.<em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C2, GMA6.</em></li>
</ul><h4>Development Plan Recommendation</h4><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pakuranga-Rahihi Playcentre will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>5 March 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
