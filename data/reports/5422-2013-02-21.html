<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Hei Hei is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens administers 62 kindergartens and one early learning centre in Canterbury and the West Coast. An education services manager works with each kindergarten giving feedback and professional support. Families from a diverse range of cultures attend this kindergarten.</p><p>Since the May 2009 ERO review this kindergarten has changed its operating hours and had some changes in teaching and support staff. The long serving head teacher has provided continuity during these changes. There are strong links with parents and families, including parents who have previously attended the kindergarten.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in nine kindergartens within the Kidsfirst Kindergartens umbrella organisation</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers give priority to supporting children and their families. They build effective relationships with parents by regularly sharing information and providing additional support when needed. Parents are having increasing opportunities to contribute to decisions about the programme and childrens' learning.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s confidence, and especially sense of belonging in the kindergarten, is actively fostered in an inclusive environment for children with diverse learning strengths and needs.</p><p>Teachers:</p><ul>
<li>are welcoming, sensitive and caring towards children and their families</li>
<li>have fun with children</li>
<li>make good use of conversations with children to learn more about their lives</li>
<li>recognise and celebrate children&rsquo;s achievements.</li>
</ul><p>Children:</p><ul>
<li>are friendly, curious and confident learners</li>
<li>play happily alone and together and are increasingly learning the skills for successfully managing their relationships with each other.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers use a range of effective ways to promote children&rsquo;s learning. These approaches include:</p><ul>
<li>encouraging children to solve their own problems</li>
<li>asking questions that help children explain and expand on their ideas</li>
<li>making suggestions and modelling different ways to use resources</li>
<li>giving children good opportunities to make decisions and take the lead in their play.</li>
</ul><p>Positive features of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>a good range of accessible resources to motivate children to develop their interests and inquiry</li>
<li>developing children&rsquo;s awareness and understanding of science and the natural world</li>
<li>recognition of the M&#257;ori culture and other children&rsquo;s cultural backgrounds</li>
<li>the regular use of visitors from the wider community to extend children&rsquo;s learning experiences.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have recently made some changes to improve the way they plan the programme. They are now more focused on identifying what children could learn and how they will support this. Parents and children have more opportunities to say what learning activities they would like included in the programme. Wall displays show children&rsquo;s involvement in the programme making this more clearly known to the children and parents.</p><p>The teachers with support from the ESM make good use of appropriate professional development to extend their knowledge and teaching expertise. The head teacher is suitably focused on supporting ongoing improvements to the programme and practices. Teachers use team discussions effectively to consider ways to improve the programme. They receive specific and useful feedback from the education service manager (ESM). Aspects of self review have been strengthened.</p><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Association has a well developed policy and practice framework to support the daily and long term operation of the kindergarten. The association is kept well informed about the work of the kindergarten by the ESM and head teacher. Kidsfirst managers have recently developed a new process for reviewing and reporting kindergarten information. This process is likely to help them further target their support to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>Teachers and the ESM have reliably identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps are to strengthen and build on recent initiatives in planning, assessment and self review.</p><p>Teachers are in the early stages of changing planning practices. Planning could be improved by:</p><p>making clearer links between planning and children&rsquo;s assessment information</p><p>developing a process to evaluate the success of teaching strategies and outcomes for children.</p><p>The next steps for assessment are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop greater consistency in the way teachers assess children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>make clearer the next steps for children&rsquo;s learning and teaching strategies to support these</li>
<li>make sure teachers are revisiting children&rsquo;s learning and showing their progress over time</li>
<li>ensure profile books have a better balance between stories about individual children&rsquo;s learning and programme events</li>
<li>show how parents' aspirations are responded to in planning and assessment.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are developing a better understanding of self review. They now need to use this learning to successfully complete and document the impact of any changes they have made as a result of self review against their goals.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Hei Hei completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they select &lsquo;have&rsquo; or &lsquo;have not&rsquo; taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.Click here to enter text.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>21 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
