</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids Inn Preschool is licensed to provide all day education and care for up to 45 children aged over two years. The service operates from a converted house opposite Kids Inn Nursery and Fantails. Children transition into this centre aged approximately three and a half years.</p><p>In December 2014 the service changed ownership and is now under the governance and management of Evolve Group 3 Ltd. A manager is responsible for the running of the centre and leads a team of five other qualified teachers, and one unqualified teacher. The cultural diversity of the community is reflected in the teaching team.</p><p>The philosophy of the service is underpinned by <em>Te Whariki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and states the team's commitment to honouring the Treaty of Waitangi. The setting of an environment that is supportive, nurturing, and stimulating is seen as an important foundation in empowering children to become competent and capable learners. The Reggio Emilia philosophy influences the programme and the environment.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report noted that children were happy and settled, and enjoyed positive relationships with teachers. The reported commended the teachers' presentation of an attractive, stimulating environment. Successful processes for teacher development and self review had improved learning outcomes for children. These positive aspects are still evident.</p><p>Areas identified for ongoing development in the 2013 report were the portfolios of children's learning, teachers' responsiveness to parent aspirations and the language, culture and identity of all children, and bicultural practice. It was also suggested that teachers review programme routines. There have been positive developments in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy is highly evident in practice. Children settle well and engage themselves in the programme. They independently access carefully selected resources that allow them to engage in play using real utensils. They are confident and capable. Children know centre routines well.</p><p>Indoor and outdoor environments encourage wondering, critical thought and creativity. Teachers' understanding of the importance of play as a vehicle for learning is highly evident. Children's conversations and discussions encouraged, accepted and valued.</p><p>Teachers' relationships with children are sensitive, positive and responsive. They plan a programme based on observations of children's interests. Teachers take time to focus on listening to children and exploring the deeper meaning in conversations, and children's wonderings. They support children to research, and explore their own working theories about their views on life.</p><p>Some teachers converse with children in their home languages, supporting their sense of belonging and wellbeing. Te reo and tikanga Māori are evident in centre routines and some incidental conversations.</p><p>The programme moves at a considered pace to ensure children's continued involvement and provide opportunities for children to revisit, and possibly extend, their learning. Children are encouraged to actively care for themselves and others, centre pets, and their world. Literacy, mathematics, and learning about the natural world are included meaningfully in the context of children's play.</p><p>Parents who spoke with ERO expressed satisfaction with the service. In particular they felt well informed about their child's learning, centre events and developments. Flexible processes ensured successful transitions for individual children, and consistency in teaching teams supported children's wellbeing.</p><p>The centre is well managed. New owners continue to review and adapt management systems. The policy framework that guides centre practices is also being reviewed and refined to align with current legislation.</p><p>Teacher appraisal processes are robust. Managers provide numerous opportunities for teachers to attend professional learning opportunities. There is good support for leaders, and an organisational culture that supports ongoing improvement. Good strategic recruitments have been made to support improved programmes and quality outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that to enhance their current good practice teachers should strengthen their bicultural practice by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increasing their use of te reo Māori throughout the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepening their knowledge of te ao Māori and making this visible in centre programmes and documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids Inn Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids Inn Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>4 October 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
