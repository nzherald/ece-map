</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Titiro Whakamua - Looking Forward Early Childhood Centre is part of the Hutt Valley Teen Parent programme and is situated in the grounds of Heretaunga College. The centre caters for teenage mothers and their children from Wainuiomata to Kaitoke. Mothers study in an adjoining classroom with easy access to their children.</p><p>The service is licensed for 30 children, including 25 up to two years of age. One third of the roll is Māori. At the time of this ERO review seventeen of the twenty children enrolled were aged up to two years. The three age groups, babies, toddlers and over twos, each enjoy their own area of the centre.</p><p>The head teacher is responsible for the day-to-day running of the centre. An incorporated society, made up of members from the community and school, governs the centre.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have begun to address the areas for development and review identified in the April 2015, ERO report. These included: strengthening strategic planning; self review and appraisal. Progress in these areas continues to be needed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy and vision are highly evident in practice. Whanaungatanga underpins centre relationships that are warm and friendly. Babies, infants, toddlers and their mothers are valued and their mana respected. They demonstrate a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging within an inclusive environment.</p><p>The holistic development of babies, infants and toddlers is fostered by teachers who know and respect mothers' routines and dreams for their children's future. Teachers recognise and respond appropriately to their interests and physical needs. Attentive adults listen, observe and respond to toddlers' and babies' gestures and expressive body language.</p><p>Attractive portfolios provide a rich record of children's learning and time at the centre. Strengths, interests, dispositions, cultural identities and needs are recognised and celebrated. Planning for learning is shared and parent input valued.</p><p>Aesthetic natural spaces, indoors and out, stimulate interest and encourage active exploration. Babies and toddlers enjoy freedom of movement in their own areas as they develop a strong sense of self, growing and learning at their own pace.</p><p>Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are highly evident and respected throughout the curriculum and centre environment. Māori children are authentically immersed in their culture. All children are supported to develop a positive understanding of their heritage.</p><p>A strong transition process supports both mother and child to settle into the centre and form positive relationships with centre staff. Their needs and circumstances are sensitively considered.</p><p>The centre's appraisal policy and processes need to align to Education Council’s expectations and Teacher Standards. The centre has developed an appraisal system based on how teachers meet the key areas identified in the centre's strategic plan. Teachers reflect on and record a range of evidence in their portfolios. These reflections can relate to practising teacher certification, but there is no direct link. Leaders have begun to explore the Education Council’s standards but have not documented how these will be included in teachers’ appraisals.</p><p>Annual and strategic plans guide improvements to the centre. ERO identified, and leaders agree, this planning should be strengthened to better guide implementation of planned changes.</p><p>Self review is reflective. ERO's evaluation identified, and leaders agree, that they should build their capability and understanding of internal evaluation. This should help them to better understand the impact of their practices and changes on outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified the need for leaders and staff to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>immediately review the centre’s appraisal system to incorporate Teacher Standards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen annual and strategic planning to guide centre developments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop an understanding of internal evaluation in order to enhance teaching and learning and positive outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Titiro Whakamua - Looking Forward Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance in the service related to appraisal.</p><p>The service provider must ensure that all teachers, including the head teacher, are regularly appraised.<br> <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7]</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Titiro Whakamua - Looking Forward Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>24 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
