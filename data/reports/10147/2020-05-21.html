</table><p>Fa'amasani Aoga Amata is not well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fa'amasani Aoga Amata is a full immersion Samoan language centre located on the grounds of the Massey Congregational Church of Samoa. The centre manager and head teacher are both experienced teachers. Most of the teachers are qualified and are fluent speakers of gagana Samoa (Samoan language). The service is governed by the Fa'amasani Trust.</p><p>The centre's philosophy promotes Christian and Samoan values through gagana Samoa and aganu'u Samoa (Samoan culture). Teachers seek to support children's language, culture and identity. Infants and toddlers have a separate indoor play area and are often involved in mixed play with the older children.</p><p>ERO's 2016 report highlighted a need to develop a child-centred and challenging curriculum and to implement teacher appraisal systems, internal evaluation processes, policy review and effective financial management. Compliance issues identified in the previous report have not been addressed. The centre has not made sufficient improvement in all of these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a basic programme based on <em><span lang="mi">Te Whāriki </span></em>, the early childhood curriculum. They have a strong sense of belonging and are involved in activities throughout the day. They choose from a range of activities set up by teachers and have good access to the outdoor learning environment.</p><p>Children are keen to engage with their peers and with adults. They are familiar with centre routines and actively participate in them. Teachers' interactions with children are positive and supportive. Teachers could improve their understanding and use of effective teaching strategies that promote children's learning. The curriculum should be more responsive to children's individual interests and challenge them as capable and confident learners.</p><p>Children with additional needs are supported. Infants and toddlers are integrated within the learning programme and on occasion they enjoy the support of older children. Children would benefit from teachers' participation in professional learning for effective programmes for children up to two years of age.</p><p>Teachers model gagana Samoa and encourage its use by children during routines and activities. Children participate well in singing pese Samoa (Samoan songs) during group times. They also celebrate aspects of fa'a Samoa (Samoan customs) during events and activities.</p><p>Children's learning records provide parents with regular, visual information about their child's participation in the programme. Teachers could now document children's interests and dispositions, and children's learning over time. Teachers are welcoming and approachable in their interactions with whānau/aiga. Parents appreciate the support of teachers in the inclusive, family friendly environment.</p><p>Centre leaders need to implement an effective appraisal process that incorporates the required Teaching Council Standards. There should be a focus on supporting teachers to develop specific teaching strategies to better support children's learning.</p><p>Internal evaluation processes designed to improve the curriculum are established. Teachers now need to extend these processes and evaluate other key areas of operations such as the service's annual and long-term plans.</p><p>Centre leaders need to participate in governance training and ensure financial management practices prioritise children's health and safety and learning. Currently, funds are not prioritised for improving the curriculum and environment provided for children. ERO identified a range of health and safety issues relating to the indoor and outdoor learning environments. This indicates a need for centre leaders, teachers and the management committee to commit further to ensuring children's physical wellbeing.</p><p>The centre's policy framework does not meet all licensing requirements. The Trust should ensure policies are regularly reviewed.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fa'amasani Aoga Amata completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service relating to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a service curriculum that is informed by assessment, planning and evaluation that demonstrates an understanding of children’s learning, their interests, whānau/aiga, and life contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the checking of equipment, premises and facilities every day of operation so that hazards to children's safety are eliminated, isolated or minimised</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consideration of hazards must include, but is not limited, to cleaning agents, medicines, poisons, and other hazardous materials; hazards present in laundry facilities; the condition and placement of learning, play and other equipment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>outdoor activity space is safe, and suitably surfaced for a variety of activities, enclosed by structures and/or fences and gates designed to ensure that children are not able to leave the premises without the knowledge of adults providing education and care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>toilet facilities intended for use by children are designed and located to allow children capable of independent toileting to access them safely without adult help</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>furniture and items intended for children to sleep on (such as cots, beds, stretchers, or mattresses) are of a design to ensure their safety</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a system of regular appraisal aligned to Teaching Council requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that the child protection and appointments policies meet the requirements of the Children Act 2014</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an annual budget that includes professional development costs; equipment and material costs; and provision for operational costs and maintenance of the premises as appropriate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that the service is effectively governed and is managed in accordance with good management practices.</p>
</li>

ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>21 May 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
