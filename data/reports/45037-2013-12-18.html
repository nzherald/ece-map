</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Abacus Childcare is located in Taupō, near the central business district. It provides all-day education and care for children from birth to school age. The centre is licensed for up to 37 children, including 10 up to two years of age. At the time of this review 63 children were enrolled, 12 of whom are identified as being of Māori descent. The centre operates under the ownership and management of Kidicorp Ltd, a national early childhood education and care provider.</p><p>The centre philosophy expresses a belief in children as being confident, competent learners who learn best through play, exploration, problem solving, discovery and risk taking, within safe limits and boundaries. Programme planning is interest driven and child initiated, and the environment is vital to children's learning. Relationships with whānau are valued and integral to children’s learning. Inclusive practices, a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and seeking parents’ aspirations for their children are given priority.</p><p>A significant number of teachers’ own children attend the service. This contributes to a settled environment and strong sense of family. The service is able to retain experienced and valued staff members, which contributes to continuity of education for children and relationships with families.</p><p>Since ERO’s June 2010 review there have been significant changes to management and the teaching team. The centre employs a high level of suitably qualified teachers and staff undertaking training, and maintains a higher than expected number of teachers to work with children. In addition, the centre has made significant progress in developing its self-review practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Kidicorp Ltd provides strong and effective governance and management for Abacus Childcare. This is evident through the centre's clear vision, philosophy and strategic direction. Appropriate policies, useful frameworks, quality assurance and sound financial management support and guide centre sustainability and teachers’ practice. There is a consistent focus on promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The knowledgeable and experienced area manager advocates for children and their families. She provides valued professional leadership and support for the centre manager and teachers, through regular professional development, reporting and responsive feedback.</p><p>The recently appointed centre manager has effectively established a collaborative, child-centred, culture. She demonstrates particular abilities and strengths in:</p><ul>
<li>fostering distributive leadership to maximise collective skills of team members</li>
<li>promoting professional learning and development for herself and team members</li>
<li>role modelling professional leadership and ‘best’ teaching practice</li>
<li>ensuring provision of responsive and highly accessible resources that enhance the curriculum, learning experiences and children's wellbeing and belonging</li>
<li>implementing in depth self-review processes that are informed by current research and lead to ongoing improvement to centre operations and teaching practice.</li>
</ul><p>The Abacus Childcare curriculum is well designed and implemented to promote positive education and care for all children. Close and reciprocal relationships with parents and families are highly evident and contribute to a curriculum that is responsive to their aspirations. Significant features of the curriculum that motivate children of all age groups as learners include:</p><ul>
<li>the clear emphasis on literacy, mathematics, science, technology and use of information and communication technologies for research and learning</li>
<li>well-integrated routines that foster self awareness and independence</li>
<li>the natural and home-like environment that provokes children’s curiosity, exploration and discoveries</li>
<li>the many opportunities for children to make links with and explore the wider Taupo community and extend their experience and knowledge of the local environment</li>
<li>the ‘Be School Ready’ approach that is naturally integrated and based on <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and aligned to the key competencies in <em>The New Zealand Curriculum.</em></li>
</ul><p>Whānau involvement is encouraged and highly valued by teachers. Teachers in the infant and toddler area integrate te reo and tikanga Māori consistently and respectfully. Throughout the centre displays affirm individual children’s language, culture and identity. Māori children, in particular, are benefitting from the emphasis that teachers place on the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p><p>Children’s participation in the curriculum and learning is well documented in displays and individual portfolios. Children enjoy revisiting their learning and sharing their successes and experiences with others.</p><p>Teachers skilfully respond to, challenge and extend children’s learning. Children have significant opportunities to problem-solve, experiment, follow their interests and build on strengths.</p><p>Trusting and affirming relationships contribute to positive transitions from home and within the centre. This includes the attention, affection and nurture that children receive from their parents and other adults in the centre. Teachers place an emphasis on primary care and opportunities to give infants and toddlers full attention. These very young learners demonstrate high levels of confidence and independence as they learn alongside their highly attuned and dedicated teachers.</p><p>Teachers are highly reflective practitioners who enthusiastically engage in their own ongoing learning and development. These opportunities contribute to teachers’ knowledge and ability to design and implement a curriculum that is responsive to the interests, strengths and abilities of infants, toddlers and young children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the area manager and centre manager agree that it is important for centre leaders and teachers to continue to build their awareness and capability in relation to bicultural practices. Important considerations include:</p><ul>
<li>embedding bicultural practices through strategic plans and self review</li>
<li>consulting and developing links with tangata whenua</li>
<li>strengthening the role of children in taking care of the environment</li>
<li>deepening teachers’ response to parent aspirations and children’s language, culture and identity.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Abacus Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Abacus Childcare will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>18 December 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
