<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>KidStart Invercargill South provides home-based care and education for children from birth to five years. All educators are experienced in supporting children&rsquo;s care and learning. The Invercargill South network is part of the Barnardos KidStart service. A recent reorganisation of the service has been well managed with no disruption to children&rsquo;s care and learning.</p><p>The business manager, new team leader and visiting teachers provide effective support for children&rsquo;s learning and care in educators&rsquo; homes. They share a common focus for promoting effective learning and teaching practices. The visiting teachers have quickly established positive working relationships with the educators, children and parents.</p><p>The home-based educators know the children in their care well. The children are settled and happy in educators&rsquo; homes. They are offered a range of individual and group learning experiences. This includes early literacy and numeracy, excursions with other educators and children, including Maori language and culture learning experiences.</p><p>The educators are well-supported with their work with the children. They have clear guidelines for ensuring a suitable environment for children's care and learning. The visiting teachers model effective practice and provide learning resources that suit the children&rsquo;s interests and needs.</p><p>The educators and visiting teachers make visually attractive records of children&rsquo;s experiences in the children&rsquo;s profile books. The visiting teacher is working with educators to improve how they plan for children's future learning.</p><p>A next step for managers, teachers and educators is to continue to develop a greater focus on children's learning and to review aspects of their systems to support this.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.Choose a future action statement.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The KidStart South reorganisation has resulted in new roles and responsibilities for many staff. All educators in the Invercargill South network are experienced in KidStart practices. A team leader supports the two visiting teachers in their work with educators and children. The service manager has overall responsibility for staff, operations and strategic direction.</p><h3>Areas of good performance</h3><p><em>Children&rsquo;s sense of belonging.</em> Children &lsquo;feel at home&rsquo; in educators' homes. Their educators know them well. As a result the children&rsquo;s routines are constantly being adapted to meet their individual needs. Children are engaged and extended through their daily play and learning.</p><p><em>Relationships</em>. Children benefit from the caring and respectful way educators and visiting teachers relate with them, their parents and with each other. ERO observed children interacting comfortably with their educators and playing well with and alongside each other.</p><p><em>Group-learning experiences.</em> The children benefit from a variety of interesting group learning experiences and excursions. They frequently attend play and music groups, venture into the local community and environment or other educators&rsquo; homes. Educators and visiting teachers have increased their focus on extending children&rsquo;s enjoyment and appreciation of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori.</p><p><em>Professional learning.</em> Managers have a strong focus on promoting high quality practice. They model good practice in teaching and learning and lead staff in meaningful training for working with children. Educators and visiting teachers benefit from a range of opportunities provided to extend their professional learning.</p><p><em>Leadership and management.</em> The business manager and team leader bring to the service considerable professional experience in early childhood education. They work well together and have quickly gained the professional respect of their staff.</p><p><em>Culture of improvement.</em> The service manager and team leader have a very strong focus on providing a high quality service for children. In March 2011 they carried out a thorough quality assurance/review which was used to help them set plans to meet the new regulations for early childhood and the licensing criteria for home-based education and care. In a short period of time they have improved the quality of support for visiting teachers and educators, and revised and reviewed many of the service&rsquo;s systems, policies and procedures.</p><h3>Area for development and review</h3><p><em>Extending self review.</em> Self review could be extended to include a greater focus on teaching and learning. This should include how well:</p><ul>
<li>professional development priorities are evident in practice, such as in monthly reports and learning stories</li>
<li>visiting teachers&rsquo; interactions with educators promote children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>the team leader ensures visiting teachers are meeting the service&rsquo;s expectations</li>
<li>records of support by staff are used to manage and monitor performance</li>
<li>planned and spontaneous reviews include parent and educator views and identify clear next steps for future action.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of KidStart Invercargill South completed an ERO Home-Based Care Assurance Statement and Self Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>16 March 2012</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>
