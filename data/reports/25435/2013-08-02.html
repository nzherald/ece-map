</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Nanaksar Education Phulwari has been operating since April 2009. This is the centre’s first ERO report. The service provides full-day education and care for up to 38 children from two to five years of age. Children are organised into two groupings in separate rooms that are arranged to cater for children’s stages of development. Children are encouraged to move between the rooms and learn alongside their peers and siblings.</p><p>The centre operates under the education wing of the Anand Isher Education and Community Trust (AIEC Trust) which is an Indian charitable organisation. The centre is in a Sikh Temple complex. The roll is made up of children from Indian cultures. It welcomes children who may attend from time to time from the surrounding multi-ethnic community. The trustees of the Temple operate the education wing alongside, but separately from the religious wing.</p><p>The centre philosophy acknowledges children as capable learners who learn at their own pace. The teacher’s role is seen as facilitation of children’s learning through play. For many children and families the English language is a new medium for learning.</p><p>A third of the teachers have been with the centre since it opened. The management group comprises members of the trust and volunteers who own a group of private centres and are members of the Sikh community. Half of the teaching team are provisionally registered teachers, and two staff are participating in training. The centre supervisor position has recently become vacant. The centre administrator has assumed most of the leadership responsibilities. He is supported by an external curriculum adviser and leader.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children interact confidently with one another and with their teachers. Independence and self-help skills are promoted. Children manage their own play and eating routines well. Children’s home languages are frequently heard during the programme as teachers from the same ethnic backgrounds interact with them. Programmes are developed to support children to learn the English language while engaging in the programme.</p><p>Teachers are committed to extending their knowledge of the Māori language and celebrating cultural celebrations such as Matarīki. Records and displays show that aspects of Māori and Samoan cultures have been a recent focus in planning. In the past Samoan families have attended the centre and have contributed to the enrichment of the programme.</p><p>Managers value the important role that parents have in supporting children’s ongoing learning. Formal and informal interactions focus on developing parents’ understandings about <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum and how children learn through play. Parents are encouraged to support children’s learning in the centre and at home. This valuable learning is beginning to be shared between parents and teachers and should help build a partnership with families so they can contribute effectively to the ongoing learning opportunities for their children.</p><p>Comprehensive management systems have been introduced. A sound framework has been developed to ensure that employment systems and processes comply with legal requirements. The managers and staff are reviewing these systems to ensure that policies and procedures are relevant and meaningful to Nanaksar Education Phulwari. They have begun aligning policies to the 2008 Early Childhood Regulations and Licensing Criteria. Health and safety systems are functioning effectively. New self-review systems are also effective and result in improvements to practice. Further development should continue to help staff fully understand and participate in reviews.</p><p>Staff capacity is being built through staff annual appraisals and goal setting opportunities for professional development. Teachers have opportunities to evaluate and make improvements to their own practices. Provisionally registered teachers are mentored toward full teacher registration and unqualified teachers participate in training. Managers are gradually building the skill and learning of the very new teaching team.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers should continue to support improvements by:</p><ul>
<li>building emerging leadership in the teaching team</li>
<li>reviewing and improving appraisal processes by linking them to the Registered Teacher Criteria</li>
<li>further embedding self-review practices within the teaching team</li>
<li>supporting children to extend and sustain imaginative play by rearranging the layout, accessibility, and range of resources in both rooms</li>
<li>developing child-led learning through responsive and reciprocal teaching and learning practices.</li>
</ul><p>The trust is considering appointing a centre manager to oversee operations and improve management practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nanaksar Education Phulwari completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Nanaksar Education Phulwari will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>2 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
