</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Hayman Park Tahi offers education and care for 50 children from 3 months to three and a half years in either sessional or all-day provision. Children are catered for in a purpose-built facility on the grounds of the Manukau City Baptist Church. The indoor setting is divided into age-related rooms and toddlers have freedom of movement throughout all the indoor and outdoor spaces.</p><p>The ABC Hayman group of centres on the site includes this centre (Tahi) and a large separate building (Rua) that provides for older children. Both Tahi and Rua centres have their own head teacher who report to the newly appointed centre manager. Both centres share a philosophy of teachers and whānau working together to enable children to achieve their potential and to be confident, competent lifelong learners.</p><p>The majority of children attending the multicultural centre are Pacific, Indian or Pākehā. Staff reflect the multicultural community well.</p><p>The centre is part of the BestStart Education and Care Centres organisation, which provides an overarching governance and management framework as well as personnel to support individual centres. The centre manager and head teacher provide leadership in the centre and are supported by the BestStart professional services (PSM) and business managers. All teachers are qualified and the centre shares an administrator and a cook with the Rua centre.</p><p>This centre has responded well to the areas for improvement identified in the 2013 ERO report. These included offering a more child-focused programme, opportunities for families to share their aspirations, and developing a shared understanding about teaching practices that enable children to become self-managing learners.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed to the centre. Children settle quickly into the daily programme. Good positive relationships and interactions with babies and toddlers are evident. Nurturing, friendly teachers cater well for babies' and toddlers' care needs. Children have a strong sense of belonging to the centre.</p><p>Teachers recognise and value children learning through play. Children have many opportunities to choose from the wide variety of high quality resources and provocations offered. Significant upgrading of the resources, equipment and outdoor environment is providing further engagement in learning experiences for children.</p><p>Teachers have a strong focus on extending children's oral language by appropriate modelling and talking to them in meaningful ways. Opportunities for children to revisit experiences are available through the many displays of children's interests, artwork and learning stories. Teachers display posters about the ways children learn for parent education and information.</p><p>The programme and environment strongly reflects the organisation's commitment to a bicultural approach. The BestStart organisation has recently employed a national bicultural advisor to support teachers with growing their confidence in providing a culturally responsive curriculum.</p><p>Teachers have a deliberate approach and demonstrate a commitment to promoting cultural diversity. They value children's identity, culture, and languages and this has had a significant impact on children's and families' sense of belonging and well-being. Teachers interact respectfully with children using a variety of home languages.</p><p>The centre offers a learning programme strongly based on the principles of the <em>Te Whariki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. The centre manager and PSM agree that a stronger focus by teachers on children's evolving dispositions and emerging interests could be beneficial when planning programmes to extend and challenge children's learning. They have also identified that teachers reflecting on the impact of their teaching on children's learning and progress could support this process. It could be useful for teachers to consider identifying and making more evident the theories of early childhood education that they follow.</p><p>Parents are welcome partners in their child's learning. Teachers offer many formal and informal opportunities to meet with parents to discuss their child's learning progress. They gather family aspirations to contribute to programme planning.</p><p>Centre leaders make good use of the BestStart organisation's internal evaluation processes and guidelines. These include appraisal and performance management systems that are based on useful evidence. Newly appointed and registering teachers are very well supported by the centre manager and PSM through the strong coaching and mentoring process.</p><p>BestStart has effective systems for monitoring service operations. These include regular management meetings and an internal audit process that is used to identify centre challenges and develop plans for improvement. The centre has a suitable strategic plan that is linked to the BestStart vision and long-term plan and is regularly monitored. Centre practices reflect the collaboratively developed philosophy.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager, PSM and business managers have identified their next steps and ERO affirms that they are priorities for ongoing improvement. They include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>supporting teachers to inquire into the impact of their teaching on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extending planning and assessment practices to meet children's individual needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation by identifying indicators of good practice with which to evaluate the effectiveness or quality of the area under review.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Hayman Park Tahi completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Hayman Park Tahi will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>14 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
