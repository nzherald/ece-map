</table><p>The service needs support to develop strategic planning, improve self-review practices, and strengthen aspects of governance and leadership.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Jade-Star Young Children’s Centre is one of two privately-owned centres in Caversham, Dunedin. The centres are on one site. A manager has overall responsibility for the two centres. Each centre has a head teacher with the day-to-day responsibility for the teaching and learning.</p><p>All staff in the centre are qualified teachers. They provide full-day education and care for up to 32 children aged from two years to school age. Children attending the centre come from across Dunedin City.</p><p>The owner of Jade Star Young Children’s centre does not keep himself adequately informed about how well the centre is promoting positive outcomes for children. With the centre leaders, he needs to develop strategic planning to guide the centre direction. A clearer philosophy for the centre will help guide the teachers in all aspects of their work with children.</p><p>Since the September 2011 ERO report there have been improvements to the outdoor play area. The centre leaders have recently begun to improve self-review practices as recommended in that report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from a planned programme where teachers respond to children’s strengths and interests. Children have a range of interesting learning experiences including a weekly outing to the library book bus.</p><p>Teachers have developed a very useful format for individual planning. This gives good guidance about the strategies they will use to support children’s learning. In the best examples, the plans are evaluated and records of learning show children’s progress over time. Teachers should now find ways to make these best examples of practice more consistent and widespread.</p><p>Teachers regularly discuss children’s learning and development with parents and include parents’ wishes for their children’s learning in the individual plans. Teachers share information so that children are well supported when they move from the infants and toddler’s centre next door.</p><p>All teachers have been involved in sustained professional development in 2014 about mathematics. This has led to a richer inclusion of mathematics in the programme and helped teachers to show this in records of learning.</p><p>Teachers include some te reo Māori and tikanga practices in the daily programme. They have identified that this is an area for further development.</p><h3>Governance and Leadership</h3><p>The manager has recently sought professional development to strengthen leadership of the centre. Through this she has identified a number of areas that would strengthen centre practices. These include:</p><ul>
<li>holding formal meetings more regularly with the head teachers</li>
<li>building shared understandings about centre priorities amongst teachers</li>
<li>clarifying expectations for teachers’ work</li>
<li>implementing self review and developing priorities for review.</li>
</ul><p>These are in the very early stages of implementation.</p><p>The manager and teachers are redeveloping the centre vision and philosophy with the support of the professional development provider. When this process is completed, they should review centre practices, routines, the environment and centre priorities for learning to ensure they align with the redeveloped philosophy.</p><p>Staff appraisals are not up to date. The appraisal process would be strengthened by aligning the goals to the registered teachers’ criteria and centre priorities.</p><p>The owner needs to take a more active role in monitoring how well the centre is meeting all its obligations. He should ensure that there is strategic and short-term planning to guide the centre’s future direction. He needs to ensure that the manager is appraised and supported in her role.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the owner, manager and teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop strategic planning to guide the centre’s direction</li>
<li>improve self-review practices, including teacher appraisals</li>
<li>further develop the centre philosophy</li>
<li>review centre practice against the philosophy</li>
<li>strengthen leadership within the centre.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Jade-Star Young Children's Centre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>Documentation of some health and safety practices should be strengthened. Parents should sign their consent for the risk management of regular excursions and the medications forms should be updated.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Jade-Star Young Children's Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer-Southern</p><p>12 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
