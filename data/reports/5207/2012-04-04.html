<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Arataki Free Kindergarten is located in Mount Maunganui. It operates under the umbrella of the Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association to provide education and care for children from two years to school age. It is licensed for 45 children and at the time of this ERO review had a roll of 70, including 11 who are identified as M&#257;ori. The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy expresses a commitment to inspiring respectful, responsive and inquisitive learners in partnership with children, families and communities. Since the previous review, the teaching staff has remained consistent.</p><p>The kindergarten is well supported by the association through the provision of policy and organisational frameworks and procedures. An experienced and knowledgeable head teacher has developed a cohesive teaching team who work in the best interests of children and their families.</p><p>A feature of the kindergarten is the strong and inclusive partnerships formed amongst teachers, children and their families, that contribute to a strong sense of belonging and well-being.</p><p>The kindergarten provides an interesting and spacious learning environment that invites children to explore and experiment. Children have ready access to high-quality resources that provide for safe physical challenge, and enhance academic and social skills.</p><p>Teachers plan a rich programme that acknowledges children&rsquo;s emerging interests. ERO observed examples of high-quality teaching interactions that included appropriate use of technical language, open-ended questioning, and conversations that extended children&rsquo;s thinking and problem solving skills. Children benefit from teachers&rsquo; meaningful integration of tools and technology into the daily programme. Te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori are well integrated in meaningful contexts. A wide range of community and specialist involvement enhances children&rsquo;s learning experiences. Parents&rsquo; participation in frequent, kindergarten-funded, excursions enables them to share in their children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>A next step for teachers is to further review assessment, planning and evaluation practices and make changes that are likely to engage and extend all children in purposeful play.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Arataki Free Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atArataki Free Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Arataki Free Kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association to provide education and care for children from three years to school age. The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy expresses a commitment to inspiring respectful, responsive and inquisitive learners in partnership with children, families and communities. Since the previous ERO review the teaching staff has remained consistent.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><b>Partnership for learning:</b> A feature of the kindergarten is the strong and inclusive partnerships formed amongst teachers, children and their families. Teachers place high priority on knowing children and their families well. Parents&rsquo; responses gathered during the review expressed appreciation for the support provided for them and their children by teachers. Contributions from parents in assessment practices and regular access to individual profile books empower them as active partners in children&rsquo;s learning at the kindergarten. Their involvement in frequent, kindergarten-funded excursions enables them to share in their children&rsquo;s learning. Positive partnerships are contributing to a strong sense of belonging and well-being for children and their families.</p><p><b>Environment:</b> The kindergarten provides an interesting and spacious learning environment that invites children to explore and experiment. Features of the environment include:</p><ul>
<li>a strong focus on sustainability including recycling, worm farming, gardening, care of pets and water awareness;</li>
<li>children&rsquo;s ready access to high-quality resources that provide for safe physical challenge and which enhance academic and social skills;</li>
<li>wall displays that celebrate children&rsquo;s creativity and support their emerging knowledge of literacy, mathematics and the wider world;</li>
<li>a strong reflection of a M&#257;ori dimension;</li>
<li>an emphasis on New Zealand&rsquo;s natural environment; and</li>
<li>a recent upgrade of the indoor area that benefits teachers, children and their families.</li>
</ul><p><b>Programme and interactions:</b> Teachers plan a rich programme that acknowledges children&rsquo;s emerging interests. ERO observed examples of high-quality teaching interactions that included appropriate use of technical language, open-ended questioning and conversations that extended children&rsquo;s thinking and problem-solving skills. Children&rsquo;s learning is extended by frequent excursions to places of interest in the local and wider community. The programme provides many opportunities for children to play for sustained periods of time in groups of their own choosing. Children demonstrated confidence as they engaged in dramatic and creative play with their friends. They benefit from teachers&rsquo; meaningful integration of tools and technology into the daily programme. Te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori are well integrated in meaningful contexts. A wide range of community and specialist involvement enhances children&rsquo;s learning experiences.</p><h4>Agreed priorities for development and review</h4><p><b>Self review:</b> While the kindergarten undertakes aspects of self review, deepening these processes is likely to contribute to improved outcomes for children. Particular attention should be given to further reviewing and developing:</p><ul>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation practices to engage and extend all children in purposeful play;</li>
<li>routine times that support children&rsquo;s ability to sustain their play and make choices; and</li>
<li>processes for ensuring teachers receive regular and robust feedback about their practice.</li>
</ul><p>Improving self review is likely to strengthen the kindergarten&rsquo;s culture of reflective practice.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Arataki Free Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

It operates under the umbrella of the Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association to provide education and care for children from two years to school age. It is licensed for 45 children and at the time of this ERO review had a roll of 70, including 11 who are identified as M&#257;ori. The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy expresses a commitment to inspiring respectful, responsive and inquisitive learners in partnership with children, families and communities. Since the previous review, the teaching staff has remained consistent.</p><p>The kindergarten is well supported by the association through the provision of policy and organisational frameworks and procedures. An experienced and knowledgeable head teacher has developed a cohesive teaching team who work in the best interests of children and their families.</p><p>A feature of the kindergarten is the strong and inclusive partnerships formed amongst teachers, children and their families, that contribute to a strong sense of belonging and well-being.</p><p>The kindergarten provides an interesting and spacious learning environment that invites children to explore and experiment. Children have ready access to high-quality resources that provide for safe physical challenge, and enhance academic and social skills.</p><p>Teachers plan a rich programme that acknowledges children&rsquo;s emerging interests. ERO observed examples of high-quality teaching interactions that included appropriate use of technical language, open-ended questioning, and conversations that extended children&rsquo;s thinking and problem solving skills. Children benefit from teachers&rsquo; meaningful integration of tools and technology into the daily programme. Te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori are well integrated in meaningful contexts. A wide range of community and specialist involvement enhances children&rsquo;s learning experiences. Parents&rsquo; participation in frequent, kindergarten-funded, excursions enables them to share in their children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>A next step for teachers is to further review assessment, planning and evaluation practices and make changes that are likely to engage and extend all children in purposeful play.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information About Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
