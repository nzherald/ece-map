</div><div class="WordSection4">
<h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3>
<p>Children at Rotary Park Kindergarten play and learn in a well-resourced environment. The teachers provide a high quality programme. The kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for its children.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Rotary Park Kindergarten is a community based kindergarten which provides sessional and full-day programmes for children aged two to five years. The families and committee are very supportive. Over the past two years the kindergarten has made significant upgrades to the inside and outside environments.</p>
<p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in eight early childhood education services within the Dunedin Kindergartens (DK) umbrella organisation.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p>Teachers have very good relationships with children and their families. They know the children well. Parents are comfortable to stay for periods of time to settle and join their children in their play. Children play well together and independently. They are very involved and sustained in their work and play.</p>
<p>Teachers encourage children to take responsibility, be independent and take on leadership roles in their learning. The children have many opportunities to learn about the natural environment for example, gardening, caring for pets and developing sustainable practices. Currently there is a focus on children learning sign language. The children hear and use te reo Maori and there is effective inclusion of Maori perspectives in the kindergarten.</p>
<p>The teachers use children's interests as a starting point for well-designed group planning. They think and plan carefully for the inclusion of all children. Records of group planning make it very clear to teachers, children and families what children are learning.</p>
</div><div class="WordSection5">
<p>Other aspects of the programme that support children's learning include:</p>
<ul>
<li>o a strong focus on early literacy and mathematics</li>
<li>the use of information communication technologies (ICT) as a tool to extend children's thinking</li>
<li>enjoyable spontaneous small-group times where children practise songs and dramatise familiar and favourite stories</li>
<li>effective practices to support children and their families as children transition to school</li>
<li>good opportunities for physical activity and exploration.</li>
</ul>
<p>The teaching team work well together. They continually review what they do and use each others strengths and interests in the programme to benefit the children. They have well-developed self review processes. Recent reviews have led to positive changes and new initiatives.</p>
<p>Teachers are well supported by the senior teachers of the DK and receive good support for ongoing professional learning to improve outcomes for children. The DK managers and governors have a clear strategic direction and sound policy framework to support the kindergarten.</p>
<h3>Area for development and review</h3>
<p>ERO and management agree that the teachers need to review and further strengthen:</p>
<ul>
<li>how they make clear and record what individual children's learning priorities are and the strategies teachers use to support them.</li>
</ul>
<a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Rotary Park Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the review, ERO looked at the service's systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2>
<h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p>

<a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2>
</div><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere - how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Arahi - how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Matauranga - whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako - how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and whanau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
