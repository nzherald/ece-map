</table><p>Central Kids Kindergartens – Clyde Street is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Clyde Street, located in Tokoroa, provides education and care for children from two years to school age in a school-day programme. The kindergarten is licensed for 30 children, and at the time of this review had a roll of 45. There are 18 children identified as Māori who whakapapa to a range of different iwi. In addition, there is a significant number of children from Pacific backgrounds including seven of Cook Island descent. The ethnicity of the current teaching staff reflects the multi-cultural nature of the kindergarten and the community. The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust, (known as Central Kids). Its philosophy places strong priority on building positive relationships among people, and recognising significant places and taonga in the local community.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO review there has been one change in the teaching staff. Central Kids have funded significant improvements to the indoor and outdoor environments, including landscaping of the playground, refurbishing the kitchen and foyer, and creating a new staff work area. Teachers have engaged in a wide range of professional learning and development opportunities that support the kindergarten’s focus on building children’s social competencies.</p><p>The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 13 reviews in the Central Kids umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from participating in a programme that is responsive to their emerging interests. Teachers’ recent professional development is supporting them to empower children to be independent, solve their own problems, and develop persistence and resilience. ERO observed:</p><ul>
<li>caring relationships among teachers and children</li>
<li>teachers involving themselves in play alongside children</li>
<li>teachers commenting and conversing with children about their everyday lives</li>
<li>children who were settled, confident and secure in the kindergarten environment.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have reviewed the way the learning environment supports and sustains children’s play. They ensure children have access to a wide range of attractively presented resources and equipment. Children’s achievements are celebrated through wall displays that acknowledge their early literacy skills. The indoor areas are welcoming and inviting for parents and children, and reflect the kindergarten’s philosophy of building strong relationships with whānau. Teachers place priority on establishing a home-like environment for children and their families.</p><p>Programme priorities include the natural integration of literacy and mathematics in children’s play, environmental sustainability, and supporting children’s cultural identity. Teachers share children’s involvement in the programme in a range of ways including stories and photographs displayed on walls, and in individual portfolios. Resources and activities include the use of te reo and Pacific languages, stories and objects that reflect the cultures of the Pacific, and pepeha from whānau to share their whakapapa.</p><p>The head teacher knows the local community well and is knowledgeable about Māori and Pacific cultures. She models effective teaching practice and is responsive to the needs of teachers, children and their families. The head teacher has accessed a wide range of external expertise to support teachers and the ongoing development of the kindergarten. She provides many opportunities for teachers and parents to develop their leadership skills and share their expertise with children, and leads a wide range of self-review processes to bring about improvement.</p><p>The trust is supportive of the kindergarten. The professional leader from Central Kids has a long-standing association with the kindergarten and provides the head teacher and teachers with support and guidance. Comprehensive policy guidelines assist staff to meet regulatory requirements and the Central Kids’ standards and expectations.</p><p>As part of this review, ERO evaluated the effectiveness of the kindergarten’s responsibilities for the employment and management of staff. Central Kids have developed and implemented highly effective processes to manage and appoint staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At the time of this ERO review, the head teacher was in the early stages of reviewing assessment, planning and evaluation practices. ERO and the kindergarten leaders agree that the next step is to develop useful and manageable processes to notice, recognise and respond to children’s’ learning. This development should be prioritised in the annual plan, and the new assessment processes linked to teacher professional development, appraisal and self review.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Clyde Street completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Clyde Street will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>5 July 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
