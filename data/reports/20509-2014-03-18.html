</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Warkworth Kindergarten is located in the small rural community of Warkworth. The centre provides sessional and full day care for up to thirty five children from two and a half to five years of age. The centre operates in a purpose-built building that has continued to be modified to provide linked playing spaces for children.</p><p>The centre community includes children and whānau from a number of cultures. Māori whānau are particularly well supported to feel comfortable in the centre and to contribute to the programme. All families are encouraged to share information to enable teachers to work effectively with children.</p><p>Since ERO’s 2011 review, the service provider has employed new staff. She continues to provide teachers with professional development to further embed understanding of Reggio Emilia aspects in the centre programme. Teachers use <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum to underpin te reo Māori and tikanga Māori influences in teaching programmes.</p><p>ERO’s 2011 report noted the centre’s good practices and effective teaching. The report recommended that teachers continue to develop assessment and planning processes and further embed understanding about the centre’s philosophy. The centre continues to provide good quality education and care for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and confident in the centre. They capably take ownership of and self-select their play. They are eager explorers of their environment. Children’s sense of well being and belonging is supported by the professional and warm relationships between teachers and families. As a result, children are calm and engaged in collaborative play.</p><p>Teachers provide positive opportunities for all children to understand the significance of Māori as tangata whenua. Children benefit from the richness of their play environment. Teachers have created beautiful and interesting spaces for different types of play with a strong focus on Māori art and design. Children treat the environment with respect and enjoy it.</p><p>Staff build meaningful partnerships with whānau and iwi within their community. The ideas of whānau, their aspirations for their children and their involvement in programmes helps teachers to confidently foster children’s understanding and learning about biculturalism.</p><p>Children respond positively to teachers’ support for their play. Teachers’ focus on aspects of the Reggio Emilia philosophy includes prompting children’s thinking and interest in their own discoveries and explorations. Literacy and numeracy are included meaningfully in the programme. The emphasis on children feeling confident in all areas of their learning is helping to build up children’s readiness for school over time.</p><p>Management systems, policies and procedures are well developed and effectively used to operate the centre efficiently. The philosophical approach is a regular topic for review and discussions are shared between teachers, management and families. Teachers regularly record their observations about their own practice and are supported to attend professional development to continue their own professional growth.</p><p>Thorough self review processes guide ongoing improvement and reflection within the centre. Teachers’ written documentation about the results of reviews helps them to revisit decision-making and further monitor change.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre managers agree that the next steps are for teachers to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>further build bicultural practice and strengthen iwi connections</li>
<li>develop teachers’ shared understanding of the approaches used to guide the programme and embed good practice to align with the centre vision</li>
<li>acknowledge parent and whānau aspirations and contributions in centre documentation</li>
<li>develop assessment processes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Warkworth Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Warkworth Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>18 March 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
