<p align="left">Snells Beach Kindergarten is situated in a semi-rural coastal area near Warkworth and is part of Auckland Kindergarten Association. The Association provides a range of policies and procedures to support centre operations and teacher professional development. The good quality teaching noted in the 2009 ERO report continues to be evident.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers provide children with a stimulating and inclusive programme. They have high expectations for children&rsquo;s learning and support child-initiated play, creativity and exploration. Teachers interact with children in supportive and affirming ways. Opportunities for children to learn skills in literacy, numeracy and information and communication technologies (ICT) are appropriately integrated throughout the programme.</p>
<p align="left">Children are confident communicators who <span>have sustained conversations with peers and adults.</span> Their creativity is nurtured and they enjoy music, dance and using writing and numbers<span>in play.</span> They eagerly join in group play in a variety of planned and spontaneous play experiences. The kindergarten environment is aesthetically pleasing with high quality resources that support children&rsquo;s play, learning and development. Children have good opportunities for physically active and imaginative play in the landscaped outside area.</p>
<p align="left">Since the last ERO report, teachers have maintained strong community connections. Areas for improvement noted in the 2009 report have been the focus of review and development. Teachers have reviewed their assessment and planning processes. They are aware that they could continue to enhance aspects of planning and evaluation.</p>
<p align="left">Mutually responsive and supportive relationships between teachers, promote a Teachers&rsquo; commitment to bicultural values and to using tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori is reflected in their practice. Teachers are reflective and improvement focused. ERO recommends that teachers continue to explore ways to evaluate and enhance their teaching practices, and suggests that they include parents and children further in this process.<span>parents and wh&#257;nau</span><span>sense of partnership.</span></p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p align="left">Before the review, the management of Snells Beach Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atSnells Beach Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p align="left">Since the 2009 ERO review the kindergarten has changed from a sessional centre to a kindergarten day model. There have been alterations to the building and the kindergarten has been relicensed under the 2008 Regulations and Licensing Criteria. Teachers have been involved in professional development. The current head teacher has been at the kindergarten for a considerable length of time. She is well respected in the community and has continued to promote good relationships within the teaching team and with the wider community.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p align="left">Programme implementation. Teachers work collaboratively to provide a stimulating and inclusive programme that reflects their teaching philosophy. Their respect for child-initiated play, creativity and exploration is evident in the programme. High expectations and meaningful learning opportunities contribute to children:</p>
<ul>
<li>making decisions and choices about their involvement and participation in activities and play scenarios</li>
<li>playing cooperatively and engaging in sustained conversations</li>
<li>developing responsibility for themselves and others as part of the culture of care</li>
<li>being familiar with the use te reo M&#257;ori and having a knowledge of aspects of tikanga M&#257;ori</li>
<li>being eager to learn and confident in their own abilities.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Teachers&rsquo; interactions with children are consistently affirming and supportive. They know the children well and are responsive to their ideas and interests.</p>
<p align="left">Learning environment. Teachers provide an attractive, inviting environment with high quality resources to support children&rsquo;s play, creativity, learning and development. The interior is thoughtfully presented with interesting and inviting spaces that prompt children&rsquo;s independent exploration and engagement in specific types of play. The landscaped outdoor area reflects the local and New Zealand environment. It provides a wide variety of physically challenging equipment and opportunities for children to gain an early understanding of science concepts in real life situations.</p>
<p align="left">Learning through play. Teachers foster children&rsquo;s curiosity and build on their prior knowledge through a wide range of educational experiences. Children are well supported to learn through creative play, to investigate situations that build on their interests, and to share their ideas with others.</p>
<p align="left">Partnerships with parents and community. Parents are warmly welcomed and are encouraged to be involved in their children&rsquo;s learning and in centre activities. A recent survey undertaken by the Auckland Kindergarten Association reported high levels of parent satisfaction with the centre. Parents receive good information about centre events and the programme in action. Children&rsquo;s assessment portfolios are a good link between home and centre and are increasingly supported by parents&rsquo; contributions. The portfolios are highly valued by children, parents and teachers. The kindergarten takes part in community events and makes good use of local facilities. Teachers provide good support for children&rsquo;s transition to school.</p>
<p align="left">Self review. Teachers are reflective practitioners who use self review to guide decisions about improvements to the kindergarten environment, programmes and teaching practices. They actively seek ways to involve parents/wh&#257;nau and children in their reviews. The annual plan provides a good framework for continuous improvement and monitoring of outcomes.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p align="left">Teachers are continuing to review and enhance teaching, assessment and planning practices. In doing so, they could consider more consistently:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left">evaluating planning strategies to show connections and progress in children&rsquo;s portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">including parents and children in programme planning and evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Teachers could consider investigating additional strategies to promote children&rsquo;s independent thinking and inquiry skills and their engagement in play. These strategies should enhance the rich learning experiences provided in the programme.</p>
<a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3>
<p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing wellbeing, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p align="left">Snells Beach Kindergarten implements the policies and procedures of the Auckland Kindergarten Association in relation to the inclusion of children with special needs. The centre currently has children with special needs attending and has enrolled children with special needs in the past.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p align="left">Teachers display commitment and sensitivity to the inclusion of children with special needs. Children with special education needs are well supported to access the curriculum. They benefit from:</p>
<ul>
<li>a caring, inclusive environment that is organised and equipped to meet the needs of all children</li>
<li>teachers who work closely with families, encouraging them to participate and ensuring they are kept well informed about their children&rsquo;s progress</li>
<li>the support of Education Support Workers (ESW), who are valued and included as an integral component of the teaching team</li>
<li>being actively involved in social play and group learning situations.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Teachers welcome children with special needs and their families into the centre and work collaboratively with external agencies to provide them with good quality education and specialised support when needed.</p>
<a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Snells Beach Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-snells-beach-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Snells Beach Kindergarten</h2>
<p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Snells Beach Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">Snells Beach Kindergarten is situated in a semi-rural coastal area near Warkworth and is part of Auckland Kindergarten Association. The Association provides a range of policies and procedures to support centre operations and teacher professional development. The good quality teaching noted in the 2009 ERO report continues to be evident.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers provide children with a stimulating and inclusive programme. They have high expectations for children&rsquo;s learning and support child-initiated play, creativity and exploration. Teachers interact with children in supportive and affirming ways. Opportunities for children to learn skills in literacy, numeracy and information and communication technologies (ICT) are appropriately integrated throughout the programme.</p>
<p align="left">Children are confident communicators who <span>have sustained conversations with peers and adults.</span> Their creativity is nurtured and they enjoy music, dance and using writing and numbers<span>in play.</span> They eagerly join in group play in a variety of planned and spontaneous play experiences. The kindergarten environment is aesthetically pleasing with high quality resources that support children&rsquo;s play, learning and development. Children have good opportunities for physically active and imaginative play in the landscaped outside area.</p>
<p align="left">Since the last ERO report, teachers have maintained strong community connections. Areas for improvement noted in the 2009 report have been the focus of review and development. Teachers have reviewed their assessment and planning processes. They are aware that they could continue to enhance aspects of planning and evaluation.</p>
<p align="left">Mutually responsive and supportive relationships between teachers, promote a Teachers&rsquo; commitment to bicultural values and to using tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori is reflected in their practice. Teachers are reflective and improvement focused. ERO recommends that teachers continue to explore ways to evaluate and enhance their teaching practices, and suggests that they include parents and children further in this process.<span>parents and wh&#257;nau</span><span>sense of partnership.</span></p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>
