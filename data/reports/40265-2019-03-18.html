</table><p>Central City Quality Edu-care (Pukaki St) requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Governance and leadership needs strengthening to ensure the curriculum design is clearly aligned to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, early childhood curriculum<em>.</em> Further support is required to raise teacher capability through a robust appraisal process. Accurate records of all centre documentation need to be kept. Further consultation with parents is required, particularly around assessment and planning and internal evaluation.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central City Quality Edu-care (Pukaki St) is a mixed-age, all-day education and care service, based in the central city of Rotorua. It is licensed for 35 children, including up to 10 under the age of two years. At the time of this review 27 children were enrolled, including 10 of whom identify as Māori and a small number of children from other ethnicities.</p><p>The centre is one of two under the same private ownership. The director who is a qualified teacher, supports both centre managers and a team of qualified and unqualified teachers.</p><p>Through the centre philosophy teachers aim to promote a safe, caring and healthy environment where children are supported to develop life skills working alongside their peers. Teachers aim to give children time and space to play and develop social skills. Te reo and tikanga Māori are promoted and all cultures are respected within the centre. Teachers are committed to forming strong connections between home and the centre.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in March 2016, little progress has been made in developing a robust appraisal system. A strategic and annual plan has been developed and requires further strengthening.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Warm relationships have been developed among children, whānau, teachers and leaders. The small group size at the centre benefits children as teachers know them and their whānau well. Children's oral language skills are well supported. Teachers now need to use more open-ended questioning and learning conversations to further empower children to lead their own learning. Transitions into the centre are well considered. Children with additional learning needs are supported through inclusive teaching practices. Opportunities are provided for children to work independently or in groups. Children have developed a sense of belonging at the centre.</p><p>Curriculum design needs further strengthening to reflect the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>. Further review of the curriculum is required, particularly around the structured transition class, the impact of teacher-led routines, and the education and care for infants and toddlers. This review should also consider how literacy could be more naturally integrated and how the daily programme could be more child-led, in line with current research, and to realise the intent of the philosophy and <em>Te Whāriki.</em></p><p>Features of the programme include opportunities for tuakana/teina relationships to foster reciprocal learning between older or more competent siblings and peers. Trips into the local community enrich the programme. Elements of a bicultural programme are evident. Exploration of children's whakapapa and making links to local iwi would further strengthen the bicultural curriculum and support success for Maōri learners.</p><p>The assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning needs to be strengthened to show progression of learning over time. The newly introduced system to document planning for individual children now needs to be consistently implemented. There is a need to consider how intentional teaching is scaffolding children’s learning, seeking parent aspirations and child voice, and capturing individual children’s language, culture and identity.</p><p>Leaders have established a culture of relational trust and collaborative ways of working. Some emergent leadership amongst teachers is fostered. Leadership now needs to strengthen teaching capability to plan individual learning pathways for children and review the curriculum.</p><p>A low turnover of staff and positive team culture contribute to positive outcomes for children. A self review framework is in place and beginning to lead to positive changes. An effective vision for the service has been developed. The philosophy and policies are reviewed annually. However, management of the service requires further development. There is a need to strengthen the documentation of reviews and consult with parents and all stakeholders. Systems and processes are in place to guide health and safety practice. Leaders must ensure that accurate records are kept relating to these systems.</p><p>The annual plan requires further strengthening to show clearer alignment to the new three-year strategic plan and vision and to guide centre operations focused on ongoing improvements. A strong priority for the service is to urgently embed a newly developed appraisal system into practice to ensure that teacher capability is supported and that the endorsement of teacher's registrations are compliant with relevant legislation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps for Central City Quality Edu-care (Pukaki) are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>support teachers to increase their knowledge of the revised curriculum <em>Te Whāriki</em> in order to develop a more responsive curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>keep accurate documentation and records relating to health and safety, and policy and philosophy review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement and embed a robust appraisal system for teachers.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central City Quality Edu-care (Pukaki St) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to appraisal and the endorsement for teacher registration and the safety and police checking of workforce. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure that a system of regular appraisal is documented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>safety checking and police vetting for non-registered teachers is undertaken for all core and non-core children's workers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide a curriculum which is consistent with <em>Te Whāriki</em> and informed by assessment, planning and evaluation that demonstrates an understanding of children's learning, their interests, whānau and life contexts.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7, GMA7A, C1, C2.</em></p><p>In order to improve practice, records need to be accurately documented for accidents, sleep, and earthquake drills. (HS25, HS9, HS8).</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>18 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
