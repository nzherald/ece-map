</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Onehunga Playcentre is a parent cooperative that operates within the Auckland Playcentre Association. The centre runs five mixed age sessions each week, plus one session for children over four years.</p><p>Parents, as educators, participate in playcentre training to support children’s learning and to take on leadership roles in the centre. Experienced centre members share their knowledge with newer members and support them to play active roles in the centre's operations.</p><p>Previous ERO reports have commented very favourably about the centre’s positive relationships and practices. Members have responded well to the recommendations in ERO’s 2010 report to help them promote very effective learning experiences for children</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Effective administration systems, with clear delegation of roles and a shared sense of purpose, enable sessions to focus on promoting children’s learning. Centre members’ commitment to the Playcentre philosophy is evident as they work cooperatively in planning and implementing a child-focused programme.</p><p>Adults have a shared interest in, and responsibility for, the education and well being of all children. They provide a welcoming and unhurried atmosphere that helps children to interact positively with each other and to show confidence when relating with adults other than their parents.</p><p>Members respect children as capable learners and are highly supportive of children’s preferences. They are familiar with current theories of good educational practice for early childhood learning and assessment, and use a range of assessment strategies for recognising and enhancing children’s learning. They respond to the needs of individual children, both developmentally and educationally. Literacy and numeracy learning is integrated into the programme to help children learn early concepts, skills and knowledge within meaningful contexts.</p><p>Inclusive practices enable infants and toddlers to interact with and learn from older children and adults. A carefully designed programme offers older children experiences to extend their skills in communication, group play, and individual responsibility.</p><p>Children’s cultural backgrounds are respected and valued. Aspects of te reo and tikanga Māori help all children to develop an early awareness of the bicultural heritage of New Zealand. An office holder is supporting members to further include Māori language and culture in centre programmes and in their interactions with children.</p><p>Highly reflective practices are evident at all operational levels of the centre. All members are encouraged to evaluate the effectiveness of programmes and practices. This collaborative approach promotes shared understanding of the effectiveness of their work and the impact it has on children’s learning. It also promotes collective responsibility for direction setting and future development of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members have identified the following as key next steps for the playcentre:</p><ul>
<li>promoting further professional learning about infant learning and development</li>
<li>building on current work to further promote bicultural understandings.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Onehunga Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Onehunga Playcentre will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>20 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category.
