</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Forum North Childcare &amp; Education Centre is a small service situated in central Whangarei. It is owned by an incorporated society and managed by a committee of elected parents. The centre provides education and care for 26 children, including eight under two years old.</p><p>The centre is currently focused on its sustainability and possible relocation to another site. The staff and management are currently negotiating the centre’s future with the Whangarei District Council.</p><p>The centre is managed by an experienced supervisor. There are seven teaching staff; four of whom are qualified and registered teachers. High teacher to child ratios are evident.</p><p>The centre has recently been relicensed under 2008 Early Childhood regulations.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>There are positive relationships between teachers and children. The concept of extended family/whakawhānaungatanga is embedded in practice. Teachers know children and their whānau well. There is a calm atmosphere, which encourages high levels of tolerance and patience amongst children. Staff provide separate care for younger and older children in a warm and home-like environment. Children transition easily into the centre and are well supported in their progression to school.</p><p>Care for the under twos is underpinned by relevant theories. Resources are appropriate for this age group and freely accessible. Their emotional well being is effectively supported. Children’s transitioning into the over two area is sensitively managed.</p><p>Children are confident and competent learners. Opportunities are provided for children to play in mixed age groups. This promotes inclusive, caring tuakana/teina relationships. The children initiate their play and explore the learning environment and activities provided. Imaginative play is a feature. Children are encouraged to be independent and self managing.</p><p>The ‘Puriri Tree’ assessment and planning process helps teachers to identify children's interests. Teachers extend children’s learning through research and by providing additional resources. They model and encourage te reo me ona tikanga in culturally responsive ways. The commitment shown by the supervisor and staff have resulted in bicultural practices being well embedded in the programme.</p><p>The centre philosophy is annually reviewed. This is linked to the strategic plan and implemented through the annual management plan. A framework of policies guide centre operations, and these are regularly reviewed. There is good whānau involvement and support through the management committee.</p><p>Professional learning and development supports teachers to further develop their teaching and learning expertise.</p><p>The kaupapa/principles of the centre are strategically upheld by the supervisor and staff. Effective centre practices contribute to a collaborative teaching team that is focused on improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers, teachers and ERO agree that useful next steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>ensuring that the planning process results in an enriched curriculum for children</li>
<li>reviewing the quality of resources and how accessible equipment is to children</li>
<li>incorporating Tātaiako cultural competencies for teachers of Māori learners into performance appraisals</li>
<li>teachers supporting each other to maintain consistently high quality learning interactions with children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Forum North Childcare &amp; Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Forum North Childcare &amp; Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>27 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
