</table><p align="center" style="text-align: left;">Ohaupo Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ohaupo Playcentre is a parent-led education and care service located just south of Hamilton. It caters for children from birth to school age and operates three mixed-age morning sessions per week. The playcentre is licensed for 30 children including up to 15 children under the age of two years. The current roll of 42 children includes two who identify as Māori.</p><p>There has been a recent change of the leadership committee and a significant increase in younger children attending.</p><p>During 2018, the New Zealand Playcentre Federation transitioned from operating with 32 regional associations to become one national body with six regional offices. In the central north island, six associations have merged into a regional hub renamed Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island Region that now includes 95 playcentres over a large geographic area. At Ohaupo Playcentre the president is supported by a leadership committee, centre administrator and centre support worker provided by the Federation to assist with session operation.</p><p>Through their national philosophy, the playcentre places emphasis on whānau tupu ngātahi – families growing together. Adults and children are empowered to play, work and grow together and parents as first and best educators of their children.</p><p>Ohaupo Playcentre has a positive reporting history with ERO. The playcentre has made good progress addressing the recommendations as identified in the 2016 report.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 playcentre reviews in the Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s interests and strengths are recognised and valued. There is a large range of learning opportunities for children. Children are actively supported to develop their oral language, literacy and mathematical skills. The localised curriculum is underpinned by relevant activities, events and excursions. There is an inclusive approach to children's learning with additional support from a wide range of people within the community. Children under the age of two are well cared for in a nurturing environment that supports their individual development.</p><p>Children’s independence and self-management are well supported. The learning environment and resources support and extend children’s learning. Appropriate aged based challenges and activities that support mixed-age play are evident. Learning stories show children's progress and member's response to children’s interests. Children's portfolios as provide a useful documented record of involvement and learning.</p><p>Centre leaders have created a positive, inclusive and supportive culture. Recent changes to the leadership committee have focused on reviewing key aspects of the centre's daily operations. There is a growing understanding of self-review and which has informed new learning opportunities and a greater consistency of practice. The leadership committee have well developed induction processes for new members. Sound transition processes with the six local primary schools are in place. Parents fully support the playcentre philosophy and this contributes to children's positive learning experiences. The centre support worker and the centre administrator are building capability through appropriate feedback and feedforward. Their support and detailed reports are leading to improved awareness of quality practice.</p><p>The Playcentre Federation’s overarching strategic and individual annual plans guide playcentre direction. Good communication and support between the Federation and regions throughout the restructure has supported ongoing operations. The playcentre philosophy and vision and documented strategic goals have been set. There is now the need to measure the impact of these goals on outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To further support children's learning centre members should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop a consistent approach to the use of <em>Te Whariki</em> the early childhood curriculum in planning and evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve practice, the Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island regional leaders should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop and implement strategic and annual regional plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitor and strengthen the playcentre’s understanding of internal evaluation to inform ongoing improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support playcentre personnel to robustly report on the progress towards their appropriate strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen appraisal processes to support centre personnel and administrators to grow the practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ohaupo Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>19 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
