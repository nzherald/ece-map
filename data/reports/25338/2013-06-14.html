<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Background</span></h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Blossoms Educare Limited governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the May 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>adult interactions with children</li>
<li>assessment, programme planning, and evaluation</li>
<li>the learning environment, including provision for children&rsquo;s health and safety</li>
<li>employment practices including performance appraisal</li>
<li>self review and strategic planning</li>
<li>any other issues relevant to the management and operation of the centre that arise during the course of the review.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Blossoms Educare Limited is a privately owned centre in Wiri, near Manukau City. It has a focus on developing a high quality service for its multicultural community, and on increasing the participation of local children in formal early childhood education. Eighteen of the 49 children enrolled are of M&#257;ori descent and 24 have Pacific heritage. The staff team is also ethnically diverse. The licensee, supervisor and three other staff are registered teachers.</p><p>The centre is licensed to cater for 40 children, including up to 10 under the age of two years. Programmes and facilities for infants and toddlers under two years are provided in a separate building. Improvements are planned for the outdoor play areas.</p><p>ERO&rsquo;s 2012 report commented on the positive, caring relationships in the centre and on some good strategies used by teachers to engage children in play. However, management and programme development were at early stages of growth. The centre developed an action plan and has worked with external professional development providers to address the areas for improvement identified by ERO.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>The licensee and teachers have made progress since ERO&rsquo;s 2012 review. They have established a sound foundation of good practices to support further improvement in the quality of provision for children.</p><p>The centre has an inclusive, caring, family atmosphere. Teachers know children, families and the community well. They are committed to supporting wh&#257;nau, being responsive to their needs, and working with them to support children&rsquo;s learning. The environment celebrates the cultural diversity in the community. M&#257;ori and Pacific themes are especially visible. Some teachers use families&rsquo; home languages as they talk with children. Wh&#257;nau have contributed valuable information and help to support cultural events in the centre.</p><p>Children often work together cooperatively and positively, especially in self-directed imaginative family play. Toddlers benefit from spending much of their time in the outside play area with older children. These tuakana/teina interactions enable older children to be role models and leaders, and encourage them to care for younger children. Older children are able to explore a variety of play areas, resources and activities. Children make good use of the outdoor areas and use equipment flexibly to extend their play ideas.</p><p>Some teachers are particularly skilled at working quietly alongside children to support their play. They help children develop communication abilities through meaningful conversations. Teachers are learning how to guide children in developing skills for positive conflict resolution and negotiation.</p><p>Meal routines are flexible to promote children&rsquo;s independence and self management. Teachers encourage healthy eating and promote recycling to foster awareness of environmental sustainability. A vegetable gardening project over the past six months has supported these aspects of the programme and has helped strengthen connections between the centre and children&rsquo;s homes.</p><p>The quality of children&rsquo;s assessment records has improved. These portfolios are used by children and provide good information for wh&#257;nau about their children&rsquo;s development, involvement in the programme and relationships in the centre. A useful cycle of assessment, planning and evaluation has been established and as a result, the programme is becoming more purposeful.</p><p>The licensee and teachers are open to new learning and ways of thinking about early childhood education. Teachers are involved in professional development to help them improve the quality of their teaching. They are working with an external adviser to help strengthen their understanding of ways to support M&#257;ori children to experience ongoing success in education. Teamwork and communication amongst teachers has improved. The licensee provides professional leadership for teachers and is actively building their leadership capacity.</p><p>Teachers have begun to use systems and templates for self review. The licensee recognises that self review is in early stages of development. She is working with teachers to improve how appraisal and self review are used to raise the quality of teaching practice. The licensee has established effective annual management plans and is currently developing the centre&rsquo;s strategic vision and plan.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>The licensee and senior teachers recognise that self review should be strengthened at all levels of centre operation.</p><p>The following key next steps will help the centre to continue improving.</p><ul>
<li>The programme for infants and toddlers should be more closely supervised by a qualified teacher. The licensee and teachers should continue to review and improve the use of space and the quality and accessibility of resources for these children.</li>
<li>Children&rsquo;s assessment portfolios could be further developed to show teachers&rsquo; knowledge about individual children, including their language, culture and identity. Teachers&rsquo; partnerships with parents could be shown earlier in portfolios.</li>
<li>Teachers could now evaluate programmes in more depth with a focus on what they are learning about children and their own teaching practice. This deeper evaluation would provide more useful information to help teachers plan how they will support children&rsquo;s learning. It would also support a more purposeful programme of advice and guidance for teacher registration.</li>
<li>The licensee should continue supporting the development of stronger professional practice and curriculum leadership in the centre.</li>
</ul><p>Ongoing professional development for all staff will be necessary to support each of these developments.</p><p>The licensee and teachers should work together to maintain clean, uncluttered and inviting environments for children and staff. They should review and improve policies and procedures to ensure that these provide a clear guide for staff to provide well for children&rsquo;s health and safety.</p><a id="3-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>14 June 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Service</h2><table>
