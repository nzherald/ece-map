</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Wonders Early Childhood Centre provides full day education and care for children from three months to six years of age. There are five separate areas within the centre and children move from room to room according to their ages and stages of development. All teachers are either qualified or in training for qualifications.</p><p>The service is a privately owned company and is the first of eight Little Wonders Early Childhood Centres operating across New Zealand. The centre is managed by a centre manager together with team leaders in each of the five rooms. Company policies and procedures are regularly reviewed and amended as necessary through consultation with staff and families.</p><p>At the time of the 2010 ERO review, the centre had increased its roll and catered for up to 50 children. Since that review the centre has continued to grow rapidly and is now licensed for 110 children. Three new rooms have been built, new play areas have been established, and many new staff have been appointed. The cultural backgrounds of teachers reflect the centre and community’s multicultural diversity.</p><p>The company philosophy has been personalised for this centre and further reviewed by teachers and parents to reflect the culture of each individual room. These philosophies are very evident in centre programmes, relationships and culture of the centre.</p><p>The 2010 ERO report commented on the overall positive relationships between adults and children, the inviting learning environments and the wide provision of literacy opportunities for babies and children. These good practices remain features of the centre. The report also recommended the need to strengthen self review practices, and to continue to develop staff confidence to use te reo Māori in the programme. Managers and staff have worked together well to address these areas for improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Little Wonders Early Childhood Centre provides a calm, welcoming environment for children and their families. Respectful, positive relationships are evident between teachers, children and parents. Children settle quickly to play on arrival and confidently make choices about their play.</p><p>Teachers are caring and focused on providing positive outcomes for children of all ages. They work well together and frequently reflect on ways to improve what they do.</p><p>Good provision is made for babies and toddlers. The adoption of the Resources for Infant Educarers (RIE) philosophy of respect for children and freedom of movement is very evident in teachers’ interactions and relationships with infants and toddlers. Young children are well supported through a flexible curriculum that caters for individual routines and preferences.</p><p>In response to parent aspirations for children, the preschool room has a very strong focus on school readiness. Two primary trained teachers run the programme for 4 ½ year old children. Reading, writing and mathematics is taught during mat times and during the twice weekly formal preschool sessions. Some of this learning is linked to children’s interests. The centre ensures all children have visited a school and are familiar with school expectations of them.</p><p>Robust self-review practices are in place. Review is systematic, improvement focused and includes many perspectives. Formal and informal review is well documented and is personalised for each age group. Self-review and professional development has strengthened teachers’ understanding of biculturalism and increased their confidence to include te reo and tikanga Māori during the programme.</p><p>The centre has good systems to promote children’s safety and well being. Parents’ views are regularly sought and appreciated. Teachers are valued and provided with regular professional development and support. The teacher appraisal process is improvement focussed. Centre leaders agree they could appoint an external appraiser for the centre manager.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO discussed key next steps with the owner and team leaders. These included:</p><ul>
<li>further promoting open-ended questions to foster the development of children’s critical thinking and problem solving during play</li>
<li>using examples of well written learning stories in children’s portfolios as models to promote greater consistency of good teacher practice across the centre</li>
<li>reviewing the school readiness programme to better align it with Te Whāriki principles and best practice theory of early childhood learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Wonders Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice, centre managers should ensure that adult-to-child ratios for trips away from the centre are written on parent permission forms. Teachers should also better identify and document how they will respond to any emergency arising while on trips.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Wonders Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>31 October 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
