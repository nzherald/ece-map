</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sticky Fingers Childcare and Education Centre is a privately owned centre in Gisborne. The service provides all-day education and care for 60 children, including 25 up to two years of age. Of the 97 children enrolled, 41 identify as Māori.</p><p>This service consists of two centres on adjacent properties which operate under the same licence. One centre caters for infants and toddlers, and the other, for young children.</p><p>Since the November 2013 ERO report, a head teacher has been appointed who has responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the service. Two acting supervisors lead teams while permanent teachers are on leave.</p><p>In the previous report, ERO noted that assessment practices, educational success for Māori children and evaluation of curriculum required strengthening. These continue to require development. The non-compliance about police vetting of employees and contractors has been addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children actively engage in a welcoming and inviting environment. They are able to freely access a wide range of activities and resources that promote and extend their interests indoors and outside. Child-initiated group play is sustained for long periods. Excursions into the community extend the centre programme. Bicultural practice is evident in daily routines and teacher-child interactions.</p><p>Teachers are warm and welcoming, respectful and affirming in their relationships with children. A positive tone is evident in both centres. Teachers work collaboratively and responsively to encourage children's curiosity and creativity. Children with additional needs are well supported through individual development plans. Teachers work with outside agencies to support children and families, if required.</p><p>While well-presented portfolios document the activities children participate in, their developmental milestones and friendships, and some learning, planning for children's learning requires strengthening. Teachers should revisit the expectations outlined in the curriculum policy and better reflect these in their practice. They should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>be more responsive to children's interests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>better identify teaching strategies that extend children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>include regular evaluation of the impact of the planned programme on outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Responsive caregiving supports infants' and toddlers' needs for strong and secure attachments. Music and singing are used to enhance the programme. Teachers respond to young children's rhythms in a calm and unhurried manner throughout the day.</p><p>Promotion of educational success for Māori was identified in the previous ERO report as an area for development. This continues to require strengthening. Leaders and teachers should find out more about what this means in relation to the context of their service.</p><p>Leaders have identified that supporting teachers to extend their knowledge about educational success for Pacific children through familiarisation with the Pacific Education Plan is a next step.</p><p>A strategic plan is in place to guide centre operation for the next three years. An annual plan links to strategic goals and actions. Regular evaluation should be undertaken to measure progress in meeting goals each year.</p><p>Teachers are reflective and regularly make improvements to their practice. Continuing to develop their understanding of review and effective internal evaluation and ongoing monitoring of change and its impact on children is a next step. In addition, leaders should review internal evaluation guidelines to ensure they are up to date and sufficiently supportive of practice.</p><p>The policy on staff performance appraisal should be strengthened to reflect the following processes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>formal observations of teacher practice which relate to their identified goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly documenting all meetings including the dates and purpose</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>responsibilities of all involved in the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing clear, specific and measurable goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers evaluating the progress they have made against the agreed goal.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders should then monitor the effective implementation of this in practice.</p><p>Most policies provide explicit information to guide centre operation and practice. Leaders should familiarise themselves with these to ensure consistency of understanding and implementation within the teaching team.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that development steps should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a systematic process to guide internal evaluation that includes clear guidelines and expectations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the staff appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further developing understanding of educational success for Māori in this context</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving understanding of ways of working with Pacific learners.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The newly established leadership team should develop systems and processes to monitor improvements made as a result of ERO findings to ensure a continued focus on improving outcomes for all learners.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sticky Fingers Childcare and Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Sticky Fingers Childcare and Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>30 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
