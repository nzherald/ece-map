</table><p>Van Asch Deaf Education Early Intervention Centre is well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Van Asch Early Intervention Centre operates as an integrated part of the Van Asch Deaf Education Centre. The service caters for children from a wide geographical area. The diverse community includes pre-schoolers aged 0-to-6 years old who are deaf or hard of hearing, children of deaf adults, and siblings of deaf children. Teachers are also involved in regular residential courses run by Van Asch for pre-schoolers who are deaf and their parents. These courses are part of the wider provision of services under the Van Asch Deaf Education Centre.</p><p>The service philosophy gives emphasis to supporting children to become capable, confident communicators through the promotion of early intervention, language acquisition, family involvement, collaboration with other specialist services and best teaching practice.</p><p>All staff are qualified teachers with specialist training in early intervention and deaf education. The service places a strong emphasis on supporting parents to become effective communicators with, and first teachers of, their deaf children. Children usually attend one session per week.</p><p>Since the 2014 ERO review, there have been significant changes to the leadership and governance of the service. A new head teacher was appointed in 2015 and a new governance body was formed. The service is now governed by the Deaf Education ECE trust (which has oversight of both Van Asch Early Intervention Centre and Kelston Deaf Education Centre Preschool). A range of management functions is provided by the national Deaf Education Combined Board of Trustees. A new teaching team has sustained and built on the positive practices identified in the 2014 ERO report, and further developed understandings of tikanga Māori concepts and values.</p><p>Van Asch Deaf Education Centre is currently in the process of merging with Kelston Deaf Education Centre. Part of this process involves a nation-wide review of deaf education service delivery.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service philosophy is highly evident in practice. Strong, reciprocal and respectful relationships are formed with each family, supporting children's sense of wellbeing and belonging. Rich purposeful interactions between adults and children promote the valued outcomes for children. Aspects of te reo and tikanga Māori are meaningfully integrated.</p><p>Teachers actively foster learning partnerships with parents to improve and enhance the learning of children. Parents spoken with by ERO value the opportunities for parent education (including regular access to New Zealand Sign Language tutors), parent-to-parent support, and the access to specialist support.</p><p>The localised curriculum places emphasis on language acquisition, effective communication and responsiveness to the individual interests, strengths and needs of children. Teachers work collaboratively to provide detailed planning and assessment of children's learning to show progress of learning.</p><p>Teachers are reflective practitioners who critique their own practices through a process that is ongoing and intentional. They engage in robust appraisal and inquiry practices to build leadership capacity and teacher capability.</p><p>Leaders value and make good use of staff skills within and beyond the service. Skilled teachers work closely with staff from the Van Ash Deaf Education Centre, other health and education specialist agencies and early learning services.</p><p>Leaders purposefully align the service's annual goals to the Deaf ECE Trust Board and the Combined Board of Trustees' strategic priorities. Trustees are building their collective capability as governors and streamlining systems and processes. There is a clear focus across the service on the ongoing improvement of outcomes for children and families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified, and the service leaders agree, that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>clarify expectations for reporting to the ECE Trust Board on progress against strategic goals, philosophy and compliance with regulations</li>
<li>strengthen planned evaluation through the use of evaluative questions and valid indicators to be assured that the service is meeting its own effective practice expectations and valued outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>The service leaders have also identified, and ERO's evaluation has confirmed, that teachers need to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>understandings of how to effectively implement <em>Te Whāriki</em> <em>2017</em>, the NZ Early Childhood Curriculum</li>
<li>assessment practices, to provide meaningful assessment for all enrolled children, including children of deaf adults and hearing siblings of deaf children</li>
<li>te reo and tikanga Māori practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Van Asch Deaf Education Early Intervention Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice, leaders and teachers should regularly implement and document earthquake drills.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>19 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
