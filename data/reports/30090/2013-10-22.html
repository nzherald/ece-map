<a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Anglican Home Based Childcare Bay of Plenty Network 1B is managed by Waiapu Anglican Social Services (WASS) which acts as the umbrella organisation providing governance and support. WASS is undergoing restructuring at the management level, resulting in a time of change for the service. The service is based in an office in Whakatane. Network 1B is able to enrol up to 60 children from birth to school age. All educators in this network are qualified and have completed the first module of the Family Daycare Certificate. Educators are overseen by qualified and experienced visiting teachers.</p><p>The service aims to provide holistic early childhood education and care in supportive and nurturing home environments.</p><p>Children are settled and confident in experienced educators’ homes. Infants and young children receive responsive and respectful care that supports their development. Children benefit from experiences and interactions that foster their well being and learning in homes that are regularly checked for safety. They have opportunities to attend playgroups, gym and music sessions and planned trips into the wider community which foster their social skills and understanding of the wider world.</p><p>Māori children are confident in their culture. Aspects of te reo and tikanga Māori are included incidentally in some home and community environments. Māori educators are familiar with iwi resources and are able to support family and iwi links. Visiting teachers are developing their confidence to integrate aspects of Māori culture into the playgroup programme. Educators consult parents about appropriate use of other languages to support children’s ethnic heritages.</p><p>A number of visiting teachers continue to share responsibility for the network. They cooperate to contribute their strengths and knowledge to benefit educators and children. Visiting teachers meet monthly with educators to plan programmes and discuss individual children’s learning. The teaching team is supported by an experienced manager who maintains positive contact with educators.</p><p>Knowledgeable and enthusiastic educators prepare interesting and stimulating home environments for children. They involve children in everyday activities and use these as meaningful learning opportunities. Children have many experiences that foster their growing understanding of number, literacy and the wider world. Attractive individual portfolios contain photographs, learning stories and ideas for supporting and extending children’s interests and learning. These are shared frequently with parents and children.</p><p>The service has worked to support children as they prepare for transition to school. Visiting teachers and educators offer relevant and useful extension activities in homes and playgroups. Parents continue to manage school contacts and visits.</p><p>The 2010 ERO report highlighted the need to strengthen self-review practices and the Māori dimension in the service. Good progress has been made with increased equipment, documentation and visual displays that reflect Māori cultural values. Self review that contributes to the improvement and development of the service remains an area for ongoing development.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The service’s umbrella organisation, Waiapu Anglican Social Services (WASS), is currently restructuring at the management level. This has involved an extensive review of the organisation, and of Anglican Home Based Childcare. This restructuring has been a time of change and uncertainty for the service.</p><p>Since the ERO review in 2010, the manager and visiting teachers have remained the same. However, during the 2013 ERO review the role of the practice manager came to an end. In 2011, the Ministry of Education relicensed the network under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>. The service consulted with its community and reviewed its philosophy, policies and self-review systems as part of this process. The church hall in Opotiki has been significantly improved as a playgroup venue for visiting teachers, educators and children.</p><p>Visiting teachers have accessed appropriate courses and professional development to continue to develop their understanding of supporting positive outcomes for children in a home-based care setting. They have recently developed a framework to encourage educators to reflect on their practice.</p><p>Review officers visited three educators in their homes out of the 14 educators employed in this network.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><h5>Visiting Teacher Guidance</h5><p>Particular strengths of the experienced visiting teachers supporting this network include:</p><ul>
<li>positive communications, and trusting, respectful relationships with adults and children</li>
<li>interactions and learning conversations that engage children in play and extend their learning</li>
<li>collegial teamwork that demonstrates commitment to supporting educators, attending relevant professional development, and sharing knowledge.</li>
</ul><p>Visiting teachers and the service manager continue to maintain collegial and professional relationships as they share responsibility for the oversight of the networks and the professional support of educators.</p><h5>Programme</h5><p>Children participate in a rich variety of experiences and activities in the local and wider community that develops their social competency and leadership. They enjoy real-life experiences as they participate in a wide range of activities that increases their understanding of the world around them. Older children engage in creative and pretend play with younger children. Babies and toddlers are settled and confident. Educators visited in this network were fostering children’s knowledge of natural science as an important part of the programme. Parents and educators work in close partnership to maintain established routines for feeding and sleeping.</p><p>The network enhances the programme for children by providing weekly playgroups, gymnastic, and music and dance sessions. Children have many opportunities to become familiar with early concepts of literacy and number through meaningful games and activities. They are encouraged to draw, write, and enjoy stories and songs with their educators.</p><p>The transition to school policy identifies the particular skills children will need as they near school age. Children have many opportunities to visit with their local schools and share in sporting and cultural events. Educators commented that this enables many children to transition to school as confident participants with a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>Māori children are confident in their culture. Some educators use te reo Māori in meaningful interactions with the children. Educators and visiting teachers are developing their confidence to integrate aspects of Māori culture into the playgroup programme. In homes visited, ERO observed older children demonstrating tuakana-teina relationships as they take an active interest in the care and learning of younger children.</p><p>Visiting teachers meet formally with educators each month to discuss children’s interests, and plan the programme to build on current learning. They participate in the weekly playgroup and enjoy frequent additional opportunities to spend time with children and their educators. Visiting teachers and educators make regular contributions to the children’s profile books. Together they notice children’s interests, link them to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and show how they can be responded to. The attractively presented profile books make children’s learning and participation in the programme visible for parents and children to share and revisit. Whānau and parents are invited to contribute their views and observations to the profile books.</p><h5>Environments</h5><p>Homes visited by ERO were generally well-prepared and well-equipped. Educators provide unique, diverse and interesting environments for the children in their care. Visiting teachers regularly check aspects of health and safety in the home environment. Educators are supported by these checks and useful documentation to maintain their awareness of safe environments. Visiting teachers have recently focussed on educators’ preparedness for an emergency, and the development of plans and equipment to deal with such an event. Educators meet together and make good use of local parks, the river and the sea as important learning environments to extend children’s learning and interests. Children have many opportunities to adventure, explore and develop their physical confidence in these spacious natural environments. Visiting teachers plan outings for the educators and children to places of local interest. The service is generous in supplying educators with equipment and materials from a well-organised library of equipment and resources.</p><h5>Interactions</h5><p>Visiting teachers and the service manager continue to maintain collegial and professional relationships as they take shared responsibility for the oversight of the networks.</p><p>Children benefit from the close and caring relationships that educators have formed with parents, other educators, and visiting teachers. Interactions amongst adults and children are positive, respectful and affirmative. Babies receive nurture and affection, and are included alongside older children in homes, during outings and at playgroups. Older children enjoy communicating with other children and are involved in many conversations with educators, and at times with visiting teachers. These adults respond to children’s interests and ideas, providing them with information and asking questions that prompt thinking, investigating and sharing.</p><p>Children’s behaviour is guided positively by visiting teachers and educators. Their successes and contributions are acknowledged and valued. Educators know families well and are aware of the progress and development of children in their care. They have regular informal conversations with parents about children’s routines and care to support smooth transitions. Children quickly become confident and settled in educators’ homes, and enjoy their experiences in home and community.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>ERO and the service agree that important next steps are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>develop effective self review to continue improving the quality of the service and outcomes for children</li>
<li>strengthen the roles of management and leadership in strategic planning, performance management and quality assurance</li>
<li>develop the intentional use of teaching strategies based on current teaching theory and practice</li>
<li>enhance the service’s recognition of, and responsiveness to, the language culture and identity of individual children and their families</li>
<li>find ways to provide regular opportunities for parents to formally discuss learning and progress, and share their hopes and aspirations for their children with visiting teachers.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Anglican Home Based Childcare Bay of Plenty – 1B completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist.
