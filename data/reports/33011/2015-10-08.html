</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Huimai Playcentre is a rural service that provides education and care for 15 families with 23 children. Families are from Orini, Whitikahu, Tauhei, Te Hoe, Morrinsville and Gordonton. Since the previous ERO review in 2012, the number of sessions has increased. There are now four sessions per week for 0 to 6 year olds and one session per week for 3 to 6 year olds, which has been recently introduced to facilitate transition to school.</p><p>The centre operates as a parent cooperative under the umbrella of the Waikato Playcentre Association (WPA). The New Zealand Playcentre Federation and the WPA continue to provide effective governance and strategic direction for the centre. Members also benefit from the ongoing guidance and support of centre support workers, and adult education courses. This support and training is underpinned by the association’s philosophy <em>“Whānau tupu ngātahi -families growing together”</em>. The association’s commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi is evident in its bicultural leadership model, support for Māori whānau, and funding to support members to include te reo and tikanga Māori in learning programmes.</p><p>The playcentre is located in attractive and spacious grounds, which provide extensive outdoor play areas and a native garden for the children to explore. The philosophy of Huimai Playcentre emphasises parents and children learning together and building a strong sense of community. Playcentre philosophy and expected practices are evident throughout the programme.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six playcentre reviews in the Waikato Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Huimai Playcentre recognises parents as first educators, offering a setting which actively allows parents to take a positive and more confident role in the development and education of their tamariki. The centre’s vision and goals are driven by the parent community and emphasise positive outcomes for children. A sustained, long-term focus has achieved quality funding for this playcentre as more parents engage in playcentre training, with several achieving course four level.</p><p>Children benefit from respectful and reciprocal relationships in an environment where parents and families know each other well. A high ratio of adult-child interaction facilitates rich oral language and opportunities for extended play. Children are challenged to explore and solve problems. All resources are at child level to encourage and empower them to initiate their own play. There has been deliberate provision of resources that reflect te reo and tikanga Māori. Indoor and outdoor areas include opportunities for literacy and numeracy development within play. Children’s learning is made visible in wall displays and attractive individual portfolios.</p><p>The programme is child initiated and based on children’s interests, which are identified by parents and regularly reviewed. Learning is revisited in portfolios and booklets that depict special events. An example of this is the recent Matariki celebration that included a hangi for the playcentre community. This was supported by Puriri Whakamaru O Waikato and was an opportunity to learn tikanga practise and protocols. Regular trips are a feature of the centre. These are planned around children’s interests, and are intended to broaden the experiences of children who live mainly in the country.</p><p>A recent review of the provision for children under two has led to the designation of a comfortable area for babies, toddlers and their parents. They are able to explore resources appropriate to this age group. Similarly, self review has led to the resourcing of ‘the big kids session’, which is led by a qualified supervisor and aims to extend children’s literacy, mathematics and science concepts. Younger children have many opportunities to explore and interact with siblings and older children fostering tuakana- teina relationships.</p><p>Long serving members of the playcentre demonstrate effective leadership and have many connections with the local community. Leaders see the potential of new members and support, encourage and empower them to feel confident in accepting roles and responsibilities. Within this shared leadership model, there is a strong emphasis on pastoral care for all children and families.</p><p>Professional development is provided by the WPA on the basis of individual and centre requests. The Centre Support Worker (CSW) gives regular affirmation and advice when needed. This centre provides support for other play centres in developing their practices and processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>As a result of comprehensive and very effective self review, the playcentre members have identified the following areas for development and review:</p><ul>
<li>ongoing succession planning for leadership</li>
<li>continuing te reo and tikanga Māori development, building relationships with the local marae, and incorporating local context into the curriculum.</li>
</ul><p>ERO agrees with this direction and acknowledges that members are actively working towards these goals.</p><p>In addition, at WPA level there is a need to review and strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>CSW reports linked to licensing criteria and the strategic aims of this centre</li>
<li>the appraisal system for paid supervisors that includes a clear job description and specific feedback aligned to expectations for teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Huimai Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Huimai Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>8 October 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
