</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Queenspark is located in east Christchurch. This review was a part of a cluster of 11 kindergartens governed and managed by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO review, the teaching team, including the head teacher, has changed. The education service manager (ESM) has remained the same. She has provided consistent support to the different teaching teams and the community. The current teachers work well together. They are enthusiastic, strongly focused on providing positive outcomes and treat children and their families with respect.</p><p>Children’s sense of belonging is well supported through the transitions into and within the service and when they move to school. The head teacher has developed purposeful links with the neighbouring school to help foster successful transitions for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers actively foster positive relationships with children, parents and whānau. Children benefit from comforting and caring interactions with teachers. Teachers help children to develop confidence in themselves as capable, independent learners. They grow children's leadership skills. Children’s efforts and successes are acknowledged and celebrated. Teachers and children enjoy each other’s company and have fun together.</p><p>Teachers value the language, identity and culture of all children and their families. They work with families in sensitive and respectful ways.</p><p>Teachers and parents share information to support children’s wellbeing and learning at the kindergarten and at home. Parent views and contributions to the programme are appreciated by teachers.</p><p>Children are well supported to direct their own learning, and to contribute to decisions about the programme, resources and environment. Their views are respected and valued. Teachers are skilful in the ways they recognise and respond to children’s interests. There is a good balance between the excited buzz and the calm, settled hum of learning.</p><p>Teachers are very good at listening to children’s views and acting on them in thoughtful ways. They involve children in interactions and conversations that extend their comprehension and verbal language skills. Teachers encourage children to think more deeply and investigate their ideas.</p><p>Teachers provide a good selection of resources that reflect the context of children’s learning. They set resources up in ways that encourage children to make their own discoveries. Children are actively involved in a wide range of interesting experiences such as:</p><ul>
<li>imaginative play, creative activities and physical challenges</li>
<li>learning about the natural world and sustainable practices</li>
<li>increasing use of information and communication technologies.</li>
</ul><p>Literacy and numeracy are strongly promoted and woven into the learning programme. Children are very well prepared for school within the daily programme.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to learn about bicultural practices that are respectful and meaningful to the Māori culture. Teacher’s professional learning of te reo and tikanga Māori has been well used with children who are developing their own skills in this area.</p><p>The association is strongly focused on providing a consistent approach to building on, and supporting teachers’ professional practice. In particular, teachers are well supported in developing their understanding of te ao Māori and making this more evident in documentation and practices.</p><p>The association has high expectations for teaching and learning. The use of recently developed indicators is helping to identify and spread good practice. Appraisal is used effectively to recognise teachers' strengths and where further developments may be necessary to improve teaching and learning.</p><p>Leadership is a strength of the kindergarten. The ESM, head teachers and teachers have a shared understanding of, and commitment to, the kindergarten’s vision. They are making good use of systematic, planned approaches to self review.</p><p>Teaching practices are strengthened through well-targeted professional development. The strengths and interests of teachers are recognised and used well. Teachers are making very good use of kindergarten processes and practices to improve the quality of teaching and learning opportunities for children.</p><p>The association provides effective governance and management for all of its kindergartens. The long-term vision and goals for all kindergartens are determined by the governing board. Each individual kindergarten establishes its own plan incorporating the board's goals. The association responded appropriately to the circumstances of Canterbury and Westland communities by removing all fees.</p><p>Each kindergarten is supported by education support managers (ESMs) who make regular visits and provides well-targeted professional development. In particular, teachers are well supported in developing their understanding of te ao Māori and making this more evident in documentation and practices. This remains an area for further development in this kindergarten.</p><p>The association has high expectations for teaching and learning. The use of recently developed indicators of good practice is helping to identify and spread effective practice. Appraisal is used effectively to recognise areas of strength and where further developments may be necessary.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leaders and teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that they will continue to strengthen assessment, programme planning and evaluation documentation.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Queenspark completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Queenspark will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>18 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
