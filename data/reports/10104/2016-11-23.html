</table><p>Growing Minds Early Learning Centre needs support to improve the management of the centre and develop effective teaching practice.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Growing Minds Early Learning Centre is in Unsworth Heights on Auckland's North Shore. It caters for 43 children with up to 13 children under two years of age. The centre's philosophy places an emphasis on providing a learning programme based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The owner is the centre manager. She took ownership of the centre licence on the rented property shortly before the ERO review in 2013. As well as her management role she spends a lot of time teaching.</p><p>There are two distinct teaching spaces. The head teacher oversees the programme for the older children and a lead teacher oversees the programme for infants and toddlers. Some teachers work across both age groups.</p><p>A strong sense of belonging and positive teacher interactions were identified as areas of strength in the 2013 ERO report and are still evident. Areas for improvement identified in the 2013 report are still to be actioned.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and whānau generally experience encouraging relationships with kind and caring teachers. Children settle quickly into the programme with teachers working alongside them following their play experiences. Children would, however, benefit from more opportunities for creative and imaginative play. Access to a wider range of resources that offers them more variety and challenges would also be beneficial.</p><p>Teachers monitor infants and toddlers and interact with children and their whānau respectfully. Play as a vehicle for learning is appreciated and valued by teachers. It is now timely for teachers to develop strategies to build on children's learning and language development.</p><p>There is variability in the quality of teaching practice. For example children's play is often disrupted as teachers move them from play activities to centre routines. Teachers need to more frequently encourage and support children to extend their level of thinking through involving them in problem solving and making decisions about their learning.</p><p>Teachers notice children's interests, do collaborative planning around those interests and evaluate the programme weekly. There is an intentional focus on children's stages of development. Teachers should focus on the impact that their teaching strategies are having on children's learning and use this information to help them set their annual appraisal goals.</p><p>Older children enjoy the outdoor play environment. Many older children are able to overcome the challenge posed by the contour of the land. However, for some children, particularly younger ones, this issue limits their outdoor play opportunities for some children. This situation needs to be reviewed to ensure that infants and toddlers, can experience equitable outdoor learning opportunities.</p><p>The lead teachers in both rooms are experienced. They provide leadership to their teams and guide teachers through planning, assessment and evaluation. Together with the centre manager, they oversee the daily programme and maintain regular communication with parents. Leaders have identified the need to continue to build the capacity of teachers in order to provide a curriculum that is more responsive to the children.</p><p>Parents receive written stories about their childrens' learning at the centre and these are compiled in portfolios. The daily 'Learning Board' also gives parents immediate feedback on children at play. Information from the 'Learning Board' is often the starting point for stories that are included in children's portfolios. Parent's aspirations for their children are noted on enrolment and updated over time. Teachers could also link children's interests and dispositions to show their learning progress over time.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders acknowledge that there are areas of management that require urgent attention. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing clear roles and responsibilities for managers and leaders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in consultation with staff and whānau, reviewing the centre's philosophy, strategic plan and annual plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing and sustaining quality teaching and management practices to ensure positive learning outcomes for all children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Growing Minds Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing a child protection policy that meets the requirements of the <em>Vulnerable Children's Act 2014</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing suitable human resource management practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>conducting annual appraisal of staff based on the practising teacher criteria</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS31, GMA7</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Growing Minds Early Learning Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>23 November 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
