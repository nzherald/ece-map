</table><p>Bubbles Waitara requires further development of management systems and the delivery of teaching and learning programmes to be well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bubbles Waitara is a purpose-built, privately owned centre located in Waitara. It is one of seven services under the umbrella of Bubbles Limited and provides education and care for up to 60 children aged from three to five years. The centre operates between 9.00am to 4.00pm from Monday to Friday. Currently there are 28 Māori children on the roll. A bus purchased with Ministry of Education funding allows greater numbers of children access to daily sessions.</p><p>Centre owners are responsible for governance and management of the centre. A programme manager (PM), appointed in April 2014, is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the centre, with support from an operations manager. The PM also monitors the quality of curriculum provision and supports teachers’ ongoing professional learning and growth.</p><p>ERO's 2011 report identified a number of areas for development and review. The “Topclass” literacy and numeracy programme for older children continues to require review to link to current early childhood theories and practices. Teachers have accessed professional development to support strengthening bicultural awareness and aspects of teaching and learning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews in the Bubbles organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are busy, purposeful, active learners. Teachers increasingly support and encourage emerging interests and foster child-led inquiries and investigations. Early literacy and numeracy experiences are integrated meaningfully through the context of play. Learning and development are celebrated and shared between teachers and parents in informative portfolios and attractive wall displays.</p><p>Teachers focus on developing close partnerships between homes and the centre. They work collaboratively to establish a welcoming and inclusive environment in which children are first and foremost valued and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning.</p><p>Children are developing skills that support them as capable, confident lifelong learners. Teachers know children well. Children are encouraged to talk, listen and question during interactions with teachers and peers. Flexible routines, including at meal times, meet children’s needs and encourage self management.</p><p>Teachers acknowledge and value the cultural identity of Māori learners, linked to place and identity. Te aō Maori is becoming a meaningful part of children’s daily experience. Waiata, pepeha and the use of te reo Māori reflect curriculum priorities. A next step for teachers is to make use of <em>Ka</em> <em>Hikitia: Accelerating Success</em> and <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Māori Learners</em> to further enhance culturally responsive practices.</p><p>Children’s sense of belonging is paramount when settling into the centre and moving on to school. The service is successfully establishing positive relationships with local schools so that children’s confidence and capability at the centre transfers to the classroom at school.</p><p>Managing change to strengthen centre practices is a focus for the newly appointed PM. Her leadership is supportive and collaborative. Developing systems for planned and spontaneous self review promote ongoing reflection and improvement.</p><p>The service philosophy has not been recently reviewed. ERO agrees that philosophy review should include parents' aspirations and agreed curriculum and teaching practice.</p><p>The Bubbles 2014-to-2015 management plan requires strengthening. The focus of the plan is on centre operations and a broad teaching and learning objective for the seven centres. Consideration should be given to developing a plan collaboratively with teachers and parents that identies priorities and associated goals to strengthen individual centre operations. This should include governors and managers developing a better understanding of their respective roles and responsibilities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management should support teachers to continue developing and increasing shared understanding of formal, in-depth, evidence-based self review to enhance decision-making. Further development should include:</p><ul>
<li>strategic and annual planning to better inform centre priorities for teaching and learning</li>
<li>inquiring into the effectiveness and suitability of the formal “Topclass” literacy and numeracy programme for older children and how it aligns with relevant theories and practices in early childhood education.</li>
</ul><p>Further strengthening of the teacher appraisal processes to enhance outcomes for children should include:</p><ul>
<li>developing deliberate strategies for working towards achieving appraisal goals and clear links to relevant professional learning and development.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bubbles Waitara completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management and the provision of an effective early childhood education for children. To meet requirements the service needs to ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>the service is effectively governed and managed in accordance with good management practices, in particular strategic and annual planning. <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6, GMA7]</em></li>
<li>the practices of adults providing education and care demonstrate an understanding of children’s learning and development and knowledge of relevant theories and practices in early childhood education. This relates to the effectiveness and suitability of the formal "Topclass" literacy and numeracy programme for older children. <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008,C4]</em></li>
</ul><p>To improve current practice, centre management should make sure that all non-registered personnel, including managers and volunteers, are police vetted every three years.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bubbles Waitara will be within two years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><p>21 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
