</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Crawshaw Kindergarten, located in a residential suburb of Hamilton, is licensed for 40 children. The kindergarten offers both full and part-day education and care for children from two years to school age. At the time of this ERO review 39 children were enrolled, including 20 who identify as Māori.</p><p>The kindergarten is one of 29 kindergartens that operate under the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable trust. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement, ‘Our children are strong in heart, head and hand’. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. Advice, guidance and support is provided to the organisation by a kaumātua from Tainui.</p><p>All kindergartens in the WKA are involved in a ‘Cool 4 School’ transition programme and sustainable education, environment and health programmes such as Enviroschools and Sport Waikato 'Under 5 Energise'. The kindergarten's education, operational and administrative responsibilities are supported by experienced association personnel.</p><p>The kindergarten's philosophy states that 'learning, leadership and responsibility should be shared amongst teachers, parents, whānau, children and the community'. They believe that children come with their own ways on knowing, being and doing, and that whānau have aspirations for their children. Te Tiriti o Waitangi is honoured and valued to promote equitable opportunities for all children.</p><p>The teaching team is made up of two qualified and provisionally registered part-time teachers, and a full-time experienced head teacher. The head teacher has held her position for two years. The kindergarten has responded positively to the last ERO report, internal evaluation systems and processes have improved and partnership with parents in their child’s learning is more visible.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three reviews in the Waikato Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive relationships with children and their whānau are valued and well promoted by teachers. Children's language development is fostered through rich conversation, using open ended questions that provide oral language support. Teaching strategies linked to social competency are used to support all children’s engagement and participation in the environment. Partnerships between the kindergarten and home supports children’s learning.</p><p>Children experience a curriculum that promotes wellbeing and a sense of belonging for all. The programme is focused on children making choices, being confident and experiencing many opportunities for sustained play. The environment is large and spacious and allows for all children to lead their own learning and to manage risks and challenge. Regular visits and excursions enrich the curriculum, children’s learning, and sense of self. Literacy and numeracy is authentically woven throughout play, it is visible and acknowledged. Children are confident and are curious about the world around them.</p><p>Teachers have good knowledge of children as learners. An inclusive environment is effectively promoted. Children with additional needs and English as a second language are well supported, including children with Pacific heritage. Transition into and out of the service is flexible, individual and supports the emotional wellbeing of the child through the support of key teachers. Children’s abilities, needs and interests inform planning for learning, and assessment builds a picture of what children know, are interested in and can do. There is now a need for teachers to develop consistent expectations of assessment. The inclusive environment supports children to experience a wide range of learning opportunities.</p><p>Māori learners are supported to achieve success as Māori. A bicultural curriculum has been developed and is visible and valued. Tuakana-teina relationships are actively promoted across the programme and evident in play and learning. Children are supported to make connections to the unique heritage of Aotearoa, New Zealand.</p><p>Leaders create a positive, collaborative and respectful culture for teaching and learning. The head teacher is coaching and supporting the new teaching team through the process of appraisal to grow their capability. This process needs strengthening to support teachers to build their knowledge around teaching and learning. The philosophy has been recently reviewed and links to <em>Te Whāriki.</em> The philosophy now needs to be further reviewed in consultation with the new team and the community to clarify their values and beliefs for high-quality education. There is a strong alignment between the kindergarten's annual plan and internal evaluation which is responsive and informs change. Leaders promote a strong advocacy for children and their learning.</p><p>Education services managers (ESMs) work closely with the head teacher and provide well-informed professional leadership to support kindergarten operation. The WKA has recently reviewed its teacher appraisal process. Ensuring this new process is fully implemented is a priority for ESMs.</p><p>The WKA provides comprehensive systems, policies and procedures to guide kindergarten practice. Teachers have access to ongoing and targeted professional development to promote improved practice and contribute to positive outcomes for children. Effective governance by the WKA is contributing to inclusive and equitable services for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next step for leaders is to prioritise building teachers' knowledge and understanding of the centre's expectations for teaching and learning. This will include undertaking targeted observations of teaching practice and implementing a strong coaching and mentoring process.</p><p>There is a need for teachers to develop a stronger focus on children’s individual planning, assessment and evaluation by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clearly documenting children's learning to further support parents' understanding of their child's progress</p>
</li>
<li>continue to strengthen children’s language, culture and identity and ensuring the visibility of this within the programme.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Crawshaw Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Crawshaw Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>20 December 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
