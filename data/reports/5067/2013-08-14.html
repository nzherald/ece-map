</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mangere Bridge Kindergarten is situated close to the Manukau Harbour and Mangere Mountain and sits within a multi-cultural community. It is licensed for 40 children over two years of age and operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA). The association provides policy, procedural and operating guidelines. It also provides teachers with regular, topical professional development and on-going support from professional managers.</p><p>In May 2013 the kindergarten changed from being a sessional kindergarten to opening for longer hours under the ‘Kindergarten Day Model.’ It now has four teachers, and a part-time administrator. Significant work has been done by teachers to successfully manage the recent change to the Kindergarten Day Model.</p><p>The kindergarten’s philosophy places priority on developing strong partnerships between teachers, children, families and the community. Teachers firmly believe that children learn through play and provide experiences that bring this philosophy into practice. They are currently involved in a research project about how children learn in more than one language.</p><p>The kindergarten has a very positive reporting history with ERO. Since the 2010 ERO review teachers have sustained the high quality practices identified by ERO and have maintained a focus on continuous improvement. Through their engagement in ongoing research and professional development they have continued to enhance the quality of education provided. Parents and whānau continue to have a strong sense of partnership with, and pride in, the kindergarten.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Mutually respectful relationships and good communication between teachers, children and their parents underpin kindergarten operations. Teachers value the strengths that children and their families bring to the kindergarten. Teachers have an in-depth knowledge of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, and value child-led learning. They celebrate children’s cultural diversity and nurture each child’s home language, culture, and identity. Teachers’ commitment to using te reo and tikanga Māori and their respect for Māori as tangata whenua are positive features of the kindergarten.</p><p>Teachers provide a high quality programme in which children are actively engaged in learning. They integrate literacy, numeracy, science and information communication technologies (ICT) naturally into the programme. Creativity through the arts is valued. Participation in Enviroschools and the Kindergarten at the Farm programmes add to the centre’s rich curriculum and promote children’s understanding of the natural world, sense of adventure and physical development. Effective planning systems reflect how children’s interests guide the programme.</p><p>Children play cooperatively and are curious and imaginative. The stimulating well resourced environment enables them to try things out, problem solve and pursue emerging interests through their play. Teachers’ timely interventions support children to persevere, take risks and develop resilience. Children have sustained conversations with teachers and each other. They are capable confident learners, with a strong sense of belonging, who show care and empathy for others.</p><p>Providing good support for children’s transition to school continues to be an integral part of teachers practice and an area of ongoing community leadership and research. Work in this area is supported by weekly visits to the kindergarten by children from local schools.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively and have a high level of understanding of current early childhood approaches and trends. They benefit from the strong professional leadership of the head teacher and AKA personnel. The appraisal process supports teachers to share strengths and leadership opportunities. Children and their families’ close connections with teachers enable them to share skills and be leaders in the kindergarten.</p><p>Teachers use self review to guide continuous improvements to kindergarten programmes and operations. They review and make changes in consultation with children, parents, whānau and the community. The annual plan is used effectively as a guide to implementing the strategic plan and progress against annual and strategic goals is regularly reviewed. Teachers have a well established culture of being a community of researchers and learners.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teaching team is eager to continue researching further ways to:</p><ul>
<li>reflect children’s language, culture and identity in their assessment portfolios</li>
<li>enhance transition to school practices and their partnerships with the community.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mangere Bridge Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h3>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h3><p>The next ERO review of Mangere Bridge Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>14 August 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
