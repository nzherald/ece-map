<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>This centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children and their parents. The governing trust is focused on ensuring the ongoing sustainability of this centre and maintaining the philosophy and effective centre practices.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Karanga Mai Early Learning Centre is a service of the Waimakariri Community Development Trust (trading as Wellbeing North Canterbury). It provides care and education for children aged from birth to five years. The majority of families enrolled in the centre are young parents who are continuing with their secondary education at the Karanga Mai Young Parent College. Families from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds attend the centre. Some children and their parents have to travel substantial distances to attend the college and early learning centre. The trust and Young Parent College provide transport which is essential for children and their parents to access these facilities.</p><p>The centre is organised into two areas (homebases). One area is for very young babies and the other area is for more mobile toddlers and older children. A senior teacher oversees the daily operation of the centre. The Assistant Head Teachers in charge of each homebase are also part of the centre leadership.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers actively promote a curriculum that focuses on building effective relationships. Teachers have positive and affirming interactions with parents. They know the children and their families well, and use this knowledge to help them relate to children in meaningful ways. Children show a strong sense of belonging in the centre.</p><p>Parents' contributions are regularly sought and responded to effectively by teachers. Teachers ensure they have good opportunities to talk with parents about their child&rsquo;s learning and development. They provide useful advice and guidance to parents to support them in their parenting.</p><p>The centre has developed a range of practices that ensure a focus on positive outcomes for M&#257;ori children. These include teachers:</p><ul>
<li>respectfully acknowledging te Ao M&#257;ori</li>
<li>using Ministry of Education resources to further their understanding of supporting M&#257;ori children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>using staff strengths and skills in te reo and Tikanga M&#257;ori to enhance the bicultural aspects of the programme</li>
<li>valuing the input of wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>promoting the natural environment as a learning resource.</li>
</ul><p>Cultural diversity is acknowledged and celebrated. Teachers make good use of the information families share with them to nurture children&rsquo;s sense of identity. Pacific children benefit from the knowledge, experiences and wh&#257;nau connections of some teachers at the centre and strong links between the centre and Pacific education community.</p><p>Teachers place considerable emphasis on helping children when they first start, as they move onto other areas of the centre, and when they leave the centre (transitions). They recognise the importance of supporting children&rsquo;s emotional wellbeing and belonging, especially when they are learning to develop relationships with other teachers. Transitions are flexible, acknowledging the developmental needs and preferences of individual children. Successful transitions are supported by effective partnerships between families and teachers.</p><p>Infants' wellbeing and learning is well supported. Teachers consistently spend time playing with infants on the floor at their level, talking with them, smiling and encouraging their movement and exploration. Teachers interact with very young babies in respectful and nurturing ways. They take care to create an environment that is inviting, interesting and effectively supports infants&rsquo; development and social and emotional needs.</p><p>The Assistant Head Teachers in charge of each homebase provide strong leadership. They:</p><ul>
<li>are good role models of high quality interactions, and meaningful assessment</li>
<li>are knowledgeable about good practice in early childhood education</li>
<li>have an in-depth understanding of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the Early Childhood Curriculum, and how this influences the programme provided.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are particularly skilled at recognising children&rsquo;s learning habits such as persevering, concentrating and becoming involved. Sharing this information among teachers is contributing to the ongoing development of the programme to better support children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>The senior teacher has led a review of the teacher appraisal process. This has resulted in the development of a new appraisal process that incorporates the registered teacher criteria. The next step is to successfully introduce and make effective use of the new approach to provide teachers with meaningful feedback on their teaching practice.</p><p>Teachers have been recording changes they have made to the programme in response to what they notice about the children. The next step is to ensure that their planning, assessment and self-review practices clearly evaluate outcomes for children and their learning.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s strategic plan needs improvement. It is unclear if the current plan is useful for identifying priorities and associated goals, and guiding the strategic direction of the centre. The next step is to ensure the trust has plans in place to maintain the balance between sustainability and positive outcomes for children.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Karanga Mai Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select &lsquo;have&rsquo; or &lsquo;have not&rsquo; taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the onsite stage of the review ERO identified several areas where centre practices could be improved. These included:</p><ul>
<li>being clearer about the safe handling of hot drinks in the play areas</li>
<li>developing effective systems to identify hazards</li>
<li>extending the environment checks undertaken</li>
<li>ensuring parents sign approval for ratios for excursions</li>
<li>reviewing the storage of some items to ensure these are not risks in the event of an earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>During the review the senior teacher developed new systems to address these areas. ERO recommends that the next step is for the teachers to successfully implement and maintain these new procedures over time.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>25 October 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
