</table><p>Puna ole Malamalama Aoga Amata does not currently have an active management board. In previous times the board had played an active role in the day to day running of the centre. However, at the time of the review the management board had been inactive for some time. This is a result of a decision made by the church members of the Addington Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) to transition to a new governing body. While consultation about this change has taken place the centre manager and staff have yet to fully understand what these changes will be for the centre. As a result, a contact person, centre manager and management committee has yet to be appointed.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Puna ole Malamalama Aoga Amata is an early childhood centre that operates under the umbrella of the Addington Samoan Seventh Day Adventist Church. After the 2008 ERO report, the Ministry of Education placed the centre on a provisional license with a number of conditions in place that the centre had to meet. Consequently, since that time the Education Review Office has not reviewed the centre. Once the centre was restored to a full licence in August 2015, ERO scheduled a review for 2016.</p><p>Recent staff changes to the centre include a supervisor and one new teacher in the over two area. Altogether there are four qualified early childhood teachers. ERO notes that the centre licence doesn't accurately identify the current contact person.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>At the time of the review the Addington Samoan Seventh-day Adventist Preschool Trust were planning to transition all governance responsibilities to the South New Zealand Seventh-day Adventist Education Trust 2004 by the end of 2016. This would include the establishment of a management committee that would support the centre's strategic direction and the day to day operations. Despite these plans, currently management systems and operations are ad hoc and ineffective.</p><p>While there is a lack of clear and robust management processes, it is evident that teachers work hard to provide a learning programme for children that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>is nurturing and caring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>notices, recognises and responds to children's individual needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provides children with a variety of learning experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>include aspects of literacy and numeracy in children's play.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The Samoan teachers use Samoan language consistently and support the non-Pacific teachers to use appropriate Samoan phrases and to develop their understanding of Gagana Samoa. This provides rich opportunities for children to develop their receptive and spoken Samoan language in an environment where Samoan culture is celebrated.</p><p>Children are familiar with routines and enjoy positive interactions with teachers and each other. Teachers support them to develop appropriate self-management skills and children show good independence.</p><p>Teachers know children and families well. When children arrive they settle in quickly. Parents and teachers share warm, friendly relationships that make it possible for them to discuss important information about children's learning preferences and dispositions.</p><p>Children's learning is documented in portfolios that are available to parents at all times, and teachers encourage parents to contribute information about their children and their aspirations for their learning. Teachers recognise the learning children are doing in their play.</p><p>Children move freely between indoor and outdoor play areas. There is spacious provision for the younger children. Teachers work well together to meet children's needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To support teachers to promote and sustain effective teaching practices they should continue to share good practices and participate in ongoing professional development. This may include professional development focussed on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening opportunities for children to experience more problem solving and complex play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessing and annotating children's work to identify the new skills they are developing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing and implementing a robust process of self-evaluation that helps teachers to identify what is working well and what needs to be improved.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>At the time of the ERO review there were no effective governance and management practices in place. The recently appointed supervisor, acting board chair and staff were in the process of understanding the proposed changes to the centre governance. Consequently, the governance and management must ensure that they:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>finalise and formalise with the Ministry of Education the centre's contact person and inform parents accordingly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement a robust appraisal process which is understood by staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and implement a strategic and annual plan developed with management, staff and parents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the centre's philosophy and how well this is understood and being enacted by staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review all centre policies to ensure that they reflect legislative requirements and current centre practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and implement a robust process of self-evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>establish and implement effective management support for staff and parents</li>
<li>implement management roles and responsibilities as outlined in the SNZSDA Education Trust 2014 document so that the trust board will be kept well informed about how the centre staff are complying with the conditions of the licence.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Puna ole Malamalama Aoga Amata completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance to ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>all aspects of health and safety requirements are addressed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>parents are informed of the centre's audited accounts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the centre meets all requirements of police vetting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the centre meets all requirements of the Vulnerable Children's Act</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Ministry of Education is advised that the contact person has been changed</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS6, 13, 14, 17, GMA3, 7A, Regulation35.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Puna ole Malamalama Aoga Amata will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>13 July 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
