</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Rotorua East operates under the umbrella of Kidicorp Ltd, which provides overall strategic direction and comprehensive systems to manage centre operations. The centre is an all-day, mixed age education and care service that is licensed for 36 children, including up to 10 children under the age of two years. Currently 28 of the 37 children attending are identified as Māori.</p><p>The centre is located in a converted house. Parents and teachers have worked together to develop the outdoor playgrounds to feature edible plants and interesting areas where children play in a natural environment. Recently Kidicorp Ltd has introduced a transport service designed to maintain children’s regular attendance.</p><p>Since the last ERO review the centre has experienced a change in ownership, as new manager has been appointed as the centre leader, and there has been a change in teaching staff. The centre has improved its self review processes as recommended in the 2011 ERO review.</p><p>The recently reviewed centre philosophy aspires for children to ‘be valued as unique individual learners capable of taking a risk and being independent’. They aspire for children to learn in a ‘nurturing, stimulating programme and environment’ where their learning and care needs are met.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience respectful, responsive relationships in an interesting, well-resourced environment. Their identity is recognised through their family stories which are prominently displayed. Children also hear and use te reo Māori in conversations, waiata, and karakia at kai time. They know that they are free to make choices and follow their interests. Children are taking responsibility for their learning and using resources in creative ways.</p><p>Babies and toddlers are cared for with individual routines that are familiar from home. Teachers nurture and support children to explore freely, encouraging their independence and self-help skills. These younger children enjoy playing with their older siblings who include them and look after their wellbeing. Babies and toddlers are learning to be confident, competent learners who communicate knowing that their teachers, and also their peers, will respond to their words and non-verbal signals.</p><p>Teachers welcome children and their families into the centre’s warm, inclusive environment. They know children well and interact with them through many conversations, asking open questions to prompt them to share ideas and develop their thinking. Literacy and numeracy are a natural part of the programme. Teachers read many stories, including local myths and legends. They foster children’s enjoyment of books, and encourage their interest in experimenting creatively with art and writing materials.</p><p>Teachers are increasingly including parent’s aspirations for their children in their programme planning. Parents are well-informed about their children’s learning through displays, individual profiles, and conversations with teachers. The centre is currently reviewing the planning cycle, and teachers are making changes to increase their capacity to respond to children’s changing learning and development needs and abilities.</p><p>Teachers’ professional knowledge has benefited from ongoing learning and development and guidance from Kidicorp Ltd managers. Teachers engage in discussion and reflection about their teaching practice to share successes and seek new ideas.</p><p>The centre manager places priority on maintaining a centre climate that welcomes children and parents, and promotes a sense of belonging. She has led an in-depth review that established a collaborative staff team with a strong sense of commitment to children’s learning and wellbeing. With the support of the teaching team and external specialists, the manager has also ensured that children with additional learning needs have been well catered for and included.</p><p>Area leaders know the centre well. Kidicorp managers have assisted the centre through a period of change. They provide appropriate leadership for centre leaders and teachers, with a strong focus on improving the quality of education and care. This close professional oversight has supported programme development, relationships with parents, self review, and the capability of the teaching team.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers agree that the next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to strengthen the links between planning and assessment, so that children’s learning and progress can be identified and supported.</li>
</ul><p>The centre has identified, and ERO agrees, that this initiative is valuable for its potential to strengthen the links between planning and assessment, and the evaluation of outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Rotorua East completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Rotorua East will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>28 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
