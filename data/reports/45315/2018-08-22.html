</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Kiwis Playhouse Early Learning Centre provides full-day and sessional education and care for up to 16 children over two years of age. The centre serves a multicultural community in Three Kings, with many of the children from families who have recently immigrated to New Zealand. The centre was purchased by the current owner in 2015.</p><p>The centre's philosophy has recently been reviewed and the educational approach now reflects the teachings of Maria Montessori. Teachers have made changes with the support of professional learning and development and they have also purchased relevant resources.</p><p>The centre manager manages a group of eight centres. She is supported by a centre supervisor who provides leadership for three other registered teachers and support staff. Further professional leadership is provided by a registered teacher who works across the owner's group of centres.</p><p>This is the first ERO review since the change of ownership and management of the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from learning in a calm, respectful environment. They are well supported to develop a sense of identity and belonging. Children experience positive interactions with their teachers and with one another. Teachers know the children and their families well. They are often able to talk with children in their home languages while supporting them to develop their communication in English.</p><p>The centre philosophy is reflected in the programme and in the approach taken to learning and teaching. Children are viewed as capable learners, and teachers encourage them to manage their own play and to follow their interests. The centre's commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi is evident in the environment and in aspects of the curriculum in action. Teachers regularly use te reo Māori with children.</p><p>Children learn within the framework of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. At the same time, the centre is appropriately resourced to reflect the Montessori approach to teaching and learning. Effective processes guide teachers' assessment of children's learning and their planning for relevant learning opportunities. Teachers observe children's play, giving them time to make their own decisions and to initiate conversations. They share this information with parents through learning stories, and record their planned responses to promote further learning.</p><p>The centre is well staffed with a high ratio of teachers to children. Teachers work well as a team to support children and to grow professionally. The manager provides relevant professional learning opportunities, and the appraisal process is improvement focused.</p><p>The centre regularly uses internal evaluation to support ongoing improvement. The centre manager could consider using evaluative questions to guide investigations into the effectiveness of centre practices. When an area for development is identified, it could be included in the centre's strategic and annual planning to guide the actions taken to bring about improvement.</p><p>Centre staff work inclusively in partnership with parents. Teachers encourage parents to share their cultures with children through the programme. They help parents to understand the intentions of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, and how to support their children as they transition to school.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager acknowledges that the outdoor area needs redevelopment, and planning for this has begun. Centre managers/leaders agree that other next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation and strategic planning to identify and plan for ongoing centre improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>auditing policies and procedures to ensure that a comprehensive set of current policies is available to parents and staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to encourage parents to contribute to the assessment of, and planning for, their children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Kiwis Playhouse Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice, the manager should ensure that there are more robust systems in place to ensure that staff identify and address all health and safety matters in a timely fashion.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Kiwis Playhouse Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>22 August 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
