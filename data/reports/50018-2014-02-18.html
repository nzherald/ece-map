</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hawera Playcentre is one of 17 parent-led services under the umbrella of the Taranaki Playcentre Association (the association). The governance of these centres has recently reverted to a structure where all centre representatives contribute to association decisions and priorities. An association management team provides support to centres for their day-to-day running.</p><p>This service provides mixed-age sessional education and care for children from birth to six years, three mornings a week. Playcentre philosophy focuses on children learning together with their parents through play. The playcentre president has been in the role for a year.</p><p>Association support personnel regularly visit the centre to encourage and assist parents in their role as educators. They provide advice and guidance for bicultural, centre and property matters. Positive relationships between the playcentre and those in support roles are evident.</p><p>Since ERO’s 2010 report, physical changes have occurred within the environment to ensure that licensing requirements and the needs of young children and their whānau are met. A particular focus in 2013 has been the redevelopment of the area for infants and toddlers to improve comfort, convenience, safety and inclusiveness.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 14 reviews in the Taranaki Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Parent members work collaboratively to actively support infants', toddlers' and young children’s learning in their individual and group play activities. Children’s acknowledged interests are clearly recorded and displayed so that all members can contribute to and support each child’s learning.</p><p>Children play together and independently for sustained periods. Resources are easily accessed by children. Parents ensure that a wide variety of play materials is available to support children’s selfdirected play choices. Members focus on four different areas of play each term to consider how they might be used optimally to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Educators have positive and responsive relationships with children. These support children’s wellbeing and exploration. Adults converse with children and ask questions to encourage dialogue. The environment is responsive to the needs and inclinations of infants and toddlers and supports their increasing engagement with the world around them. Adults are alert to young children’s non-verbal cues. Children’s sense of wellbeing and belonging is demonstrated through the confidence with which they explore and engage in play.</p><p>Portfolios document children’s active participation in playcentre activities. Adults regularly record the activities children engage in during the sessions. This information contributes to joint planning at the beginning of each term.</p><p>Ongoing support is needed to continue to develop assessment, planning and evaluation practices. The association has planned professional development for 2014 on planning and evaluation. ERO's evaluation supports this focus to assist the service to more effectively implement current and useful approaches to assessing and planning for children’s learning.</p><p>Playcentre members are aware of the need to focus on improvement and are at an early stage of understanding how self review can assist them with this. The association overall is at a very early stage in its understanding of self-review processes and practices that focus on teaching and learning. This was a recommendation in the 2010 ERO report and still needs addressing.</p><p>ERO recommends the association strengthen self review. Support should be given to Hawera Playcentre members to develop ways of knowing the impact of its services on children’s learning and development, and the quality of the educational programmes.</p><p>Hawera Playcentre and the association have annual plans that inform operational decisions. However, there are few links between the association and individual playcentre goals. The association’s strategic vision is yet to effectively focus on priorities for improving teaching and learning.</p><p>Puriri W’akamaru o Taranaki is a role established by the association to build bicultural understandings. Acknowledged next steps are to develop strategies and approaches to effectively promote Māori children’s success as Māori. While some efforts are being made to ensure a bicultural presence at the centre, members are aware of the need to build parent's confidence to use te reo Māori in and around the playcentre.</p><p>Members willingly take on leadership roles. Office holder roles are held for up to three years with thought given to succession planning as families move through the service. Most parents are working towards attaining playcentre qualifications through education training courses offered by the association.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Playcentre leaders are aware of the continuing need to improve and develop their understanding in:</p><ul>
<li>self review focused on teaching and learning to show the impact of adults' practices on outcomes for children</li>
<li>bicultural practice, especially increased use of te reo Māori</li>
<li>opportunities for Māori children to succeed as Māori</li>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation focused on children’s learning.</li>
</ul><p>The association would benefit from external support to strengthen and improve its understanding of:</p><ul>
<li>annual and strategic planning that better informs priorities for teaching and learning</li>
<li>relevant approaches to assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>fostering opportunities for Māori children and whānau to have success as Māori</li>
<li>supporting members' understanding of teaching and learning and regulatory requirements</li>
<li>self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hawera Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hawera Playcentre will be in three years.<img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>18 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
