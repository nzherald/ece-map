</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ezekiel Trust Community Kindergarten is governed by a management committee that is part of the Ezekiel Trust which offers a range of additional community ministries. The centre is located in the Morrinsville Baptist Church complex in the central township and caters for children from Morrinsville and surrounding rural areas. It offers half-day sessions for a mixed age-group of children between two and a half and school age, and an all-day session on Wednesdays for four year olds. There are 57 children enrolled, including four children who identify as Māori.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review the centre has been extensively refurbished and the outdoor playground has been remodelled. Teachers have responded positively to the next steps identified in the 2013 report. They have extended their self-review processes and refined assessment, planning and evaluation practices. The centre has also made good progress in including Māori perspectives in the kindergarten programme and practices.</p><p>The centre is led by an experienced supervisor, who is supported by long-serving teaching and support staff. Two of the three staff are fully qualified. The centre includes children from a variety of backgrounds and cultures.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy is strongly based on Christian teaching and values, supporting children to develop a sense of themselves as unique and special. The centre fosters children's development of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>healthy reciprocal relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>confidence and social competence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>independence and resilience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ability to work cooperatively.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The kindergarten aims to operate as a community of learners, creating strong learning foundations that enable children to experience continuity of learning and successful transitions to school.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy positive, caring and calm relationships with their teachers within a family-like environment. They are able to independently access a wide variety of outdoor and indoor resources. Their interests and contributions to the programme are respected and valued. Children are engaged in activities for sustained periods, showing concentration and persistence with authentic and meaningful learning experiences and activities.</p><p>Children are encouraged to care for and respect the kindergarten and wider environment. They are encouraged to be independent self-managers. Teachers support them with constructive positive guidance and help them to develop negotiation and problem solving skills. Children are friendly and confident with adults, communicate well and interact positively with one another.</p><p>Teachers include tikanga and te reo Māori as a natural part of the programme. They use te reo in their interactions with children. They introduce them to a range of resources and experiences related to Te Ao Māori, such as waiata, karakia, and through their participation in the local cultural festival.</p><p>Teachers' common beliefs and commitment to the special Christian Character underpins their professional practice and relationships with each other, the children, and their families. They bring extensive and relevant knowledge, skills and experience to their teaching and learning. Teachers engage in professional learning and development to enhance their teaching strategies and practices.</p><p>Features of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>inclusion of oral language, literacy, mathematics, and the arts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>availability of resources and activities that incorporate everyday life skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deliberate teaching of Christian values and beliefs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>experiences of the local and natural environment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers' record children's involvement and learning in individual portfolios. Parents/whānau are encouraged to visit the portfolios, and contribute information about children's home interests. The kindergarten invites families to share their aspirations for their children. Teachers include these expectations in their programme and inform parents of the outcomes for their children.</p><p>The supervisor promotes the special Christian character of the kindergarten and role models high standards of professional practice. As the professional leader, she has established a culture in which children are first and foremost valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are, and what they bring to their learning. She leads a collaborative, collegial and effective team.</p><p>The supervisor supports staff through mentoring and the appraisal process to grow their knowledge and capability. She welcomes and includes parents as partners who contribute to their children’s learning. She seeks feedback and organises events for parents to join in aspects of the programme. The supervisor reports regularly to the Kindergarten Management Committee and represents the kindergarten on this committee. Through self review, she brings about continuing improvements to the kindergarten’s capacity to provide the best outcomes for children.</p><p>The kindergarten is well supported by the Ezekiel Trust and the wider church community. The kindergarten committee maintains communication with the Ezekiel Trust and works closely with the supervisor to maintain the vision, values and philosophy</p><p>The kindergarten is currently engaged in a consultative process to develop a strategic plan that reflects its vision and values. This document has the potential to align all aspects of centre practice with agreed strategic goals. It's commitment to the Treaty Waitangi, the inclusion of te reo and developing relationships with local iwi is supported by the church‘s acknowledgement of these aspects of tikanga and te reo Māori.</p><p>The kindergarten committee has parent representatives, and welcomes consultation with parents about strategic direction and kindergarten policies and procedures. The committee has open and transparent systems that ensure the Kindergarten finances are well managed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers have continued to develop their planning and assessment processes. ERO and centre leaders agree that the next step for teachers is to refine assessment and evaluation processes to make learning more visible, and use this learning information to plan for individual children's next steps.</p><p>To support their continuing growth and development, leaders and teachers could show how their professional discussions and development are aligned to their strategic plan.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ezekiel Trust Community Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ezekiel Trust Community Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>15 July 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
