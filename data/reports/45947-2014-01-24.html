</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Buddies Learning Centre in Mt Roskill, Auckland, first opened in July 2012. The centre provides all day and/or sessional education and care for up to 54 children, including up to 10 under the age of two. The centre aims to provide exemplary childcare for the children of Mt Roskill, in partnership with parents/whānau and the wider community.</p><p>Children are placed into three age groups. The indoor area features separate spaces for infants, toddlers and preschoolers. The three groups share one outdoor area, and opportunities are provided for children of all ages to play together in the mornings and late afternoon.</p><p>The principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, underpin the centre’s philosophy and practice. The centre acknowledges and supports New Zealand’s bicultural heritage. The service also embraces and celebrates other cultures in the increasingly multi-ethnic environment of Mt Roskill.</p><p>The largest ethnic groups in the centre are Indian, Pakistani, Afghani and Fijian-Indian. The inclusive nature of the centre is reflected in its provision for children with special and additional learning needs.</p><p>The centre is privately owned. The centre director is an experienced educator and has had a major role in designing, equipping and staffing this purpose-built facility. All teaching staff are registered teachers and some have had overseas teaching experience. Team leaders and the teachers are well supported by the centre director and specialist consultants to continue their professional learning and development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Multiculturalism is one of the outstanding features of the centre. Children’s cultural identities and languages are valued and respected. Children have opportunities to hear and learn the Māori language through greetings, songs and celebrations of New Zealand’s bicultural heritage. Their own languages and cultures are affirmed by their teachers and through the many cultural celebrations in the centre programme.</p><p>Effective communication and partnership with parents and families, another strength of the service, benefit children’s learning. Good quality assessment approaches enable staff to keep parents well informed about their children’s learning and progress. The centre is responsive to parents’ aspirations for their children and their desire to have their children settle well and succeed in education.</p><p>Children’s learning and wellbeing are central to centre operations. The calm, orderly learning environment created by the teachers helps children to feel secure, have a sense of belonging and become confident, competent learners.</p><p>Relationships within the centre are warm and respectful. Children enjoy playing and learning together. Teachers are caring and attentive. They support children and engage with them in learning activities. Teachers are especially responsive to children with special needs and have been effective in advancing their progress.</p><p>Infants receive nurturing and loving care. They are encouraged to develop self-management and social skills as well as their language, thinking and physical abilities. Learning programmes for the younger groups of children are thoroughly prepared and build on children’s interests. Children are keen to learn and happily participate in learning activities, extending their knowledge and skills.</p><p>The preschool programme remains an area for review and improvement. The programme is overly teacher directed and does not adequately promote opportunities for children to develop their independence and self-management skills. A review of the current structure is needed to provide a better balance between educationally recognised good teaching practices and managing parents’ aspirations. Children require more opportunities to develop complexity and challenges through sustained play. Reducing the number of transitions during the day and offering more flexible routines should help teachers to make this change.</p><p>The centre director sets high standards for all aspects of centre operations in order to provide a high quality service that promotes positive outcomes for all children. The thoughtfully designed and well equipped rooms and facilities are clean and attractive.</p><p>Policies, procedures and quality assurance monitoring systems are well developed. Self review for centre improvement is an established a part of centre culture. The centre director supports and mentors teachers effectively to continue developing their teaching practice and to fulfil their leadership roles.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre director and ERO agree that the next steps to guide centre development could be for teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>identify learning outcomes for individuals and groups of children in programme evaluation and planning</li>
<li>share good practices about ways of being more flexible and spontaneous in responding to children’s interests rather than allowing teacher-led group routines to dominate children’s learning.</li>
</ul><p>The centre director should also ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>centre self review includes more evaluative questions and agreed indicators of high quality early childhood education practices</li>
<li>management plans are extended into a strategic plan that includes self-review and quality assurance processes and outcomes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Buddies Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Buddies Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>24 January 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
