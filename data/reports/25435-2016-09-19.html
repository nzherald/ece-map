</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Nanaksar Education Phulwari operates under the AIEC Trust, the education wing of the Nanaksar Temple Trust in Manurewa. This trust is an Indian charitable organisation that operates in the Sikh Temple complex. The service provides full day education and care for up to 38 children from two to five years of age. The majority of children are of Indian heritage.</p><p>Children are grouped according to their age and stage of development but are also encouraged to move between rooms to learn alongside their peers and siblings. The centre philosophy aims to provide "an environment that is spiritually blissful and allows for the holistic development of each child". The centre's philosophy also makes a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and bicultural education.</p><p>The centre is managed and governed by members of the AIEC Trust, volunteers from the Sikh community and the owners of privately owned centres. Management believes that through work they have undertaken with families in the community there has been a positive shift towards valuing early childhood education.</p><p>ERO's 2013 review of the centre identified good practices and recommended improvements including building emergent leadership, improving appraisal processes, embedding self-review and strengthening the curriculum. The board has employed a centre manager who is supporting improvement in all of these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled, and engaged in the programme. The respectful and nurturing care that they receive from teachers encourages their sense of wellbeing and belonging. They are supported to manage their relationships with others and in self-help skills and independence. While the centre does not follow religious beliefs, there is a sense of well-defined values and spirituality. The centre philosophy is clearly evident in the programme.</p><p>Connections with children's families and the community are a strength of the centre. Management and teachers support families well. The centre is warm and welcoming and provides carefully presented parenting education. The centre's strong links with support agencies help ensure positive learning outcomes for children and families.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation practices are well established. Under the guidance of the new manager, teachers are writing meaningful learning stories that are linked to the goals and strands of<em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Planning for the programme is shared with staff and parents and recorded. Teachers could consider how to extend individual children's ideas as well as providing for group interests when planning to support children's learning.</p><p>Learning te reo and tikanga Māori is part of everyday practice in the centre. Teachers use te reo Māori in their conversations with children, and children sometimes incorporate Māori words spontaneously when talking with their peers. They sing waiata with enthusiasm and understand tikanga in the context of centre routines. There are no Māori children attending the centre at present.</p><p>Oral language is a strength in the centre. Children confidently use a number of languages during play. They talk with their friends and with teachers in English as well as their home languages. Levels of conversation are high. Children are supported by teachers to feel confident in their own culture and identity. The print-rich environment includes a number of languages recorded in different scripts.</p><p>Transitions into, through and out of the centre to school are well managed for children and families. Self review is regular, focused on the programme and is becoming more refined.</p><p>Strategic and annual planning processes are established. Plans are regularly updated to indicate progress in meeting goals for continuous improvement. Strategic appointments have strengthened the capability and sustainability of the service. There is a focus on continual learning for adults, team building together with mentoring and modelling of good practice. Appraisal processes are now more robust and teachers are encouraged to select professional development to strengthen their practice.</p><p>Management and governance of the centre is sound. A framework of policies and procedures guide operations. Effective systems are in place for regular review leading to sustainability of practice. The majority of the teachers are qualified and staffing is stable.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO discussed and management agreed that key next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increase child voice in portfolios, and more clearly record links between learning stories to show children's progress over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support teachers to encourage children's thinking through questioning in open-ended ways</p>
</li>
<li>further develop self review as a way of consistently improving teaching practice</li>
<li>continue to refine staff appraisal processes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nanaksar Education Phulwari completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Nanaksar Education Phulwari will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>19 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
