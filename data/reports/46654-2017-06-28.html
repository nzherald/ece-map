</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Secret Garden Gables Childcare Centre Ltd is a privately owned service in rural Palmerston North. The centre has operated for two years. This is the second centre in the Manawatu area, opened to accommodate the growing roll. It is licensed to provide education and care for up to 65 children, including 25 aged under two years. Most children attending come from nearby suburbs and surrounding rural districts. Currently there are 13 Māori children on the roll.</p><p>The centre owner who is educational leader, has overall responsibility for governance and management. She is supported by two team leaders who lead the teaching team in the two learning spaces.</p><p>A Reggio Emilia inspired approach to education is woven within the guiding principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Children and their whānau have the opportunity to experience and develop valuable skills, knowledge and confidence in a rural context.</p><p>This is the first report for The Secret Garden Gables Childcare.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service’s philosophy is highly evident in practice. It is underpinned by shared values and beliefs. Leaders and teachers enact the vision, mission and strategic direction of the centre.</p><p>Children are empowered to take increased responsibility and lead their learning. There are multiple opportunities for mathematical, literacy and scientific learning. Children are supported to develop as confident and competent communicators through ongoing learning conversations, open-ended questions and sustained interactions. Spacious areas, both indoors and outdoors, provide children with opportunities to explore environments that provoke discovery and imagination. There is a strong focus on environmental sustainability. </p><p>Teachers observe and respond to group interests linking them meaningfully to schemas, dispositional learning and <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Children's portfolios provide a well-presented record of their participation in a wide range of activities. They highlight children's emerging friendships and show strong positive respectful relationships between teacher and child. Staff know children and their families well.</p><p>Leaders acknowledge that the cycle of assessment, planning and evaluation requires strengthening. Assessment documentation should consistently and explicitly:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>show how teachers intentionally draw on evaluation and assessment to inform future strategies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>demonstrate active learning partnerships with family, as children's home culture and context directly impacts on their learning progress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>indicate how teachers' knowledge of children's interests, schemas and dispositions supports their progress over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children requiring support for diverse needs are fully included. External agencies are accessed when required to ensure all children can achieve success.</p><p>Teachers are very responsive to non-verbal cues of young children. Respectful practice is highly evident in all interactions. Infants and toddlers benefit from a calm nurturing environment. Positive, respectful and secure child and teacher relationships foster a strong sense of self and belonging for the child. The importance of play as a vehicle for learning is respected and valued.</p><p>Bicultural practice is evident. Aspects of te ao Māori, including te reo Māori, tikanga, artefacts, visual symbols and waiata, are valued and visible. Leaders have indicated their commitment to continually improving the bicultural programme. Developing and enacting targeted authentic learning partnerships would promote educational success for Māori children. This is a next step.</p><p>Transitions into and through the centre are very well considered. These processes are supported by effective relationships between families, the centre and school. Teachers nurture children’s friendships and engagement in the group to enhance their security and confidence during transition times.</p><p>There is a strong focus on continual improvement. Review is regularly undertaken. It is a collaborative process and includes parent and whānau voice. Review is appropriately focused on children and result in improvements. Currently, reviews are used as research and development projects. A next step is for leaders and teachers to further refine the focus on the purpose and use of self review/internal evaluation.</p><p>The recently-reviewed appraisal process is cyclical, builds on previous learning and is collaborative. It has strong alignment to the centre philosophy and other operational systems and structures. The process includes research and is clearly outlined for teachers. Staff are well supported to improve their performance. There are high levels of robust reflection and regular explicit feedback to support professional growth. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>refine internal evaluation processes to further support positive outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the cycle of assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop their understanding of purposeful strategies to promote educational success for Māori children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Secret Garden Gables Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Secret Garden Gables Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>28 June 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
