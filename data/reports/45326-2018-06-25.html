</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Active Explorers provides all-day education and care for infants and children up to school age. The centre is licensed for 80 children. Children of similar ages learn alongside one another in four classrooms (0-1 year olds, 1-2 year olds, 2 - 3.5 year olds and 3.5 - 5 year olds). Children also have access to two outdoor play areas which are adapted to younger and older children's development needs.</p><p>The centre's teaching and learning philosophy is currently under review. Previously it has focused on supporting children to become competent, confident learners. It aimed to achieve this through a focus on positive, respectful relationships, partnerships with parents and the provision of a nurturing and safe environment that provides children with challenge.</p><p>The centre is owned by the Evolve Education Group. It has recently been rebranded as an Active Explorers centre. It was previously known as Southern Kids. The centre is led by a centre manager and three head teachers who are supported by an Evolve area manager and a teaching and learning leader.</p><p>There have been a number of changes in leadership since the centre's 2015 ERO review. However these have mostly involved staff with long-term experience in the centre stepping into leadership roles. More than 80% of staff are qualified early childhood teachers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teaching practices and programmes are effective in promoting positive outcomes for children. Teachers build positive, responsive and respectful relationships with children. These effectively support children's sense of confidence, wellbeing and belonging in the learning environment. Teachers know children well as learners and individuals, and plan learning that responds well to children's interests and dispositions. They could better document next learning steps and the intentional strategies they plan to use to extend and promote important learning.</p><p>Transitions into and through the centre are carefully planned and managed to ensure children's wellbeing and confidence is maintained. Tailored programmes for older children are focused on supporting children to develop the independence, self-management and social skills to successfully transition to school.</p><p>Increasing use is being made of community resources to enhance children's learning opportunities and connections to their local community.</p><p>All children have regular opportunities to experience and learn about New Zealand's bicultural heritage. Te reo Māori and New Zealand sign language are integrated in learning programmes.</p><p>Infants' and toddlers' wellbeing and sense of security is well supported by calm, nurturing and responsive caregiving. These younger children have access to an outdoor environment that provides appropriate opportunities to develop their physical capabilities. Increasing use is being made of natural resources to encourage children to explore and experiment and build their understanding of how the world works.</p><p>Children with special and particular needs are very well supported to participate in learning alongside their peers. Leaders and teachers form effective partnerships with external specialists to identify learning needs and goals and to develop individualised plans for promoting children's learning and development.</p><p>Parent and whānau involvement in their children's care and education is highly valued and sought after. Teachers work closely with parents and whānau to:</p><ul>
<li>learn about children's interests, strengths and dispositions and their preferences and routines</li>
<li>gather parents' aspirations for children's learning</li>
<li>make links between children's home life and learning in the centre.</li>
</ul><p>The centre has improved systems for communicating with parents about their children's learning outcomes.</p><p>The new leadership team is working constructively together to promote effective teacher practice and support positive outcomes for children. They model respectful relationships with each other, families, children and teachers, and are building a collaborative, professional team culture. They are actively building their leadership capability. Key priorities for this team are:</p><ul>
<li>leading the review and implementation of the centre's new teaching and learning philosophy</li>
<li>ensuring teachers have shared understandings of effective practices for enacting the philosophy</li>
<li>leading deep and meaningful evaluation processes to know how well the philosophy is being implemented and how well children are achieving learning outcomes</li>
<li>supporting teachers to evaluate more deeply the effectiveness of their teaching practice.</li>
</ul><p>Children's and teachers' health and safety and the smooth operation of the centre are well supported by Evolve systems, procedures and management support functions. Regular quality assurance processes, including for the quality of care and education, are designed to give assurance that the centre is meeting requirements. Aspects of this assurance process could be more consistently followed. The governance/management group provides regular professional learning and networking opportunities to support the capability of leaders and teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To improve current practice, Evolve teaching and learning leaders and area managers need to:</p><ul>
<li>ensure quality assurance processes are well used to evaluate the quality of care and education and compliance with requirements, and to identify areas for improvement.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders know they need to:</p><ul>
<li>ensure the new teaching and learning philosophy clearly identifies desired learning outcomes for children and the associated teaching practices</li>
<li>ensure that centre strategic and annual plans are focused on the embedding of the new philosophy throughout centre practices and operations</li>
<li>plan and implement over time meaningful evaluation of the implementation of the philosophy and children's achievement of the learning outcomes.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers need to:</p><ul>
<li>be more explicit in assessment and planning documents about what teaching strategies they intend to use to promote and extend important learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Active Explorers Invercargill completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Active Explorers Invercargill will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>25 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
