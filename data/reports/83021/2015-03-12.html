</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Otago Childcare Centre provides a welcoming, homely environment for children and their families. As a community-based centre it enjoys close relationships, and support from the centre parents and its wider community.</p><p>The centre maintains a high ratio of qualified staff. There have been recent changes to the centre. These include a number of new teachers and parent committee members. Teachers and leaders have brought about many positive changes in addressing the recommendations of the last ERO review.</p><p>Teachers provide positive learning and care for the children, from under two to five years of age in full-day sessions. They aim to develop children’s confidence, competence and independence. They achieve this through a flexible, mixed-age programme. Children experience a wide variety of learning based on their interests, strengths and needs.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A feature of the centre is the warm and positive culture, evident in the way the staff, children and parents relate to each other. Children settle quickly on arrival. They show they are comfortable and familiar with the centre routines. High staffing numbers mean that children’s interests and strengths are noticed and supported. Teachers get to know the children and their families well. They closely monitor each child’s needs and ongoing development.</p><p>The centre offers flexible, well-managed programmes for all children. The children are provided a rich range of group learning experiences and opportunities. A highly engaging transition programme is in place for children over four years. It provides opportunities for cooperative learning and practical activities. Children of all ages benefit from a well integrated range of learning experiences. These experiences include a variety of art, dance and music, mathematics and science, and learning about other cultures. The development of oral language is a consistent focus for all teachers and especially for children under two years.</p><p>ERO observed examples of effective teaching that supported the aims of the centre philosophy. Children were:</p><ul>
<li>given space and time to be involved in and to lead their learning</li>
<li>invited to participate and contribute in purposeful activities for learning</li>
<li>engaged in prolonged and enjoyable interactions with their teachers</li>
<li>supported to play and learn alongside and with others</li>
<li>given feedback that acknowledged their effort and success.</li>
</ul><p>Since the last ERO review, teachers have significantly increased opportunities for children to learn aspects of te reo and tikanga Māori. They have recognised the need to continue to build on this and are supporting each other to use te reo Māori more often and more meaningfully in the daily programme.</p><p>The centre leaders reflect on what is happening and focus on continually making improvements. They have established some sound systems to support teacher development. They operate well as a leadership team and take a measured approach to the rate of development. They have developed a positive working culture with staff.</p><p>A stronger focus is being placed on building teaching practices. This is informed by the very useful review of teachers’ planning and helpful advice and guidance from an external provider. As a result, a number of improvements are being made to teaching practices and the way children’s learning is identified, supported and reported. The new teaching team is enthusiastic and collaborative about the developments that are being made.</p><p>The centre manager has established some effective systems for managing the centre’s operations. The strategic plan provides a sound basis for leading the centre development. It clearly describes how the centre philosophy and the strong priority for developing high-quality teaching and learning are to be achieved. A good process is followed to guide centre reviews. Some useful outcomes have resulted from recent programme reviews.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The parent committee and head teacher have identified that they need to continue to develop their capacity to govern and lead. ERO supports this view and suggests that their next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>use long-term planning better to monitor, report and review the centre priorities</li>
<li>align appraisal to the centre’s priorities for development</li>
<li>ensure the framework for self review is better aligned with centre plans and processes.</li>
</ul><p>The centre leaders have identified that teachers need to continue to develop how they plan for and extend children’s learning. This involves improving the focus for and visibility of the learning for individual children and the teaching strategies used to support this.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Otago Childcare Centre Inc completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.</p><p>In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO noted some aspects of health and safety that were not consistently followed. The centre manager and teachers should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>earthquake trial evacuations are regularly carried out</li>
<li>notification of accidents to parents and risk analysis forms for education outside the classroom excursions are appropriately signed.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Otago Childcare Centre Inc will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer-Southern</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>12 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
