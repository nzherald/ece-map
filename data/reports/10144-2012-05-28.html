<a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Whangarei Hospital Play &amp; Recreation Service operates from a playroom in the children’s ward. Play specialists provide resources at the bedside for children and visit other sites and clinics in the hospital. They also cater for patients and siblings up to 16 years old, providing educational programmes and therapeutic play to support children through medical procedures. The service operates within the policies and management systems of Whangarei Hospital.</p><p>Children are relaxed and show a sense of well-being in the playroom. They enjoy trusting relationships with play specialists and confidently explore the resources provided. Play specialists are responsive to children’s expressed interests and readily provide equipment to encourage children’s play.</p><p>Play specialists consult parents about strategies to support children and welcome their involvement in the playroom. They also model effective strategies for working with children for other health professionals and are developing roles in the multidisciplinary health teams. The next steps are for play specialists to enhance learning challenges in the playroom and to foster continuity with children’s learning in their regular early childhood centres.</p><p>The licensee and management committee strongly support the play specialists’ team. They are responsive to professional development requests and resource the service well. The licensee agrees with ERO that further development of strategic planning and self review processes should help the play specialists to achieve goals and strengthen their focus on learning outcomes for Māori children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Whangarei Hospital Play was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atWhangarei Hospital Play .</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO’s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The play specialists’ team has remained unchanged since the 2009 ERO review. However, a second reliever has recently been employed enabling the play specialists have greater flexibility in their work hours and professional development. The team is also supported by several volunteers who assist with tasks including the work with children.</p><p>In 2009 ERO identified several areas for improvement in the service to do with the quality of programmes for children. Most of these remain areas for continued improvement. despite play specialists’ endeavours to address them.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><em>Relationships.</em> The play specialists establish very good relationships with children and their families/whānau. They provide a welcoming environment in the playroom that enables child patients, their siblings and family to relax, play and explore resources. Play specialists are skilful in getting to know children quickly and in finding a good balance of empathy, humour and encouragement. This helps children to manage their hospital experiences successfully. Play specialists also work effectively with parents/whānau, listening to concerns, providing appropriate guidance and supporting them to access other agencies when needed.</p><p><em>Therapeutic play.</em> Children benefit significantly from the therapeutic play that prepares them for medical treatment. Play specialists skilfully introduce children to equipment and procedures. This helps to minimise children’s anxiety and allows them to have some sense of control over what happens to them. Play specialists also provide distraction for children during difficult procedures and while they are awaiting treatment. Therapeutic play builds children’s confidence, resilience and understanding.</p><p><em>Child advocacy.</em> The play specialists are strong advocates for children in the hospital. They also provide valuable role modelling for other staff by demonstrating respect for children, appropriate ways to engage them and ways to gain children’s cooperation during unfamiliar procedures. Other medical professionals benefit from the play specialists’ guidance in positive approaches, respectful interactions and belief in children’s competency.</p><p><em>Resources.</em> The service is well resourced with equipment and materials that cater for a wide range of children of different ages. While space and the constraints of hospital treatment often limit the scope of play, the play specialists have developed a good variety of resources that encourage children to enjoy creative and constructive experiences. The resources also support children to integrate early literacy, numeracy and technology learning in the context of their play.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p><em>Management.</em> Several management systems within the service should be strengthened. While play specialists are well supported by the hospital management systems and policy framework, the processes for Play &amp; Recreation are not always effective. Areas for further development include:</p><ul>
<li>establishing a process to guide the implementation of the strategic plan</li>
<li>setting up a formal cycle of self review of policies, systems and procedures to enhance the focus on early childhood education</li>
<li>accessing professional development for play specialists that is focused on early childhood education teaching and learning</li>
<li>revising the appraisal process, so that it incorporates the play specialists standards and ensures appraisal is undertaken annually.</li>
</ul><p>An important priority for the play specialists and managers is to review the Treaty of Waitangi policy and the Mission Statement for the service.</p><p><em>Programme planning.</em> The play specialists should more deliberately plan learning experiences for children who have longer hospital stays. They could make better use of children’s learning stories to show how adults have extended play and use the “Daily Happenings” book to evaluate the quality of learning they provide.</p><p>Play specialists could also liaise with children’s regular early childhood services to foster the continuity of their learning.</p><p><em>Teaching and learning.</em> Traditional early childhood teaching and learning is not easy for play specialists. Educational experiences are constantly interrupted by medical procedures, hospital routines or children’s health conditions. Some strategies play specialists could consider to maximise learning opportunities include:</p><ul>
<li>identifying ‘work in progress’ and encouraging children to return to these tasks</li>
<li>formally recording notes in children’s individual plans to foster continuity in learning</li>
<li>displaying more of children’s work and stories to encourage them to revisit learning</li>
<li>maintaining a particular focus on the success of Māori children.</li>
</ul><p>The challenge for play specialists is to remain focused on providing meaningful learning experiences that extend children’s thinking and add complexity to their play.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Whangarei Hospital Play completed an ERO Centre ManagementAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>During the course of the review ERO identified areas of non-compliance. In order to address these, centre managers must:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>ensure that staff performance appraisals are undertaken each year<em> [Statement of Desirable Objectives and Practices (1996) 11(a)].</em></p>
</li>
</ol><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendations</h2><p>ERO and the play specialists and managers agree that:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>play specialists should continue to develop strategies for managing the programme with a focus on planning experiences that will challenge children and provide continuity in their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>play specialists and managers should improve their self-review processes in order to address the areas for development identified in this report.</p>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-whangarei-hospital-play" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Whangarei Hospital Play</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office’s latest report on Whangarei Hospital Play .</p><p>Whangarei Hospital Play &amp; Recreation Service operates from a playroom in the children’s ward. Play specialists provide resources at the bedside for children and visit other sites and clinics in the hospital. They also cater for patients and siblings up to 16 years old, providing educational programmes and therapeutic play to support children through medical procedures. The service operates within the policies and management systems of Whangarei Hospital.</p><p>Children are relaxed and show a sense of well-being in the playroom. They enjoy trusting relationships with play specialists and confidently explore the resources provided. Play specialists are responsive to children’s expressed interests and readily provide equipment to encourage children’s play.</p><p>Play specialists consult parents about strategies to support children and welcome their involvement in the playroom. They also model effective strategies for working with children for other health professionals and are developing roles in the multidisciplinary health teams. The next steps are for play specialists to enhance learning challenges in the playroom and to foster continuity with children’s learning in their regular early childhood centres.</p><p>The licensee and management committee strongly support the play specialists’ team. They are responsive to professional development requests and resource the service well. The licensee agrees with ERO that further development of strategic planning and self review processes should help the play specialists to achieve goals and strengthen their focus on learning outcomes for Māori children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre’s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO’s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> – including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> – other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> – assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
