</table><p>Piccolo Park Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Piccolo Park Early Learning Centre in Mt Wellington is one of three Piccolo Park services. It is licensed for up to 70 children, including 12 up to two years of age. There are three separate age-related groups known as Whenua, Wai and Ngāhere, all with easy access to the refurbished outdoor environment. Each room has a team leader to support the teaching team.</p><p>The centre employs eight registered teachers, who are supported by other teaching staff, an administrator and a cook. The staff reflect the ethnic diversity of the community. The directors hold the business, financial and assistant manager roles.</p><p>The centre's philosophy promotes a stimulating, respectful environment that supports children to be curious, capable and confident. A responsive curriculum recognises parents' values and aspirations for their children.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report noted that children were supposed to be self-managing, problem solvers and that teachers supported children's language, culture and identity. These features continue to be evident. ERO's report recommended reviewing aspects of the programme, growing leadership and establishing a formal strategic plan. There have been positive developments in these and other areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy, and confident in the centre. They have trusting relationships with teachers and consistently engage in play that interests them. Young children and toddlers play enthusiastically in small groups as they explore the outdoors. They enjoy books and interact and have fun with their peers and teachers. They benefit from natural environments and equipment that reflect the value placed on "nature's gifts" and that support many creative and imaginative play experiences. Children's independence is fostered through opportunities to make choices and develop self-help skills.</p><p>Infants and toddlers enjoy nurturing care. Good adult-to-child ratios enable very young children to develop a sense of belonging in the centre. Programmes support children's developmental milestones. Teachers encourage children to explore independently, attempt physical challenges and develop relationships with others. Infants interact confidently with adults and make choices about their play. Toddlers frequently play with the older children as they develop mobility and social skills. This enables children to transition easily through the centre.</p><p>Teachers know children well. They respond to individual interests and are sensitive and responsive to children with additional learning needs. Adults' conversations with children encourage them to share their ideas and sustain their play for long periods. Teachers often integrate te reo Māori and foster the use of children's first languages. They support children to develop early literacy and numeracy skills in meaningful contexts.</p><p>Teachers in each room maintain extensive planning folders to document shared interests and highlights of children's play. They record individual learning in children's portfolios. These systems provide strong guidance for intentional teaching and continuity for children's individual learning. Leaders support teachers' ongoing evaluation of programmes.</p><p>Parents and whānau are an integral part of the centre and are encouraged to be active partners in children's learning. They are invited to participate in centre events and excursions, surveys and reviews, and to contribute to cultural celebrations. Inclusive systems and open communication enable families to share their photos, values, aspirations and information about home experiences. Parents respond positively to the digital programme that allows extended family members to receive and comment on children's learning stories and photos.</p><p>The centre is well managed. The manager and her leadership team are well supported by the centre director to operate the centre efficiently with a sound policy framework and effective health and safety systems. An extensive overarching strategic plan guides centre goals. It is timely for the leadership team to refine the strategic plan and to document progress and the achievement of their aspirations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers agree that the key next steps for leaders are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>lead the implementation of the centre's bicultural partnership and build teachers' understanding and confidence in using te reo Māori more in the programme and in documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that portfolios continue to reflect children's learning over time with suggestions about next steps in their learning, and links to whānau aspirations.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Piccolo Park Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>17 October 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
