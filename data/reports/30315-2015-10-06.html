</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bright Stars Educare is an all-day early childhood education and care centre located in the Hamilton suburb of Deanwell. It is licensed for 25 children, with a maximum of five children up to two years of age. At the time of this ERO review, 36 children were enrolled, of whom 22 were identified as Māori, and 13 as New Zealand European/Pākehā.</p><p>The centre views whakawhanaungatanga as a basic value of the service. It aims to build meaningful relationships with the wider community, hapū and iwi. There is an expectation that children will learn life skills and values, and gain confidence through child and teacher-initiated activities linked to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Māori language is used naturally in the programme and at mat times, where approximately half the spoken language is Māori.</p><p>The centre is privately owned, and is one of two services managed by the owner. It employs both three qualified teachers, two of whom are Māori, and one of Pacific heritage. The centre is led by an experienced head teacher, and functions predominately as a mixed age-group.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. Since the last ERO review, the outdoor area has been substantially improved to provide an attractive space that offers rich play opportunities. Leaders and teachers have also concentrated on increasing parent involvement by providing whānau gatherings and encouraging parents and families to spend time in the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience warm, positive relationships and interactions with teachers, and with other children. Tuakana-teina relationships are strong, and older children are encouraged to assist toddlers with self-care activities and to include them in their play. Children are growing as confident learners, who show initiative and engagement in learning.</p><p>The environment is well prepared to offer a range of interesting activities and children also enjoy exploring the world of nature. Sustained active play using balls and tricycles is highly evident, as is imaginative play using cars, construction equipment and dress-ups. Children have fun.</p><p>Teachers support children’s communication skills through many sustained conversations and interactions that encourage them to share and extend their ideas. Mātauranga Māori is integrated in the programme, particularly during well-managed mat times, which include waiata, songs, stories, and the extensive use of te reo and tikanga Māori. Māori children and their families display a strong sense of belonging. Children’s home languages are valued and affirmed.</p><p>The centre has undertaken a useful review of the environment that has prompted teachers to provide dedicated space for the needs of infants and young toddlers. Four-year-olds can also choose to spend uninterrupted time interacting and exploring activities that include a literacy focus. Books are read and shared, and children enjoy drawing and creating.</p><p>Teachers have developed a useful approach to support children's transition to school. Children are developing social skills and a sense of empathy and confidence while exploring early literacy and numeracy concepts.</p><p>Teachers write learning stories that notice, recognise and respond to children’s learning. Children enjoy sharing stories and photos in their portfolios, and these provide a record of their involvement in the programme. Portfolios are also used to report to parents. Teachers know children well, and share their professional knowledge and understandings during staff meetings.</p><p>The programme builds on children’s interests and ability to manage their own learning and takes account of parents’ aspirations. Teachers recognise children with diverse learning needs, especially in language, and work hard to strengthen their skills and understandings. They prepare the environment to allow children to follow their interests, use the internet to research information, and develop teacher-initiated events and activities. Trips in the local area use buses, and focuses on events such as Matariki and the Balloon Festival. These experiences enrich and extend children’s learning.</p><p>Centre leaders, together with the manager, have created and retained a team of teachers who bring varied skills, strengths, interests and personalities to the centre. Teachers readily accept opportunities to take up leadership responsibilities.</p><p>The centre has a low turnover of staff, and the team is committed to the philosophy and vision of the service, which they see as a home away from home. Teachers warmly welcome parents, and value their participation, opinions and aspirations for their children.</p><p>The service manager has undertaken professional development and has developed a strategic plan to provide direction for future development. With further refinement to the goals, the plan should provide more measurable objectives for implementing relevant actions, and evaluate progress against these objectives. Attention should also be given to strengthening teacher appraisal to take account of practising teacher criteria.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified, and leaders and teachers agree, that the next step for the centre is to strengthen planning and assessment. Consideration needs to be given to:</p><ul>
<li>including information from parent aspirations and next steps in learning stories to respond to children’s individual learning</li>
<li>making links between learning stories to show children’s ongoing development and progress.</li>
</ul><p>The owner should continue to strengthen delegation practices and communication with leaders to promote smoother processes of centre management and organisation.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bright Stars Educare Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the service provider must ensure that parents/caregivers have given prior written approval to their child’s participation and of the proposed ratio for special excursions, prior to the excursion taking place.</p><p><em>[Licensing criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Services 2008, HS 17]</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bright Stars Educare Limited will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>6 October 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
