</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Polykids provides education and care for children from birth to school age. It is located on the Otago Polytechnic campus and is operated by the Polytechnic. Children of Polytechnic students and staff are given priority of attendance.</p><p>The centre has had major renovations to enlarge the centre and includes separate areas for younger and older children. The centre is licensed for fifty four children, including twenty children under two.</p><p>ERO found that some areas noted in ERO's June 2011 supplementary report are still being developed. These include staff appraisal, strategic planning, self review and leadership development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have positive, caring relationships with their teachers. Parents and children are warmly welcomed on arrival, and parents feel comfortable to spend time in the centre with their children. Children play and learn in settled groups for sustained periods of time. They benefit from thoughtful conversations with their teachers.</p><p>Teachers know the children well and can judge when they need support and when to challenge them. They help children solve problems and develop friendships with each other. Children and teachers celebrate success together.</p><p>The teachers thoughtfully provide a range of learning experiences for children. They make effective use of the inside and outside spaces for children to explore and play. Routines are consistently and calmly implemented, giving children a sense of security in being able to predict what will happen next.</p><p>Teaching teams have shared understandings of what is important for children to learn at the centre. Children experience a range of activities that:</p><ul>
<li>focus on literacy and verbal communication</li>
<li>challenge them to extend themselves physically</li>
<li>include te reo Maori, waiata and tikanga Maori</li>
<li>allow them to express themselves creatively and imaginatively</li>
<li>support their understanding of early mathematics.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers use children's interests as a starting point for planning. The individual children's learning priorities are visible and clear. In the best examples, the stories in the profiles show children's learning developing over time.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from respectful and nurturing relationships with their teachers. Teachers listen and respond to infants' and toddlers' verbal and non-verbal communication. Routines are used as learning opportunities where teachers talk with children and help them to play an active part in their own care. Teachers communicate well with each other to ensure consistency of children's care. Teachers maintain a calm, unhurried pace where children can lead their own learning. They provide a range of equipment and resources to encourage children to explore the world and their own abilities.</p><p>The manager has a useful strategic plan to guide aspects of the centre's programme and operation. It has yet to be formally evaluated and reported on. The centre manager has developed a close working relationship with the Polytechnic managers and staff. Together they provide useful management support such as human resource advice and maintenance of the centre. There are regular property and financial reports. There needs to be more specific reporting relating to the effectiveness of the strategic plan and quality of education to the Polytechnic managers in their role as governors.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager and teachers recognise that they need to develop and improve systems and leadership to ensure that high quality practice is consistent across the centre. This involves:</p><ul>
<li>developing a shared understanding of effective self review, including the use of an evaluative question and indicators of best practice to measure against</li>
<li>making the appraisal system more robust, with clear identification of goals, plans to meet these and evidence from a variety of sources</li>
<li>regularly monitoring and reporting to governance the effectiveness and quality of centre long and short-term planning.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers should further develop the curriculum by:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing the centre philosophy, describing what this will look like for the whole centre and including parents and children in the process</li>
<li>ensuring that assessment, planning and evaluation for groups and individual children are consistently high quality across the centre</li>
<li>taking a planned approach to incorporating Maori perspectives throughout the centre</li>
<li>using a rigorous process of self review to improve children's experience as they move from the younger to the older children's area.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Polykids completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should strengthen aspects of their risk-management assessment for excursions.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Polykids will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>4 August 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
