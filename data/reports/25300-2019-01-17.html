</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Finlayson Park Childcare Centre in Manurewa is licensed to provide full-day education and care for 24 children, including up to nine under the age of two years. Most children attending the centre have Māori or Pacific heritage. Children are catered for in three age-related groups. Children under two years have a separate room and often spend time with the older age groups.</p><p>The centre is owned by the board of the adjacent primary school and managed by a group that includes the school principal, a school trustee, the centre manager and a parent representative. The centre has had two changes of centre manager since the 2015 ERO review. The current manager was appointed at the beginning of 2018.</p><p>The centre's recently reviewed philosophy focuses on teachers working in partnership with parents/whānau to provide a child-led learning environment. The philosophy is underpinned by manaakitanga, care and respect. Teachers place value on children learning responsibility and developing empathy. Their educational approach is influenced by the Forest School philosophy and the curriculum includes many excursions into the local community.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report acknowledged the support provided for children to develop a sense of themselves as successful learners. The report also noted positive partnerships with parents and effective professional learning to support teaching and learning. Key next steps for improvement related to bicultural practice and teacher appraisal. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from positive and supportive relationships with teachers and each other. Interactions with teachers promote the valued outcomes identified in the centre's philosophy. Children's social competencies are promoted, and they are encouraged to direct their own learning for much of the day.</p><p>Teachers support children to build on their interests and to engage in authentic learning opportunities including outings into the community. The tuakana/teina relationships between children from the school and the centre contribute to the rich curriculum and to a positive transition to school.</p><p>Teachers successfully support the wellbeing and sense of belonging of infants and toddlers. Children’s home routines are followed at the centre when appropriate. The small numbers of children in this group enables their teacher to know them and their families well.</p><p>The physical environment promotes learning effectively. Children have easy access to a wide range of appropriate resources. There are discrete spaces that allow children to engage in uninterrupted play of their choosing. The outdoor area is well organised and resourced. There are appropriate physical challenges including space for children to be physically active.</p><p>Te reo and tikanga Māori are evident in the programme and the environment. Visits to the school’s immersion class support children's learning in relation to te ao Māori. Parents are encouraged to discuss their aspirations with staff so that these can be considered in planning programmes for children.</p><p>Children's diverse cultural identities are well supported. Pacific cultures are included and celebrated, and aspects of their home languages are part of the curriculum.</p><p>Teachers regularly record information about children’s learning. These records are shared with parents through electronic portfolios. Parents are encouraged to contribute to the assessment of their children’s learning and the planning of the programme. The manager has supported staff to improve assessment processes by focusing more on children’s interests.</p><p>Internal evaluation is used successfully to review the centre’s operations and guide ongoing improvements. The manager works well with staff to determine what is working well and what changes to make. Together they have reviewed the impact of changes on children’s learning.</p><p>The manager’s collaborative approach has encouraged greater involvement of staff in decision making and resulted in more distributed leadership. There is improved support for teachers to develop their practice. They participate regularly in relevant professional learning and incorporate their new learning into their teaching approaches. The newly introduced appraisal system supports teachers to reflect on their practice. Recent professional learning topics have included children’s language development and transitions to school.</p><p>The centre operations are guided by a comprehensive policy framework and there is a regular cycle of policy reviews. Staff and parents are consulted as part of the review process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager has identified clear and appropriate steps for ongoing development, including:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to strengthen assessment records for individual children to show continuity in their learning</li>
<li>participating in further professional learning to support teachers' ongoing understanding of the revised <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum</li>
<li>continuing to deepen and improve the documentation of internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Finlayson Park Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Finlayson Park Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>17 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
