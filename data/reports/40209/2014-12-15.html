</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fairfield Educare Ltd is a privately owned early childhood centre located in Levin. The centre provides full day care. It is licensed for 40 children, including 15 up to two years of age. Toddlers and young children have access to all areas in the centre. Of the 42 children attending the centre, 14 identify as Māori.</p><p>The owner and head teacher are experienced in leadership. Most teachers are qualified and have worked together for some time.</p><p>The philosophy reflects a sustained commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. Since the December 2011 ERO report, the centre has worked on developing their self review and strengthening performance management systems.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy is clearly evident in practice. Children learn in a welcoming and positive environment. They know the routines and expectations. They are purposefully and actively engaged and experience stimulating learning experiences. The physical environment offers challenge and interest and invites children to explore and become involved in a wide variety of activities.</p><p>Teachers have positive, sensitive relationships with children. They foster language development through open questions and responsive interactions. Teachers recognise they should provide more leadership opportunities for children within the curriculum.</p><p>Infants and toddlers experience a calm and unhurried programme. They have opportunities to lead their own learning. Consistent caregiving enables teachers to respond sensitively to each child’s changing needs and preferences.</p><p>Teachers reflect on values, beliefs and the philosophy when making curriculum decisions. They know children well. Teaching and learning responds to children’s diverse strengths, needs and interests. Problem-solving, communication and exploration skills are well supported. Many opportunities are provided for literacy and mathematical experiences. Programmes are designed to support children to become confident, capable mathematical learners.</p><p>Parents and whānau are warmly welcomed. Leaders and teachers promote a shared understanding of centre goals by creating opportunities for parents and whānau to share their views and aspirations. Parents' wishes for their children's care and education are acknowledged, displayed and kept to the forefront in curriculum planning.</p><p>A high level of commitment to bicultural practice is evident. Teachers’ professional development includes te reo Māori. The centre environment reflects the value teachers are giving to te reo me ngā tikanga Māori. Policies and procedures acknowledge Te Tiriti o Waitangi and guide inclusive and effective practices. Teachers give consideration to the culture and language of each child and seek ways to maintain and build on children’s cultural identity.</p><p>High quality learning stories record teachers’ understanding and responses to children’s current interests. Portfolios regularly show their individual progress and learning in relation to the strands of <em>Te Whāriki</em>. They include a high level of parent feedback. Leaders recognise that they are at an early stage of reflecting children’s language, culture and identity in portfolios.</p><p>Leaders are clearly focused on continuous improvement in the quality of outcomes for children. Professional development provision is robust and builds teachers' capability. Current theories of learning, teaching and development are appropriately reflected in practice. Performance management is linked to centre goals and teachers’ personal development. Leaders and teachers reflect critically on their own practice. Teachers are encouraged to build on their interests and strengths. Good use is made of resources and research to support their development.</p><p>Centre practices are inclusive. Leaders and teachers work closely with parents and whānau to support children with specific educational needs.</p><p>Transitions to school are facilitated by effective partnerships between families, centre and school. Frequent visits between the school and centre contribute to the development of children's confidence and sense of belonging.</p><p>Self-review practices promote and sustain improvement. Self review is a collaborative process involving all staff, parents and whānau. It is ongoing and responsive to identified priorities and uses evidence for decision-making. Strategic planning identifies centre priorities. These are linked to positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre managers agree to that next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>provide more leadership opportunities for children within the programme</li>
<li>better reflect children’s language, culture and identity in portfolios.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fairfield Educare Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Fairfield Educare Ltd will be in four years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>15 December 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
