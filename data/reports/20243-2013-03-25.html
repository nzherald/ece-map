<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Mairangi Bay is becoming better placed to promote positive outcomes for children. Staff are increasingly using self review to further improve children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Mairangi Bay opened in February 2008. The centre operates out of a purpose-built building located in a semi-industrial area. They provide all day and sessional education and care for children ranging from three months to five years of age. Children learn within appropriately designed age-related rooms and have easy access to suitable outdoor areas.</p><p>Lollipops Educare management systems, administration procedures and curriculum support underpin centre operations. Three new team leaders have been appointed during 2012 and teaching staff have recently upgraded all the learning spaces.</p><p>The centre has recently been relicensed and now operates as one merged licence. The centre director reports that there has been no impact of this merger on centre procedures as they have maintained all previously established management systems.</p><p>This is the first ERO report on the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed by the centre director, leaders and teachers. Teachers acknowledge the importance of partnerships with children&rsquo;s families. The centre director has developed a variety of ways to share information about children&rsquo;s participation in the programme and progress with parents. The centre director, leaders and teachers have also identified that a useful next step would be to increase parent participation in planning for children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Children settle quickly into play. Teachers support them as they explore activities within the well resourced rooms. Access to natural and recycled resources has been increased to foster children&rsquo;s creative and imaginative play opportunities. There is a focus on developing the confidence and independence of babies and toddlers. Teachers affirm the developing language and mobility of these very young children. Teachers&rsquo; respectful relationships with children of all ages contribute to the family-like atmosphere in the centre.</p><p>Qualified teachers work effectively within teams and maintain a calm atmosphere. The centre programme is based on the principals of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, and includes both child-initiated and teacher directed activities. Teachers are responsive to children&rsquo;s play by identifying equipment and activities to support and extend their interests. Children&rsquo;s ongoing learning is documented in individual development plans (IDP) that identify individual and group learning objectives for children. These development plans are shared with parents.</p><p>The centre director acknowledges that self-review systems continue to be developed. Teacher professional development needs have been identified using these review systems and, as a result, teachers are to participate in training designed to help them further extend children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Further review tasks involving consultation with the community about the centre philosophy have been undertaken. These have resulted in changes to the philosophy to better reflect the aspirations and expectations of parents and staff. Teachers agree with ERO that they now need to establish a common understanding of the philosophy in action.</p><p>In order to build on the good practices identified above, the centre director and team leaders agree that they should now work with teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>promote children&rsquo;s knowledge and experience of the bi-cultural heritage of New Zealand</li>
<li>further build teachers&rsquo; capacity to increase challenge and complexity in children&rsquo;s play</li>
<li>develop indicators of good practice and use them to review the philosophy in action</li>
<li>evaluate the impact of learning outcomes for children against planned learning objectives</li>
<li>review the impact of policies and procedures on developing positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Mairangi Bay completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>25 March 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
