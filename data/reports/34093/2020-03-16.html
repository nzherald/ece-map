</table><p>Huntly Early Childhood Centre Inc. is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Huntly Early Childhood Centre Inc. is located in the Kimihia suburb of Huntly. The centre is licensed for 40 children and offers both full and part-day education and care to children from two years to school age. At the time of this ERO review 55 children were enrolled, including 14 who identify as Māori.</p><p>Huntly Early Childhood Centre is an independent, community-based, non-profit, incorporated society that is governed by a management committee of elected parents and whānau. The committee aims to ‘provide affordable, high-quality care and education, in an environment where children develop as confident and competent learners.’</p><p>The centre’s vision focuses on developing children to be ‘competent and confident learners and communicators, healthy in mind, body and spirit, secure in their sense of belonging and the knowledge that they make a valued contribution to society.’ The centre’s philosophy includes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing respectful and reciprocal relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>responding to children’s strengths, interests and aspirations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing stimulating learning environments that encourage choice, challenge and exploration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>honouring the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa and respecting cultural diversity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>valuing child and whānau contributions to the learning programme.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the last ERO review in 2015 a new supervisor and assistant supervisor have been appointed. Both leaders were experienced members of the centre’s teaching team. Most of the other teachers and educators are long serving and experienced in their roles. The centre has a positive ERO reporting history and has responded well to the areas identified in the previous report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A rich curriculum promotes high levels of children’s engagement in learning. Children are encouraged to be independent, follow their own interests, solve problems and take risks. Hands-on and authentic learning experiences promote children's curiosity through self-directed exploration. Assessment shows ongoing observations of children in high-quality learning activities and builds a picture of what they know, are interested in and can do.</p><p>Culture, language and identities of Māori and other children are valued, shared and celebrated through centre practices and special events. Learning is enriched through well-planned programmes, experiences, visitors to the centre and trips into the local and wider community. The curriculum is highly responsive to children’s needs, supports a sense of belonging and empowerment, while growing their confidence and capabilities.</p><p>Teachers use very effective strategies to enhance learning. They skilfully extend learning opportunities and provide appropriate challenges for children. A strategic focus on developing children’s social and emotional competence contributes to calm and settled environments for learning. Tuakana-teina relationships promote co-operation and opportunities for children to interact and learn from each other. Relationships between children and teachers are warm and affirming. An inclusive approach to supporting children with additional learning needs is evident through consultation with parents, individualised planning and liaison with external expertise. Positive transitions to school are enhanced through a well-planned programme for four-year old children. Effective integration of literacy, mathematics and oral language in meaningful contexts supports and scaffolds learning. Children benefit from extensive opportunities to have uninterrupted play in attractive, interactive and well-resourced environments.</p><p>Effective leadership enables a collaborative culture for learning. A shared approach to decision making, and continuous centre improvement is enhanced through high levels of respect and relational trust. Leaders are well focused on building teacher reflective practice and capability which promotes consistency and sustainability of high-quality teaching and learning. Effective communication contributes to parents being well informed about children’s progress and sustaining positive partnerships. Leaders actively promote the centre’s involvement in the wider Huntly community. High expectations and a commitment to improving teaching and learning contributes to positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Strong systems and processes guide all centre operations. A shared vision and philosophy are well embedded in centre programmes and practices. Regular policy review and health and safety management support maintaining a safe physical and emotional environment for children and adults. Internal evaluation is responsive to identified priorities, well-informed by parent, family, whānau views and opinions and highly focused on improving outcomes for learners. The management committee is well informed about all aspects of the centre, and able to prioritise decision making and resourcing to enable equitable opportunities for children to learn.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To build on the existing positive planning and assessment practices, leaders and teachers should consider ways to further:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen the identification of children’s learning outcomes and next steps that are well aligned to <em>Te Whāriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extend the reflection of language, culture and identity for Māori and other students in learning stories.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Huntly Early Childhood Centre Inc. completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Darcy Te Hau</p><p>Acting Director Review and Improvement Services (Central)</p><p><span>Central Region - Te Tai Pūtahi Nui</span></p><p>16 March 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
