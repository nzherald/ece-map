</table><p>Auckland Point Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for all children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Auckland Point Kindergarten is one of 19 kindergartens governed and managed by Nelson Tasman Kindergartens. All kindergartens share a common vision and values. Infants, toddlers and children to school age may attend Auckland Point Kindergarten for up to 7.75 hours a day. School holiday programmes operate at three kindergartens. Children enrolled at other kindergartens can also attend these programmes.</p><p>Auckland Point Kindergarten is located on the grounds of Auckland Point School. Infants and toddlers of parents who attend the young parents' school are educated and cared for in an adjacent building that is part of the kindergarten.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, the kindergarten has made significant progress to meet the recommendations in the ERO report. Teachers have reviewed the purpose of profile books and are continuing to build their programme evaluation and self-review processes.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four kindergarten reviews in Nelson Tasman Kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are highly focused on their learning. They have many opportunities to be creative and explore their interests and ideas. Children can choose to work independently or in groups. Older children support younger children with their learning. Children have respectful, positive relationships with each other and their teachers.</p><p>Teachers work effectively with children by providing an inclusive, welcoming environment. They have a strong focus on fostering children's learning and development and meeting the aspirations of their families. Teachers regularly include music, literacy and physical activity experiences in learning programmes.</p><p>Teachers value and respect each child's home culture. They build positive, responsive relationships with children and their parents. Teachers have a very strong commitment to including bicultural practices and te reo Māori into learning programmes and many aspects of the kindergarten's operations. Māori children and all children, have rich opportunities to hear te reo Māori and learn about Māori culture.</p><p>Teachers use a wide range of natural resources and equipment to create home-like environments. Learning areas are carefully presented in ways that foster children's cooperation, independence and exploration.</p><p>Infants and toddlers in the kindergarten experience calm, unhurried interactions with familiar adults. Teachers respond to children’s cues, interests and needs in caring ways. Children enjoy easy access to a good range of appropriate resources and equipment.</p><p>Transitions into and within the kindergarten are flexible and well planned. Teachers provide useful information for parents about transition to school. Older children have many opportunities to visit the school and participate in appropriate school activities. Kindergarten leaders continue to work on ways to deepen learning partnerships with the school.</p><p>Teachers work very well together. They have clear roles and responsibilities. Leaders make good use of teachers' strengths and interests and encourage them to be thoughtful, reflective about their practice and responsive to children's needs.</p><p>This kindergarten has attained the bronze level within the enviroschool's programme. Parents and whānau have become increasingly involved in the kindergarten because of the enviroschool's approaches.</p><p>Self review is well established and regularly used to make meaningful changes to the learning programme and teachers' practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers, teachers and ERO agree, that the key next steps for the kindergarten are to:</p><ul>
<li>refine assessment, planning and evaluation processes to strengthen consistency of teacher practices</li>
<li>further clarify self-review procedures and practices to improve efficiency.</li>
</ul><h3>Nelson Tasman Kindergartens</h3><p>Nelson Tasman Kindergartens has a very strong commitment to te ao Māori (the Māori world) and ensuring their Senior Education Advisors (SEAs) and teachers are competent and confident in te reo and tikanga Māori. A kaiārahi Māori successfully works with each kindergarten to increase teachers’ knowledge and understanding of te reo and tikanga Māori to ensure Māori children succeed as Māori.</p><p>Nelson Tasman Kindergartens provides significant support for diverse learners and their families. Teachers in kindergartens with diverse learners receive considerable extra training and funding to ensure the needs of these children are well met.</p><p>Self review is thorough, well understood and effectively used at association level and in most kindergartens.</p><p>The CEO and SEAs provide strong professional support to the board and teachers. They work collaboratively and effectively use their skills to support the kindergartens and early childhood education in the wider community.</p><p>The skills and knowledge of the CEO and the SEAs are regularly sought by other kindergarten associations and early childhood services. Nelson Tasman Kindergartens is innovative in its approaches and regularly seeks opportunities to be involved in the wider educational and local communities to promote high quality learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>Nelson Tasman Kindergartens has a well understood vision and strategic and annual planning systems. There are close links between the association strategic plan, the kindergarten plans, self review, appraisal and professional development. The teachers and families are well supported by association managers and leaders to achieve the objectives of the association strategic plan and to provide high quality learning outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Nelson Tasman Kindergartens leaders have identified and ERO agrees that the next key steps for the organisation include: </p><ul>
<li>embedding a number of recent Nelson Tasman Kindergartens initiatives. These include board operations, particularly the inclusion of Māori perspectives and concepts, staff appraisal and involvement in Communities of Learning</li>
<li>strengthening consistency of child assessment, programme planning and evaluation across the kindergartens</li>
<li>continuing to investigate the role of parent committees within the association structure</li>
<li>strengthening the induction programme for head teachers and teachers. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Auckland Point Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Auckland Point Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>7 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ERO’s website</span></a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
