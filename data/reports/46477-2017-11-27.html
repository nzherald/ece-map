</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tamariki Station Ltd is a new privately owned service located in Paeroa. It is licensed for a maximum of 40 children, including up to 10 under the age of two years. A significant majority of the roll identify as Māori. There are two age group areas inside, one for young children and the other for infants and toddlers. There is a shared outside play area where both age groups play together. This is the first ERO review of the centre.</p><p>The management structure comprises a centre owner/manager and a manager who has professional oversight of the centre. A head teacher leads the centre's curriculum practices. Since opening the service in 2014, leaders and teachers have been focused on developing a shared vision and values for providing high-quality education and care. They have continued to develop and refine centre practices and systems. Teachers have accessed professional development and put in place processes for monitoring and improving service operations.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is to provide a service that reflects the value of whanaungatanga (relationships), which promote a sense of belonging for children and their families. Management and teachers believe in providing an environment that fosters whakaute (respect) for culture in an atmosphere of manaakitanga (caring) and kotahitanga (togetherness).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre is well placed to sustain practices that promote positive outcomes for children. Children and their whānau are warmly welcomed into an inclusive, friendly environment. There are high levels of relational trust between leaders, teachers, children and their whānau. Trusting, respectful and responsive relationships effectively support children's wellbeing and learning. The centre's philosophy value of whanaungatanga is effectively embedded in practice and successfully fosters a sense of belonging for all.</p><p>Children confidently engage in meaningful and sustained learning. They enjoy learning through their play, interests and strengths. Literacy, mathematics, science, the arts, and other curriculum areas are naturally interwoven in children's self-selected activities. Children can actively investigate and explore high-quality equipment and resources that are readily accessible. Learning is further extended through outings within the community, visits to the local library and school. Teachers have developed highly-effective transition processes to sensitively support children's transition into the centre and between age-group areas. Children are becoming familiar with the school environment and their transition to school is well supported. They have many opportunities to revisit prior learning experiences, helping them to develop knowledge, skills and strengthen learning dispositions that support and promote life-long learning.</p><p>Teachers are highly responsive to the personalised care needs of infants and toddlers. They are attuned to their interests, temperaments and personalities. Small adult-to-child ratios ensure infants and toddlers receive quality one-to-one interactions with teachers who work in close partnership with their families. Teachers are skilled at supporting and developing oral language, social and communication skills and competencies.</p><p>Children are empowered to develop as capable, confident explorers and learners. Teachers in both age-group rooms are skilled at observing children and use intentional teaching strategies to extend their thinking. Learning conversations provoke children's curiosity and encourage them to problem solve and helps them make sense of the natural, social and physical world. Tuakana tenia relationships, where children share their knowledge and support others' learning is encouraged by teachers. Children have many opportunities to think critically, use their imagination and be creative.</p><p>Children's language, culture and identity is valued and celebrated. Teachers actively seek ways to maintain children’s connections to their cultural identity. Children are proud to share their culture. Partnerships with whānau lead to reciprocal information sharing around culture, interests and home experiences. Te reo and tikanga Māori is a normal part of the daily programme. All children benefit from these experiences and Māori children are well supported to experience success as Māori.</p><p>Individual assessment portfolios provide a rich record of children's learning and progress overtime. Teachers have also developed a useful assessment summary for children and their families to share with new entrant teachers to help support children's learning pathways during their transition to school. Children, teachers, parents and extended whānau are involved in setting learning goals and can contribute to assessment on-line. Teachers skilfully include children's whakapapa and unique attributes they bring to their learning. Children's holistic development is well supported through these practices.</p><p>The centre has effective systems for evaluating learning and teaching. These well established processes and practices result in continual improvement to the quality of education that promote positive outcomes for children. Teachers are currently inquiring into the revised <em>Te Whāriki</em>, early childhood curriculum 2017, and further implementing the document in centre practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre now needs to strengthen internal evaluation by developing long term strategic goals that align with planned reviews. This should enable leaders and teachers to evaluate how well they are achieving the centre vision, goals and philosophy and make decisions about ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tamariki Station Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tamariki Station Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>27 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
