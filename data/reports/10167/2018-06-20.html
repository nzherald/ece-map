</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>East Tamaki Childcare Centre provides full-day education and care for up to 40 children, including up to 12 children under two years of age. The centre operates from a spacious, purpose-built facility. Children are provided with daily nutritious meals and snacks. Children under two years of age have their own indoor space with ready access to the shared outdoor area. There are good opportunities for children of different ages to play with each other throughout the day.</p><p>The centre philosophy promotes meaningful learning experiences and provocations for children in a welcoming and friendly environment. Children taking ownership of their own learning is emphasised and each child's uniqueness, culture and specific learning needs are valued.</p><p>ERO's 2015 report recommended that centre managers strengthen approaches to growing teacher professional practice, and further develop centre leadership and internal evaluation. Good progress has been made in these areas. The areas of non-compliance in relation to health and safety and governance practices have been addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy caring, respectful relationships with adults and each other. They are well supported to grow their social competencies. Teachers provide nurturing care for infants and build trusting relationships with them. Adults and children work and play well together.</p><p>Children have a wide variety of good learning opportunities in all areas of play and enjoy ready access to resources. Teachers design attractive learning areas to promote children's curiosity. Children engage in sustained periods of play and are able to move their play easily between the indoor and outdoor environments. Good opportunities for children to learn through the visual and performing arts are a feature of the centre curriculum.</p><p>Children are learning early literacy and mathematical skills through the weaving together of meaningful contexts and play. This integrative approach is promoted by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers effectively and respectfully support children with additional learning needs to participate in the programme.</p><p>Teachers help children to make independent decisions and to plan their play. Children have the opportunity to lead their own learning. There are some good examples of teacher interactions with children that extend children's play and support their language development. The consistency of these good practices across the teaching team is being increased through relevant professional learning and development opportunities.</p><p>Teachers plan and assess children's learning well. This enables them to provide a programme that is very responsive to children's strengths and interests. Parent feedback and contribution is acknowledged and documented. These approaches are helping teachers provide a curriculum that is relevant for children and their families.</p><p>Centre leaders are currently reviewing centre practices to strengthen provision for two-year-olds within the mixed-age environment. They could consider identifying someone to have leadership oversight of this, including the purchase of additional resources and the development of specific planning and evaluation for two-year-olds. This would help the centre respond better to two-year-olds as their identity as autonomous learners develops.</p><p>Diversity is valued and celebrated in the centre. Children's different cultural heritages and languages are reflected in the environment and the learning programme. Their first languages are valued and often used to support their learning. New Zealand's bicultural heritage is prominent, and te reo and tikanga Māori are integrated thoughtfully into the programme and environment.</p><p>The centre owner/manager effectively provides professional leadership for staff. She identifies staff strengths and provides opportunities for each person to contribute to improvements in curriculum and management practices. This is helping to grow a wider leadership team. Since ERO's 2015 review, the centre has participated in extensive and appropriate professional learning and development. This has resulted in positive impacts on outcomes for children. The centre is continuing to work with an external provider to develop robust and meaningful appraisal practices.</p><p>Internal evaluation is used well to promote ongoing improvements in the centre. Staff, parents, and children's perspectives are reflected in reviews and a shared ownership of outcomes is evident.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps to build on the good practices in the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>prioritise two-year-old children's learning in programme planning, assessment and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop consistency of good teacher practice across the centre by implementing a robust, meaningful appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue building the leadership capacity of all staff to contribute to centre improvements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of East Tamaki Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice the service provider should develop a crisis management plan.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of East Tamaki Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>20 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
