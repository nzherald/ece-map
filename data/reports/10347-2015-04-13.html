</table><p>Kelston Early Childhood Centre requires support to improve the quality of the curriculum and the management of the centre in order to better promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kelston Early Childhood Centre is an attractive, purpose-built centre which was established by the Kelston Community Trust in 2003. The centre is licensed for 40 children between two and five years of age. Half of the children enrolled have Pacific heritage, 20 percent are Māori and 20 percent are from other migrant backgrounds. A team of qualified, registered teachers is representative of the culturally diverse community. Some families have long term connections with the centre.</p><p>The Kelston Community Trust governs the centre and is involved in decisions about property and financial matters. A centre manager has responsibility for daily management of the centre. The building has recently been extended and the outdoor area remodelled. These improvements have been a major focus for the centre over the past three years.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy reflects <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and Te Tiriti o Waitangi. It promotes a welcoming environment where staff and families work together with respect and open communication.</p><p>ERO’s 2012 report recommended that teachers should continue to develop shared understandings about teaching and curriculum processes and self review. Teachers have participated in professional learning and development, but further improvement is required in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a sense of wellbeing and belonging. They readily access resources and make choices about their play. Children have opportunities to participate in uninterrupted sustained learning. They form positive relationships with other children.</p><p>Teachers interact respectfully with children. They know about children’s interests and home experiences, and use this information to promote their learning. Teachers are responsive to children’s ideas. They use good questioning to encourage children to share their thinking. Some teachers speak with migrant children and families in their home languages. Teachers promote positive transitions to school by encouraging children to be self-managing, independent learners.</p><p>The extended indoor area is attractive and very well resourced. The diverse cultures of the children and their families are valued and reflected in the environment. The renovated outdoor area provides natural spaces for children to explore and investigate.</p><p>Teachers require professional development and support to help them implement an effective curriculum cycle. They write about children’s play and learning in individual portfolios. Teachers should now increase the frequency of assessment records and make connections between stories to show children’s learning over time. They should also document how they plan for, and evaluate children’s learning programmes.</p><p>The manager and staff also require support to establish self-review systems to guide centre improvement. Linking self review to the well-considered long-term plan could enable teachers to evaluate the impact of centre goals on children’s learning. Manager and staff appraisals should be re-established as a priority.</p><p>The manager is an inclusive leader and she values a collective approach to teaching. She should now urgently lead improvements in curriculum and management practices. The Kelston Community Trust should develop systems to monitor how well legal requirements are being met.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager agrees that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>improving the quality of planning, assessment and evaluation of children’s learning</li>
<li>implementing self-review systems to guide improvement</li>
<li>establishing a cycle of manager and staff appraisal.</li>
</ul><p>Seeking professional advice will be essential to help teachers, the manager and the Trust to address these next steps.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kelston Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum and management. To meet requirements the service must:</p><ul>
<li>ensure that the curriculum is informed by documented planning, assessment and evaluation of children’s learning</li>
<li>implement an ongoing process of self review to help maintain and improve the quality of education and care</li>
<li>establish a system of regular manager and staff appraisal.</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C2, GMA6, GMA7.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kelston Early Childhood Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>13 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
