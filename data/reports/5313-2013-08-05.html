</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Carterton Kindergarten is located in Carterton, Wairarapa and caters for children aged from two to five years. It is an all-day centre and is licensed for 40 children. At the time of this review there were 49 children on the roll, including 19 identifying as M&#257;ori.</p><p>The Rimutaka Kindergarten Association effectively governs the kindergarten, and provides senior teacher support for the kindergarten. It is committed to maintaining the ratio of 100% qualified teachers. Clear policy guidelines outline association expectations for developing the programme and managing day-to-day operation.</p><p>The teaching team comprises a head teacher and four fully qualified teachers. The vision, emphasising the importance of providing an innovative learning environment, is clearly espoused. Teachers have responded effectively to the recommendation made in ERO&rsquo;s 2010 report. The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eleven reviews in the Rimutaka Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy of fostering confident and competent lifelong learners is highly evident in teaching practice.</p><p>Children successfully learn in a well-resourced environment where teachers:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>value children learning through sustained child-centred play alone and with other children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>emphasise the uniqueness of each child and their wh&#257;nau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>place importance on developing strong relationships with parents and wh&#257;nau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maintain highly respectful and inclusive relationships with children to support them to confidently participate in activities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>As a result, there is a busy and purposeful atmosphere that is conducive to learning. Relationships with children are warm, welcoming and responsive to needs. Tuakana teina interactions among children are promoted by teachers to support learning.</p><p>Teachers appropriately plan for groups and individuals. Planning is a reflection of what the child has been doing and how interests may be extended.</p><p>The head teacher works collaboratively with her team and effectively leads robust self review and evaluation. A shared leadership model is fostered. Teachers take responsibility for aspects of kindergarten operation. Children are given opportunities to manage their learning, including leading mat time.</p><p>Senior teachers provide well targeted, ongoing support and guidance for teachers. They promote regular professional development opportunities and useful systems that are focused on positive outcomes for children. A planned development of the performance appraisal processes has the potential to better promote teacher development.</p><p>There is a well-considered approach to support children and their parents with transitions to school. Literacy and mathematical experiences are effectively integrated throughout the programme. The curriculum is further extended through visitors to the kindergarten and excursions into the local community. Information and communication technologies (ICT) are enthusiastically used by children and are valued by teachers as learning tools. A current focus is on using ICT to encourage children to revisit their learning.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported. Teachers articulate a belief in inclusive education and where appropriate, liaise with external agencies. Routines are consistently implemented throughout the day, giving children a sense of security in being able to predict what will happen next.</p><p>Biculturalism is valued. Some te reo M&#257;ori is integrated into the programme. Teachers are gaining confidence in reflecting the language, culture and identity of M&#257;ori learners and recording this more effectively in children&rsquo;s learning stories. An appropriate association-wide review is currently being undertaken to evaluate and implement practices to enhance learning opportunities for M&#257;ori learners.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s emotional and physical wellbeing are promoted through sound health and safety practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s useful review processes have identified appropriate next steps. These are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>to continue building the evaluative capacity of teachers to systematically enquire into and judge the effectiveness of their teaching practice, including an ongoing review of the effectiveness of mat time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to ensure teachers&rsquo; key value statements are clearly reflected in assessment and planning practices and documented in children&rsquo;s learning stories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to further develop teaching strategies to provide opportunities for Pacific children to enjoy success as Pacific.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO's evaluation findings support the kindergarten&rsquo;s future direction.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Carterton Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Carterton Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>5 August 2013</p><p><img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt=""></p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/ERO-s-Approach-to-Reviews-in-Early-Childhood-Services-DRAFT-2012"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
