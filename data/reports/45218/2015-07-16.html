</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>A Step Ahead Early Learning Centre in Blockhouse Bay is a family-owned service that provides sessional and full day education and care for children from the surrounding suburbs. Children over two years of age are able to attend the centre, which is licensed for twenty children. Children and their families represent a number of cultural groups. Teachers share some of the same cultures and are able to speak in children&rsquo;s home languages.</p><p>The teachers&rsquo; philosophy for the centre includes commitment to reflecting <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and a focus on biculturalism in the programmes for children.</p><p>This is the second review of the centre. The 2012 ERO report commented favourably on the caring and respectful relationships teachers had with children. Calm interactions and a well planned play environment contributed to children&rsquo;s easy settling into the centre and their comfort and confidence.</p><p>ERO identified that teachers were becoming more confident with assessment and planning systems. The report suggested that a deeper self review focus should provide teachers with information about the impact of programmes on children&rsquo;s learning. The report also prompted teachers to provide more opportunities for children to extend their play in uninterrupted ways, and to include a stronger focus on biculturalism.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play together harmoniously. They benefit from the assured, collaborative teamwork of the teachers. The carefully prepared and attractive environment is well-resourced with good quality natural furnishings and resources. This encourages children&rsquo;s engagement and provides prompts for them to develop their play. Teachers&rsquo; friendly and sensitive interactions with children support them to settle quickly and become involved in play.</p><p>Parents who spoke to ERO appreciate the welcoming partnerships teachers have established with them. Teachers&rsquo; inclusive and warm interactions with children were also identified as strengths. Parents feel well informed about their children&rsquo;s progress and enjoy the portfolios that describe the learning programme. Teachers could now consider how they might more clearly record children&rsquo;s individual progress over time. They could also link assessment and programme planning in a more transparent way.</p><p>Teachers work closely with children, listening to them and encouraging conversations with them. They use their knowledge of individual children&rsquo;s interests and dispositions to guide programme planning. It would be appropriate for the supervisor to continue to provide leadership and modelling to further strengthen the growing professionalism in the teaching team.</p><p>Teachers&rsquo; self review follows an established pattern. The streamlining of this aspect of good practice is as a result of learning gained through professional development. Self review is now more clearly focused on exploring and making decisions about the learning programme. Teachers should continue with these good practices in order to guide the development of their teaching. Review should then help their understanding about the effects of their work on children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Teachers have identified a need to further develop bicultural practices in their work with children. They already support each other to use words and phrases in te reo M&#257;ori in the programme. It would be useful for teachers to continue to build their understanding of te ao M&#257;ori as part of their professional growth. Teachers could also reflect a more obvious focus on other cultural groups in the environment. Children are beginning to understand some words in the home languages of their friends in the centre.</p><p>Management of the centre is well ordered and efficient. A framework of effective policies and procedures is in place and these are reviewed regularly. The managers could now consider ways of aligning their strategic and annual planning as a guide for the streamlining of operational management.</p><p>The owners and the supervisor are committed to establishing a shared vision of high quality early childhood education and care. The centre philosophy is clearly evident in centre practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified and centre managers agree that their next steps are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen bicultural practices and understanding for teachers, children and families</li>
<li>use self review to strengthen and deepen consideration of the effectiveness of systems and practices within the centre</li>
<li>focus on increasing opportunities to engage children in conversation as a way of strengthening their understanding and use of language.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of A Step Ahead Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of A Step Ahead Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dianne Moffitt</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>16 July 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category.
