</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Children's Ward Playroom is a licensed early childhood service for children in Southland Hospital, Invercargill. Its overall aim is to help children and their families feel more comfortable in the hospital setting. The playroom itself is open to children and parents 24 hours a day.</p><p>One experienced long-serving Hospital Play Specialist (HPS) staffs the service. She is a registered HPS and qualified early childhood teacher. She works with children and their families on the wards and in the playroom. She works closely with the health professionals within the hospital. The HPS service is part of the Women's and Children's Health service of Southland Hospital, Southern District Health Board (SDHB). The HPS coordinates a team of volunteers who help her in the playroom.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report identified many positive features about the service. These are still evident. Internal evaluation remains an area for further development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Playroom offers a safe and welcoming place for children and their families to play and spend time together. Families can access the room at any time of the day or night. Children can also play and explore in the outdoor play area. The HPS creates a normal and enjoyable play environment by providing a wide range of familiar toys and activities for children of different ages. The HPS makes connections with children's home life, interests, and other early childhood settings. Wall displays and resources reflect children's varied cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The HPS gives careful thought to how she can reduce the stress and strangeness of children's hospital experience. For example, she gets children to handle the medical equipment they will meet and express their feelings through play. Children and their families benefit from the way the HPS responds quickly to events and circumstances as they arise. Each day the HPS prioritises the children most in need of her services. She ensures children do not undergo medical procedures in the Playroom.</p><p>The programme is based on Te Whāriki, the early childhood curriculum, with an emphasis on supporting children to be comfortable in the hospital setting. The service's philosophy statement would be more useful if it outlined in more detail the desired outcomes for children within this very specialised service. It could then provide better guidance for the HPS in her interactions with children and how she documents the difference she has made for children's learning and wellbeing. It would also help her evaluate how well programmes and practices are meeting the desired outcomes for children.</p><p>Records of learning for children who are long-term patients are appreciated by their families. The HPS fosters the children's sense of belonging and wellbeing by documenting their strengths, connections to their families, their cultural backgrounds and the interest they have in the activities of the Playroom.</p><p>The HPS acknowledges that much of her planning, assessment and evaluation occurs daily in the form of conversations between herself, parents and medical staff. The HPS and her manager agree that a next step is for the HPS to better record her decisions in children's clinical records, and how she has contributed to improving children's hospital experiences.</p><p>The HPS works well within the child-health team. The HPS advocates for the wellbeing of children and has been instrumental in improving hospital practice for the benefit of children. For example, children are now able to wear their own pyjamas to and in the hospital which has removed a major source of stress for them.</p><p>The HPS has taken the initiative to strengthen links with the HPS service in Dunedin, and attends the biennial HPS Association conference. These links are essential as she is the sole play specialist at Southland Hospital. She should now explore ways to strengthen these professional relationships to support her in her work.</p><p>The SDHB has a useful appraisal model. The HPS in Southland and Dunedin are adapting it for their services. The model would be improved by including written feedback after observations and by linking the HPS competencies to the Education Council requirements for teachers and including Tātaiako, cultural competencies for teachers.</p><p>The HPS reflects on her practice and looks to improve the way she works with children. She now needs to improve her understanding and practice of internal evaluation. Internal evaluation should be widened to include all aspects of the service and progress towards its vision and goals. The SDHB has systems in place for internal evaluation and improvement. The HPS and managers could explore how SDHB internal evaluation could be used in the HPS service.</p><p>The HPS service is well regarded by the hospital managers. Managers receive monthly reports aligned with the annual goals of the service. They could now develop a longer-term strategic plan to guide the future direction of the HPS service.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service manager, HPS and ERO agree that key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop a strategic plan that supports the service's goals and philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen professional networks for the benefit of the HPS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and use robust internal evaluation practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve written documentation of planning, assessment, and evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To improve current practice, the service managers and HPS should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>keep records of daily safety checks of the Playroom and outdoor area</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a written procedure for excursions.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Children's Ward Playroom - Southland Hospital completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Children's Ward Playroom - Southland Hospital will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>20 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service responds to children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the methodology for ERO reviews in Hospital-based Education and Care Services.</p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to contribute to children’s learning and promote their wellbeing. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"><span>ERO’s website</span>.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that contribute to children’s learning and wellbeing and are useful to the service.</p>
