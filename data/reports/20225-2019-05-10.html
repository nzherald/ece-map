</table><p>Caterpillars to Butterflies Childcare is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Caterpillars to Butterflies Childcare provides full-day education and care for up to 35 children, including a maximum of 15 up to two years of age. Children are grouped according to age for routine times, but are able to mix freely for the majority of the day.</p><p>Families and the staff team reflect the centre's diverse community. Four staff are qualified teachers and two, including the owner, are completing training in early childhood teaching qualifications.</p><p>This is the first review of this centre since a change of ownership. The owner works full-time in the centre and manages the daily operation and administration. She has appointed a qualified teacher to lead the development of a local curriculum.</p><p>The new owner has revised the philosophy to include reference to Te Tiriti o Waitangi as a guiding document. The centre's mission statement and philosophy have been developed in collaboration with staff. A new strategic plan sets aspirations and goals to guide centre operations, as teachers embed new philosophical ideas about teaching and learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle quickly to play at the start of the day. They are warmly welcomed by teachers, and make choices from the carefully and attractively arranged environment. Children engage in uninterrupted play for long periods. Teachers have close relationships with children and their families. These relationships support children's sense of belonging and wellbeing.</p><p>Revitalised indoor and outdoor environments have created spacious areas for children to develop their play. Ease of access to resources has added to children's ability to manage their own play. They engage in prolonged, friendly conversations and shared games. More frequent teacher conversations with children would help to support more complex play.</p><p>Infants and toddlers receive nurturing care, and have good opportunities to explore all parts of the centre. The playground is shared, and provides opportunities for children to challenge their physical skills and agility. Younger children are able to successfully master safe challenges. There are good processes in place for transitions into, through, and out of the centre.</p><p>Families are confident to approach teachers. They contribute information about their children's likes and interests to help teachers to make decisions about the learning programme. New assessment and planning systems have been developed, following whole team professional development. Teachers have made significant progress in observing and recording children's interests.</p><p>Teachers are working to increase their use of te reo Māori with all children. Some Māori protocols are included in routines. It would be useful for teachers to consider ways of recognising and celebrating children's cultural heritage and language in their portfolios, in consultation with whānau. This would be particularly appropriate to inform Māori and Pacific whānau and tamariki that their cultures and languages are respected and valued.</p><p>Collaborative review of policies and procedures has become regular. The owner is exploring ways of sharing policy decision-making with parents and whānau. Teachers are using a more thorough approach when considering the programme in action. Deepening these processes and providing leadership opportunities for teachers, children and families, would enable more informed decisions about the quality of the curriculum, and outcomes for children.</p><p>The owner places an emphasis on developing and sustaining a positive centre culture. She has made it a priority to engage all staff in professional learning, in order to develop shared understandings and agreement about curriculum practices. This has had a positive impact on teachers' confidence and enjoyment of their work with children, and is building improvement across the team.</p><p>Administration and documentation are becoming efficient. The strategic plan includes clear, purposeful statements about directions for the centre's development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner recognises that key next steps are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>use external support to build teacher capability and understanding of curriculum effectiveness, and to strengthen internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build culturally responsive practices that recognise and celebrate language, culture and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide leadership opportunities for children, teachers and families</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>revise the teacher appraisal process to meet Teaching Council requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Caterpillars to Butterflies Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>10 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
