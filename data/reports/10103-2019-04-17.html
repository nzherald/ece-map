</table><p><span>Amanda's Homebased ECE 2 is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</span></p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Amanda's Homebased ECE is a long-established provider of early childhood care and education in home settings. The service's philosophy expresses a commitment to quality homebased early childhood education (ECE) underpinned by a culture of professionalism.</p><p>This is a Quality Funded network. It is jointly managed as one of two Amanda's networks currently operating in Auckland. It provides care and education for up to 60 children, including children under the age of two years, in the educators' homes. All educators in this network have a minimum of a Level 3 early childhood education qualification. They work under the guidance and supervision of qualified Education Team Leaders (ETLs). At the time of this review. 33 children are enrolled and eight active educators.</p><p>Since the 2015 ERO report, two new ETLs have been appointed to the team. There has also been a reduction in the number of children they can be responsible for supervising. Amanda's maintains better than minimum ratio requirements in this regard. All ETLs are registered early childhood teachers. The 2015 ERO report noted that the owner and ETLs work as a team and are committed to ongoing improvement. These strengths remain evident. The report also identified next steps for the service. These included better systems for supporting ETL practice, establishing strategic self-review, updating long-term planning, and strengthening the bicultural curriculum. While good progress has been made, continued work in these areas would further benefit the organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service has high regard for the health, safety and wellbeing of children in its care. ETLs and educators know children well and monitor their ongoing development and learning. They ensure that children have access to a range of activities in homes, as well as opportunities to socialise with others at regular playgroups.</p><p>Programmes for children are underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and promote a bicultural approach. ETLs acknowledge that building their own familiarity with the 2017 refresh of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> and strengthening their expertise in te reo and tikanga Māori, would assist them in supporting educators' practices.</p><p>ETLs emphasise the importance of children learning through play. They support educators to enrich children's exploration through their discussions and monthly observations of each child. They also provide additional resources to extend children's learning. Termly planning meetings are held at playgroups. At these meetings, educators share their understanding of children's interests and agree on a shared topic. They also discuss ideas for related community excursions and activities that they can provide in their homes.</p><p>Children aged over three years are able to participate in the Magic Caterpillar programme. This programme promotes early literacy and numeracy as children begin preparing for transition to school. Developmental milestones of younger children are recognised and celebrated.</p><p>Maintaining good relationships with children, parents and educators is a priority for the service. A focus on strengthening communication with educators and families has been reinforced through the use of an online portal. Parents and whānau can see the educators' learning stories and ETL monthly reports for their children, and can add their comments and stories. This portal also allows the organisation to keep families well informed about news and upcoming events.</p><p>A culture of collaboration and open discussion is a strength of the management team. Leadership is promoted throughout the organisation. Strategic planning provides a useful framework for guiding decisions and improving systems and processes. Leaders could build on these positive foundations to strengthen support for the different approaches, strengths and development areas of the two networks. This would also help the organisation to evaluate the extent to which each service delivers on the service's overarching vision.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service owner and ETLs agree that the next steps for improving their service include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>reviewing the philosophy in order to strengthen the guidance it provides for planning for the network, and for the ETLs and educators to work towards achieving the organisation's vision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop internal evaluation to promote greater depth of inquiry into practice and consideration of outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing strategies that will further support and strengthen the educators' practices, including the implementation of <em>Te Whāriki</em> and regular written feedback about good practice and what could be improved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen appraisal for ETLs.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Amanda's Homebased ECE completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>17 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
