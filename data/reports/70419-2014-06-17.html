</table><p>North Beach Community Childcare Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>North Beach Community Childcare Centre provides care and education for children aged from birth to school age. A centre manager is responsible for the daily operation of the centre. A board of parents and community members provides centre governance.</p><p>Since the March 2009 ERO review there have been changes to the centre manager position and some staff. Significant progress has been made in addressing the areas for improvement identified in the previous ERO review, particularly in the areas of the way the centre was managed and self review.</p><p>A new purpose-built facility, replacing the previous one damaged by the Canterbury earthquakes, is located on the grounds of a local school.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Features of the centre are:</p><ul>
<li>the strong commitment to supporting the values and culture of the local community</li>
<li>promoting the wellbeing of families</li>
<li>giving children regular opportunities to learn about their local community resources.</li>
</ul><p>The board, manager and teachers strongly advocate for children and their families.</p><p>The centre has good links with the local school to extend children’s learning and support them to have a successful transition to school. Teachers are sharing useful information about children’s learning, interests and strengths with the school’s new entrant teacher.</p><p>The centre has a spacious, purpose-built environment. Teachers purposefully set up the environment and add additional resources based on children’s interests. Children have good opportunities to use natural resources in their play.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to follow their play interests. Teachers listen to children, respond to their preferences and support children to make their own choices within the programme.</p><p>ERO observed teachers interacting with children in respectful, positive and affirming ways. They know the children and their families well and use this information to make their conversations with children more meaningful. Nursery teachers effectively support infants and toddlers to develop their language skills. Many teachers make good use of their conversations with children to ask questions and help children think more about their ideas.</p><p>Teachers:</p><ul>
<li>are aware of the additional learning needs of children and ensure these children are well supported in, and able to access, the programme</li>
<li>actively find ways to support the children’s families in their day-to-day living</li>
<li>are increasing their knowledge of Pacific learners, their families and their culture.</li>
</ul><p>There are positive relationships between teachers and whānau. Parents have good opportunities to contribute to self review. Parent contribution to the programme is valued by the teachers. Children’s learning is benefiting from parent contributions in aspects of te reo and tikanga Māori.</p><p>Recent planning and assessment developments are helping teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>identify and develop a shared understanding of centre values</li>
<li>have more in-depth conversations and share knowledge about children’s learning, interests and strengths</li>
<li>be more purposeful in the way they write learning stories for children and parents</li>
<li>improve practice by providing useful feedback to each other on the quality of their learning stories.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers benefit from regular opportunities to increase their professional knowledge. Professional learning and development is well targeted to teacher appraisal and whole centre goals. These opportunities are helping teachers to reflect more deeply on aspects of their practice. This is supporting a learning culture within the teaching team.</p><p>The board is strengthening its governance of the centre. It is planning well for the future and making good use of external advice and guidance in this process. The board is aware of community changes, such as school mergers, and has identified the opportunities these changes may provide for the centre.</p><p>The manager is growing leadership skills among staff so that responsibilities are shared and staff strengths are recognised and well used. This is enhancing children’s learning, supporting the teaching team and promoting centre improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager and teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps to improve outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to develop planning and assessment</li>
<li>increasing teachers’ knowledge, understanding and use of Māori perspectives and language to support Māori children to achieve success as Māori</li>
<li>placing more emphasis on reviewing and evaluating the quality of interactions in self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of North Beach Community Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of North Beach Community Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>17 June 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
