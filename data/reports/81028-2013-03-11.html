<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Outram Playcentre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Outram Playcentre is a small centre on the Taieri Plains next to the Outram school. The centre provides four sessions a week for up to 25 children aged from birth to five years. One session is an extension session for older children. Many of the current parents have a long-standing involvement in, and relationship with, the centre. The sessions are led by an educator who has been there for many years. The parents are actively involved in the governance and management of the centre. They have used self review to address some of the recommendations of the previous review, improving the bicultural dimension being one of them. As a result, there is now a greater use of te reo M&#257;ori in the centre and evidence in the programme of a bicultural dimension.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in fifteen early childhood education services within the Otago Playcentre Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The high level of parent involvement in the running of the playcentre fosters strong relationships between the families that attend. Children and their families are warmly welcomed on arrival. Older children enjoy strong friendships with each other. Younger children play well on their own. The adults know the children well. They work attentively with the children, helping them to develop their thinking through good questioning and support to problem solve. They praise the children&rsquo;s efforts and encourage them to take risks. The educator has some very good interactions with children to extend their thinking and imaginative play.</p><p>Children play and learn in attractive and well-resourced indoor and outdoor environments. They have many opportunities to visit the Outram School next door while they are at playcentre. For example, school concerts, singing time and visits to the school library. This helps them to be confident and make smooth transitions to school when the time comes.</p><p>Children enjoy a wide range of experiences. These include trips into the community such as the nearby Berwick reservoir, participating in the Outram spring and autumn flower shows, and a strong focus on early-literacy and numeracy in the centre programme. A strength of the centre is the way that the parent council has effectively used self review to make improvements to aspects of the programme and practices. A best-practice example is the comprehensive review of the role of the information officer and subsequently a review of the centre office-bearer roles.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The parents agree that the next step is to develop a schedule of self review to align with the priorities of the strategic plan.</p><p>The centre has proactively developed strategies to ensure succession planning of roles and responsibilities when families move on from the centre. A five-year strategic plan and well-thought-out goals inform a useful annual plan which guides the centre&rsquo;s operations.</p><p>There are very good systems for planning and assessing children&rsquo;s learning. Every three weeks the educator plans for a new group of children. Some of the activities she provides within the sessions are intended to advance the learning of the focus group. For example, the visit from Sport Otago was in response to an identified need to build the girls&rsquo; physical skills.</p><p>Many parents are involved in the daily programme as parent helps to set up the environment and work with their own and small groups of children. However, few parents have completed sufficient levels of playcentre training to effectively support and contribute to the teaching and learning programme. Profile books are attractive records of children&rsquo;s learning and experiences but few parents contribute to these records of learning.</p><p>It is time for the centre to review the centre philosophy and practices to better align with the philosophy of the Playcentre Movement. The Centre Advisor has identified and ERO agrees that the centre needs to consider how it develops strategies to ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>sufficient numbers of parents are completing playcentre training</li>
<li>parents are more actively involved in planning, assessing and evaluating their children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>there is a greater focus on emergent leadership for learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Governance and Management</h3><p>The Otago Playcentre Association (OPA) provides a comprehensive range of support to this and other playcentres. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>developing an action plan for all centres to be relicensed with the 2008 Regulations</li>
<li>managing an association-wide system for all aspects of health, safety and compliance</li>
<li>ongoing support for employment processes</li>
<li>targeted support for playcentres requiring additional assistance</li>
<li>ongoing provision of playcentre training.</li>
</ul><p>The OPA executive and personnel hold regular meetings with a specific focus on each centre. They discuss best ways to support individual centres. Records from these meetings could be more specific about what support is provided and the difference it has made.</p><p>A strength of the OPA is the ongoing support provided by the Centre Advisors. The centre advisor effectively supports the parents and educators in developing their understanding of planning and assessment and self review.</p><p>Centre advisors should continue to build their knowledge and understanding of self review. They should use each centre's self review as evidence to assure the governors of the OPA how well the playcentre is promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>OPA personnel need to further develop their understanding of self review and use the findings to assure themselves of the effectiveness of their strategic goals and all aspects of the OPA management and operations.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Outram Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>11 March 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
