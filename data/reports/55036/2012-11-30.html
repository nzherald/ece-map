<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Te Whare Aroha o Ng&#257; Mokopuna is developing its capacity to provide positive outcomes for children.</p><h4>Context</h4><p>The centre is a well established community centre in the Flaxmere suburb of Hastings. It has a clear focus on providing accessible childcare for families in a low socio-economic area in response to provision of equity funding. The centre has recently increased its capacity to cater for 70 children from a range of culturally diverse backgrounds, most of whom identify as Pacific or M&#257;ori.</p><p>Centre staff are welcoming, caring and approachable. They know children and their families well and value their cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The centre is governed by a parent committee and managed by a supervisor who oversees each of the three age groups in their designated areas. Of the 21 staff, seven are registered teachers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and demonstrate a strong sense of belonging in the centre. They are supported to play positively and cooperatively and interact confidently with adults. Well established and consistently implemented routines provide a structure for the day. The routines promote healthy practices, helping children to be self-managing.</p><p>The child's identity, language and culture are highly valued. Languages and symbols of children&rsquo;s cultural backgrounds are respected and celebrated. Teachers and children are supported to use Pacific languages and te reo M&#257;ori appropriately and regularly. Wh&#257;nau, aiga and koputangagta have opportunities to share their cultural taonga in the centre.</p><p>The programme has a focus on healthy practices and promotes children&rsquo;s developing independence. Nourishing meals are provided. Frequent excursions within the local and wider community, well supported by families, enrich children&rsquo;s learning. These initiatives are supported by allocated equity funding.</p><p>Children are free to follow their interests and explore the indoor and outdoor environments in three distinct spaces. Regular opportunities are provided for children of different ages to play together. Individual portfolios celebrate children&rsquo;s participation in the programme.</p><p>To enrich the implementation of the curriculum, centre staff should:</p><ul>
<li>establish a shared understanding of effective early education practice and promote teachers&rsquo; ability to respond more deliberately to deepen and progress children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>develop a centre-wide, integrated approach to literacy and numeracy, supported by rich opportunities in the programme, interactions and environment</li>
<li>continue to develop assessment practices to clearly identify children&rsquo;s learning and show they make progress over time.</li>
</ul><p>Regular team meetings provide opportunities for centre staff to share children&rsquo;s learning and reflect on practice. The revised appraisal system provides teachers with feedback on their teaching in relation to professional criteria. Further refinement of appraisal processes, including the use of evidence and observations, should better guide and strengthen teacher development.</p><p>Self-review has been strengthened. External support has helped staff to use an appropriate process to guide improvement of centre programmes and practices. Curriculum reviews are well considered, consultative, gather relevant evidence, and result in positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The next step for the centre is to further embed self review. This should include stronger links to best early childhood education practice, ensuring recommendations are put into action, and evaluation of the extent to which intended outcomes have been achieved.</p><p>The parent committee is very supportive of the centre and value its staff and community. Members are representative of the community and recognise the strengths of the centre. They demonstrate a genuine interest in promoting children's learning and wellbeing. Opportunities are planned for improving committee members&rsquo; understanding of their governance roles and responsibilities.</p><p>Further work needs to occur to foster positive working relationships with management and staff. ERO recommends management ensure clear processes are developed for sharing information and collaborative decision-making with staff and committee members.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Whare Aroha O Nga Mokopuna Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>30 November 2012</p><p>&nbsp;</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

</table><h3>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h3><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p><h4>Disclaimer</h4><p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p></html>
