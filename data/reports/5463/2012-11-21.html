<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Wigram is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens administers 62 kindergartens and one early learning centre in Canterbury and the West Coast. An education services manager works with each kindergarten giving feedback and professional support. This kindergarten provides a strong bicultural programme. Families from a diverse range of cultures attend the kindergarten. The cultural backgrounds of all children and families are recognised and celebrated. All teachers employed by Kidsfirst Kindergartens are fully qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in eight kindergartens and one early childhood education services within the Kidsfirst Kindergartens umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Children benefit from teachers and families working in partnership to support their learning. Teachers acknowledge children&rsquo;s cultural identity. They have an in-depth knowledge of each child and their family. They value parent contributions and successfully use this information to link home and kindergarten learning. Parents enjoy spending time in the programme, sharing their cultures and contributing to their children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Children, teachers and families are proud of the way te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori are included in the programme. The head teacher is a strong advocate. It is well integrated into all aspects of the programme. It is well integrated into all aspects of teaching and learning.</p><p>Children are actively engaged in meaningful learning. Teachers make good use of their ongoing observations of children to introduce new learning opportunities, extend interests and join in children&rsquo;s play to increase learning.</p><p>Teachers respond sensitively to children. They take time to listen and talk to them. They use a range of effective teaching practices to help children understand and apply their learning. Children&rsquo;s language development is well supported. Learning opportunities that help children prepare for school are meaningful and appropriate.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s learning is displayed in interesting ways. The large number of photographs and clear text explains the learning in ways that are meaningful for children and families.</p><p>Recent planning developments focus on the ways that children learn and how teachers could help children extend their learning further. Children&rsquo;s progress is carefully documented on the programme plan.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively and use their individual strengths to extend children&rsquo;s interests and learning. The kindergarten vision reflects what teachers consider important for children&rsquo;s learning and is evident in the programme. Teacher appraisal goals are usually challenging and incorporate individual teachers&rsquo; interests and next steps for professional development.</p><p>Under the strong and committed leadership of the head teacher, self review is used effectively to identify what is going well and where further improvements can be made. Self-review information is well analysed. Plans to improve outcomes for children are carefully monitored and regularly reported to parents.</p><p>The education services manager (ESM) has high expectations, promotes leadership and gives direction that helps teachers use research to continue to improve their knowledge and understanding of children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens has a well developed policy and practice framework to support the daily and long-term operation of the kindergarten. The association is kept well informed about the work of the kindergarten. Kidsfirst managers have recently developed a new process for reviewing and reporting kindergarten information. This process is likely to help them further target their support to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>The Kidsfirst Kindergartens&rsquo; manager and the teaching team have identified, and ERO agrees,. that the next steps to improve learning outcomes for children include strengthening assessment by:</p><ul>
<li>involving children more in the process</li>
<li>clearly identifying next steps for learning</li>
<li>keeping the learning stories simple and easy to read.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Wigram completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>21 November 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><h3>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h3><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
