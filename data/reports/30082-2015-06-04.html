</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Tauranga is located in the Greerton suburb of Tauranga, Bay of Plenty. The service operates under the management umbrella of Kidicorp Ltd, a privately owned organisation with centres throughout New Zealand. It is an all-day education and care service licensed for 45 children, including a maximum of 15 up to two years of age. Children learn and play in two age-group areas, each with an outdoor playground developed to meet their learning needs. Currently there are 57 children on the roll, 19 of whom identify as Māori.</p><p>The previous ERO review in 2012 identified that the centre had made significant improvement to the quality of education and care. The teaching team has continued to make progress, and has established a shared philosophy, agreed strategic direction, and robust self-review processes. These developments are in accord with the recommendations from the 2012 ERO review and reflect the company’s standards, vision and values.</p><p>There have been changes to staffing since the last ERO review. The centre manager and two teaching staff have continued in the same roles, while there have been changes to the staff for infants and toddlers. One of these changes is the result of a promotion to another centre, and the other is for maternity leave. The centre classrooms have been renovated and the outdoor areas have been substantially upgraded.</p><p>A strong focus on self review has contributed to environmental changes to further support the curriculum, and to make progress in planning for bicultural practices. The centre is continuing to work as part of a cluster of centres to strengthen planning and assessment practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are positive, confident learners who communicate well with each other and with teachers. They have a strong sense of identity and enjoy playing and learning in a positive, trusting environment. Teachers join actively in play and exploration to support and extend children’s experiences, and model expectations and possibilities. Infants and toddlers benefit from sensitive and responsive teachers who establish trusting relationships with children and their families. ERO reviewers observed calm, thoughtful teaching interactions that acknowledge children’s interests and respect their preferences and choices.</p><p>Teachers have recently focused on building reciprocal relationships with family, whānau and the wider community. They encourage parents to be active partners in their children’s learning, and use a variety of ways to welcome parents and include them in events and celebrations. Families appreciate that these occasions include and highlight the diverse cultures represented in the centre, particularly Māori and Indian.</p><p>The curriculum reflects children’s changing interests, and is supported by well resourced and attractively presented indoor and outdoor environments. The centre has focused on developing and refining aspects of the natural environment, which includes native plantings, and fosters children’s interactions with the living world. Children have authentic and meaningful learning opportunities. All children, including infants and toddlers, have increasing opportunities to experience trips and excursions into the local and wider community. Aspects of literacy and mathematics are embedded in the programme through the use of equipment such as games, puzzles, books, art and music.</p><p>A variety of bicultural practices is included in the curriculum, including karakia for kai, waiata, and the display of photographs and pepeha that support children’s identity. The bicultural curriculum would be further strengthened by maintaining an emphasis on building teachers’ capability in te reo and understanding of the cultural heritage that Māori tamariki bring with them.</p><p>Children’s transitions into the centre, from the infant’s area to the younger children’s one, and then to school, are managed effectively to maintain children’s confident participation. The centre has established positive relationships with the local school, and children are well-prepared for ongoing learning through the <em>Be School Ready</em> programme. A feature of this centre is the way that the manager and her staff advocate for the learning and health needs of children requiring additional assistance. Teachers use appropriate strategies to respond sensitively to support children’s social interactions, independence and self-management skills.</p><p>Planning, assessment and evaluation processes increasingly include children’s voices and show their learning and progress over time. Parents receive rich information about the programme and their children’s engagement through displays, well-presented portfolios and online information. Teachers value parents’ aspirations for their children and include them in their plans for each child’s learning and development.</p><p>The centre manager strongly promotes the centre’s overall vision, which is to provide children, parents and the community with a sense of belonging, inclusion and ownership. Supported by the head teacher, she has developed a collegial, high-trust model and climate among staff. These leaders work collaboratively to model, support and develop the quality of professional practice. Leadership is shared among staff, and well-planned professional development is building teachers’ capacity to fulfil a variety of roles. Well-developed performance appraisal encourages teacher reflection, provides them with feedback about their practice, and offers them opportunities to share their skills and celebrate one anothers’ successes.</p><p>Kidicorp, through the professional service and business managers, empowers the centre manager to operate the business successfully and further develop its strong social outreach to the community. The organisations’ clear self-review processes are used effectively for ongoing improvements to centre practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and ERO and centre leaders agree on the following next steps for development.</p><p>Leaders and teachers should continue to further build up bicultural practices by:</p><ul>
<li>developing connections with local iwi</li>
<li>exploring Māori history in the local area</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen teacher capability with tikanga and te reo Māori.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Tauranga completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Tauranga will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>4 June 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
