<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><p>Owaka Playcentre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Owaka Playcentre is one of 37 playcentres administered by the Otago Playcentre Association (OPA). The centre provides two morning sessions a week for up to 25 children aged birth-to-five years. The centre is located close to the Owaka Area School and the town&rsquo;s facilities. This small playcentre has very strong community links. Some of the parents attended the playcentre as children.</p><p>A major focus in 2012 has been to prepare for relicensing the centre in 2013. The centre has received good community support with fundraising to make the necessary improvements. As a result the parents have not been in a position to fully address the recommendations of the previous report. The findings in this report build on those of the April 2009 report.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in fifteen early childhood education services within the OPA umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their parents benefit from strong and positive relationships with one another. The adults know the children well and make meaningful connections to their lives outside of the centre. The children have good friendships with each other. They play for long periods of time together in complex play. The centre provides good support for children with diverse needs.</p><p>A strength of the playcentre is the way that the adults follow the children&rsquo;s interests and provide many experiences in and out of the centre to enrich and extend these interests. For example, the older boys&rsquo; interest in hunting was extended by visiting the army barracks in Dunedin and visiting a maimai in the duck shooting season. The children are developing very strong connections with the local community. They often go on outings to places such as the school, bike park and swimming pool.</p><p>The adults have nurturing conversations with the children and support them well in their play. The centre environment is comfortable, well resourced and very welcoming.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s profile books are effective records of their time at playcentre. The children enjoy these and regularly refer to them. The educators and parents have made a good start to noticing children&rsquo;s interests and recognising the learning that may be occurring. The next step is to record more carefully the progress children make over time and how the adults extend children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>The centre is efficiently run by a small group of very dedicated and organised parents. They have a high workload. In order to address this they should find ways to prioritise what they need to do. Key priorities for the parents to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the playcentre are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to participate in ongoing playcentre training</li>
<li>ensure that fundraising efforts are targeted to support identified centre initiatives.</li>
</ul><p>The April 2009 ERO report identified that in-depth self review processes need to be developed. ERO found that this is still the case. The parents and educator need to develop a schedule for reviews and find ways to carry out self review that are manageable and useful. Aspects of the programme that should be reviewed immediately include:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing the centre philosophy to ensure it is evident in action and reflects the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand</li>
<li>how adults plan and assess children&rsquo;s learning and show their progress over time.</li>
</ul><h3>Governance and Management</h3><p>The Otago Playcentre Association (OPA) provides a comprehensive range of support to this and other playcentres. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>developing an action plan for all centres to be relicensed with the 2008 Regulations</li>
<li>managing an association-wide system for all aspects of health, safety and compliance</li>
<li>ongoing support for employment processes</li>
<li>targeted support for playcentres requiring additional assistance</li>
<li>ongoing provision of playcentre training.</li>
</ul><p>The OPA executive and personnel hold regular meetings with a specific focus on each centre. They discuss best ways to support individual centres. Records from these meetings could be more specific about what support is provided and the difference it has made.</p><p>A strength of the OPA is the ongoing support provided by the centre advisors. The centre advisor effectively supports the parents and educators in developing their understanding of planning and assessment and self review.</p><p>Centre advisors should continue to build their knowledge and understanding of self review. They should use each centre's self review as evidence to assure the governors of the OPA how well the playcentre is promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>OPA personnel need to further develop their understanding of self review and use of the findings to assure themselves of the effectiveness of their strategic goals and operations.</p><p>The OPA governors have a sound policy framework to support the playcentre.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h4>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h4><p>Before the review, the management of Owaka Playcentre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>27 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
