</table><p>Kinderland Educare is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kinderland Educare in Mangere provides for up to 72 children up to school age. Many children speak more than one language. As noted in ERO's 2015 report, there are well-established relationships with the local primary school, which shares the centre's approaches in catering for the largely Muslim community.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is aligned to <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and emphasises a strong commitment to blending Islamic values, child-led play, biculturalism and Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Teachers believe in respecting and enhancing the physical, emotional, social and spiritual development of each child.</p><p>The centre has five registered teachers, a teacher in training, an administration support person and a cook. The centre director/owner works closely with a manager to lead the centre.</p><p>Since the 2015 ERO review, a new building has been opened on an adjacent site for children over three years of age. Programmes for children under three are in the original building. The manager and teachers have engaged in intensive professional development to enrich the curriculum and their own teaching practices. Good community relationships continue to be a strength.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers celebrate children’s cultural diversity, use home languages and affirm children’s cultural identities. They have a genuine commitment to being inclusive and providing a bicultural curriculum. Te reo and tikanga Māori are woven into routines, conversations, waiata and dance. Respectful, trusting relationships between teachers and families contribute to the sense of community in the centre.</p><p>Attractively presented assessment and planning documents show how children’s group and individual interests and strengths shape the programme. Children’s portfolios are highly valued and show the development of their interests and learning over time.</p><p>Teachers are supportive and caring. They interact skilfully and sustain conversations, often in children's home language. This contributes to children being confident, capable learners. Children have good opportunities to explore literacy, numeracy, and science through play. They play cooperatively, have leadership opportunities and show empathy for others. Teachers foster children’s social competence, and their communication and problem-solving skills.</p><p>Children learn in a vibrant, well-resourced learning environment that supports their sustained engagement in play and encourages creativity and imagination. Thoughtfully presented play areas encourage children to explore and make choices. Easy access to the outdoors promotes good opportunities for physical challenge and active play. Children's work and whānau photographs are prominently displayed. The multicultural backgrounds of the families and community are strongly evident throughout the centre. Children show a strong sense of belonging and eagerness to learn.</p><p>Teachers actively encourage parent and whānau partnership in children’s learning and development. Whānau are invited to share their knowledge and ideas, and teachers respond to parent aspirations. The centre has strong connections with the local community and schools. Children’s transition into and through the centre and on to school is sensitively supported.</p><p>Responsive teaching supports infants’ and toddlers’ need for strong and secure attachments. Infants benefit from nurturing, individualised care. Toddlers have space and encouragement to explore, develop independence and revisit past activities.</p><p>Strong professional leadership enables the centre to maintain its focus on providing high quality early childhood education and care. Positive working relationships, mentoring and collaboration between management and staff, help contribute to a culture of trust and respect. Opportunities for teachers' leadership and professional development are provided.</p><p>Sound governance and management systems include effective recordkeeping, evidence of professional discussion, and a comprehensive framework of policies and procedures. Strategic goals, aligned to the centre vision statement and centre philosophy, are clearly outlined. Centre leaders are aware they could strengthen the evaluative aspects of internal evaluation as a tool to enhance service provision and teaching practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers identified areas for ongoing development that include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>enrich kaupapa Māori practices, including the use of assessment from a Māori perspective</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a local curriculum that reflects the centre's own special character and values</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen evaluative thinking and reasoning to strengthen internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen appraisal procedures and practices to better align to current Teaching Council criteria.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kinderland Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>9 September 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
