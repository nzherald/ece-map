<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Cotswold Avenue is located in the suburb of Bishopdale in Christchurch. Since the October 2008 ERO review, the kindergarten has changed its operating hours and staffing. The kindergarten currently operates all day and half day sessions for up to 40 children over the age of two years old. All teachers are fully qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>It is one of 62 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates a management layer in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who works in partnership with teachers providing ongoing educational leadership and professional development.</p><p>Positive features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>the emphasis teachers place on supporting a sense of well-being and belonging for children and their families</li>
<li>a programme that enables children to follow their interests, make choices and play for long periods of time</li>
<li>a wide range of activities for children to extend their skills and interests in creative and physical play</li>
<li>the way parents are sharing their skills and interests in the programme.</li>
</ul><p>The next steps for the teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>extend children&rsquo;s thinking and learning, including their understanding of te reo M&#257;ori</li>
<li>strengthen programme planning and assessment practices so that children&rsquo;s learning is more clearly identified</li>
<li>develop stronger systems of self-review to guide kindergarten improvements.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Cotswold was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergartens Cotswold.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h5>Background</h5><p>Teachers focus on providing a curriculum that is based on supporting children&rsquo;s interests and strengths. Teachers view their role as working collaboratively with children to extend their learning, including their life skills and independence. Teachers believe that working in partnership with parents enriches the kindergarten programme.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><h4>Sense of well-being</h4><p>Children and their families benefit from teachers&rsquo; support of their well-being and sense of belonging. Teachers relate to children in positive and affirming ways. In 2011 teachers successfully raised their awareness of recognising children&rsquo;s specific cultural identities within the kindergarten programme and involving these children&rsquo;s parents more. Parents have contributed to the programme in ways that have extended children&rsquo;s experiences.</p><p>Teachers have responded with sensitivity to children and families following the Christchurch earthquakes. The strong focus in the programme on well-being and belonging is part of this response. Teachers talk positively with children about their earthquake experiences and support these interests in their play. They are focused on encouraging resilience in children and their families.</p><h5>Confident children</h5><p>ERO observed children who confidently took part in the kindergarten programme. They played well independent of adults and often chose to play with other children. Children stayed at activities for sustained periods of time.</p><h5>Daily programme</h5><p>Children experience a daily programme that allows them to make choices about what they want to do and when. This is supporting children to follow their own interests, become more involved in their play choices, and extend their ideas throughout the day.</p><h5>Creative learning</h5><p>Children make good use of the programme and resources to support their creative and physical play. Teachers provide resources that can be used in many different ways to support children&rsquo;s interests and foster their imagination. Teachers work effectively alongside children, help them try new things, ask questions to help children extend their ideas, and support children to work with others successfully.</p><h5>Range of activities</h5><p>Teachers provide a good range of activities for children. This includes regular access to aspects of technology, such as laptops and an electronic microscope. Teachers attractively record children&rsquo;s participation in the programme through learning stories. These records are displayed so that they are easily accessible to children and their families.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><h5>Programme planning and assessment</h5><p>Programme planning and assessment needs strengthening to make children&rsquo;s learning more visible.</p><p>For assessment this includes teachers:</p><ul>
<li>following up individual children&rsquo;s progress to show how learning has been supported</li>
<li>making better use of parent and children&rsquo;s aspirations in assessment practices</li>
<li>making stronger links between assessment and programme planning.</li>
</ul><p>For programme planning this includes teachers:</p><ul>
<li>planning for learning rather than activities</li>
<li>planning to use more focused teaching strategies</li>
<li>evaluating the effectiveness of these strategies.</li>
</ul><h5>Bicultural perspectives</h5><p>Teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that while te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori is visible in displays in the environment, they could further improve the ways they use te reo M&#257;ori within the programme.</p><h5>Self review</h5><p>Teachers are provided with good templates to review the curriculum. They could make better use of these processes by more clearly identifying a reflective question, developing indicators, and determining desired outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers could use a wider of range of research and information sources to inform their decisions about self review and better document the information they collect.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Cotswold completed an ERO CentreManagement Assurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the kindergarten&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><p>11 May 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-cotswold" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Cotswold</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kidsfirst Kindergartens Cotswold.</p><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Cotswold Avenue is located in the suburb of Bishopdale in Christchurch. Since the October 2008 ERO review, the kindergarten has changed its operating hours and staffing. The kindergarten currently operates all day and half day sessions for up to 40 children over the age of two years old. All teachers are fully qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>It is one of 62 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates a management layer in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who works in partnership with teachers providing ongoing educational leadership and professional development.</p><p>Positive features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>the emphasis teachers place on supporting a sense of well-being and belonging for children and their families</li>
<li>a programme that enables children to follow their interests, make choices and play for long periods of time</li>
<li>a wide range of activities for children to extend their skills and interests in creative and physical play</li>
<li>the way parents are sharing their skills and interests in the programme.</li>
<li>The next steps for the teachers are to:</li>
<li>extend children&rsquo;s thinking and learning, including their understanding of te reo M&#257;ori</li>
<li>strengthen programme planning and assessment practices so that children&rsquo;s learning is more clearly identified</li>
<li>develop stronger systems of self-review to guide kindergarten improvements.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
