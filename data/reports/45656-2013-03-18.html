<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The centre is becoming better placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Kinderhaven Preschool Henderson Central opened two years ago and this is its first ERO review. The centre is licensed for 39 children over two years of age. Although the centre is open all day, parents generally take advantage of the Ministry of Education&rsquo;s 20 hours ECE by enrolling their children for morning or afternoon sessions, or for sessions from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.</p><p>The centre has a supervisor and a team of teachers. It is one of three operated by the same owners. The support and guidance of the organisation&rsquo;s group manager, along with stable and loyal staffing, have aided centre developments.</p><p>Teachers reflect a mix of the cultures of the local community. They form a positive team that is focused on promoting children&rsquo;s overall development and well being, and valuing the partnership they have with families. Teachers take very good care of children and are interested in promoting their learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre has a very positive tone. All children are welcomed, valued and included in the programme. Children are treated with dignity and respect, and experience an unhurried and relaxed programme. They enjoy positive and affirming relationships with teachers and each other. They settle quickly into the centre, selecting activities and playing confidently on their own or with others, often for good lengths of time. Children are content and well cared for, and approach adults with confidence.</p><p>Teachers are making good progress in enhancing the quality of the learning environment. An attractive indoor space gives children easy access to learning resources. Well developed centre displays highlight children&rsquo;s learning experiences and acknowledge their creative efforts. Although some programme themes are adult selected, teachers generally involve children in suitable learning experiences. Records of these experiences are shared electronically with parents.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to children&rsquo;s interests during the day. They talk freely to children, helping them to extend their social interactions, their language and their learning. Teachers recognise the language, culture and identity of M&#257;ori children and seek ways to include these aspects in the programme. They integrate early literacy and numeracy learning opportunities through play and incidental learning situations. These informal language and numeracy learning opportunities reflect best practice in early childhood education. Teachers have made contact with local schools as a means of supporting children&rsquo;s successful transition to school.</p><p>The organisation&rsquo;s group manager provides strong governance and leadership support. Through her efforts, the centre&rsquo;s development has been effectively guided and overseen in strategic, inclusive and respectful ways. The group manager engages in thorough professional reflection, and has established strong policies, procedures and internal self-review processes to promote centre improvement.</p><p>As key next steps, ERO and centre leaders discussed the value of:</p><ul>
<li>helping teachers increase their understanding and application of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, and of latest developments in programme planning, assessment and evaluation</li>
<li>ensuring that the centre and its programme increasingly reflect the special attributes, strengths and interests of children and their families, and the local community</li>
<li>developing the quantity, quality and challenge of learning opportunities, especially those provided in the outdoors area</li>
<li>building on opportunities for children to been seen as capable and competent learners, developing their independence and helping them be leaders of their own learning.</li>
</ul><p>ERO and centre managers also agreed that next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>making outcomes for children the focus of curriculum self review and programme evaluations</li>
<li>increasing centre networks in the local community.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kinderhaven Preschool Henderson Central completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>18 March 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
