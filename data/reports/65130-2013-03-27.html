<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Busy Bees is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Busy Bees, in Nelson city, is a well-planned, mixed-aged service where children from birth to five years are nurtured and educated. Siblings play and learn together, sharing routines and centre practices. They also have the opportunity and space to choose to play with their peers and the wider group. A family atmosphere is evident.</p><p>Since the 2009 ERO review, the centre has changed its ownership and name. It is now owned by the licensee who works with a centre manager and supervisor. This team has specific, designated responsibilities for oversight of children&rsquo;s learning and care, and centre-wide management and organisation.</p><p>The philosophy is reviewed regularly. It is the guiding document that supports theory and practice within the centre. Families are an integral part of how Busy Bees implements the programme, based on <em>Te Whariki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. If the centre is part of a cluster review, select context from drop-down. Delete this field if not used</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children lead their own learning, effectively supported by staff. They have respectful relationships with each other and adults. Social development is highly valued by teachers and families. Children negotiate and problem-solve. They are included in decision-making that affects their comfort, learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Families are warmly welcomed and embraced as key partners in their children&rsquo;s education. Well supported with opportunities to share their aspirations, families know their opinions are heard and appropriately actioned. Formal and informal communication is used effectively to share information about each child&rsquo;s care and learning. Regular evening events provide opportunities for families to mix together, become more familiar with staff and learn more about the programme provided for children. There is a genuine sense of respect, trust and willingness to share and listen among staff and parents.</p><p>Shared understandings of the centre philosophy are modelled by leaders and visible in day-to-day action. High expectations for the learning and wellbeing of all children and ongoing centre improvement are evident. The outcomes of recent self review, including teacher appraisal, have been used to improve centre-wide practice. This learning builds on the shared understandings among staff about teaching and children's learning.</p><p>The collaborative and mutually respectful culture benefits children. Teachers discuss how to best meet children&rsquo;s specific developmental, learning and cultural needs. They document milestones, sharing children's progress, growth and learning overtime with families.</p><p>Staff are aware of the value of a bicultural curriculum for children. They are developing their own knowledge by learning te reo M&#257;ori and aspects of te ao M&#257;ori. Some staff members are leading culturally-responsive teaching and learning.</p><p>It is timely that teachers explore how well the curriculum supports M&#257;ori children to experience success as Maori.</p><p>Strategic and annual plans are well aligned. Leaders and staff use self review to inform decisions and make changes for the better. Long-term reviews are well considered, planned, systematic, researched, and thoroughly documented. Parents, wh&#257;nau and staff all contribute to the findings. Spontaneous reviews are well informed and actions are taken in a timely manner.</p><p>The leadership team and ERO agree that the next step for sustaining and improving effectiveness is to evaluate the impact of changes already made.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Busy Bees completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><p><strong>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</strong></p><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p><img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>27 March 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
