<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Maraetai Beachlands Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Maraetai Beachlands Kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association. The Association provides policy, procedures and guidelines to support the operation of the service. It also provides teachers with regular, topical professional development and ongoing support from professional support managers (PSMs).</p><p>The kindergarten operates a child focused, resource-based programme, as outlined in their philosophy. Teachers encourage children&rsquo;s independent exploration and learning. The kindergarten has a positive ERO reporting history.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in six early childhood education services within the Auckland Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers use external and internal review to evaluate the effectiveness of kindergarten operations. The teaching team sets short term and longer term strategic plans and parents are invited to contribute to decisions about the direction of the kindergarten. Teachers plan to participate in professional development to learn how to better document self review of the kindergarten&rsquo;s practices and operations.</p><p>Leadership opportunities for children, parents and teachers are fostered. Parents provide leadership roles on the parent committee. Children may direct their own play to solve problems, or look for resources to extend their interests. Teachers work well together as a team, sharing leadership roles and responsibilities. Regular professional learning and development provides teachers with a sound base for professional discussions about their work.</p><p>Teachers use many strategies to enhance children&rsquo;s learning. These are particularly evident in work to develop children&rsquo;s understanding of literacy and numeracy concepts, and of basic te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori. To further develop teachers' knowledge to promote higher learning outcomes for M&#257;ori children, teachers, with Association support, could also use the Ministry of Education resource <em>Tataiako, cultural competencies for teachers of M&#257;ori learners.</em></p><p>Teachers create inviting learning environments to stimulate children&rsquo;s curiosity and encourage exploration. Many opportunities are provided to help children to develop physical, social and thinking skills.</p><p>Since the teaching team were last appraised, the Association has updated the appraisal document. Appraisal is now linked to the Registered Teacher Criteria. Teachers intend using the new document for their next appraisals</p><h3>Key next steps</h3><p>Teachers could now further strengthen teaching and learning by:</p><ul>
<li>supporting children to add more complexity to their learning</li>
<li>considering how they could support M&#257;ori children more effectively by learning more about M&#257;ori language, culture and identity</li>
<li>promoting children&rsquo;s diverse languages, cultures and identities within the programme</li>
<li>refining and linking programme planning, assessment, and work to evaluate the quality of teaching and learning</li>
<li>working in partnership with parents to implement effective practices to help all children become capable, confident learners and communicators.</li>
</ul><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s outdoor areas are expansive and difficult for two teachers to supervise while also providing a teacher-responsive and child-led programme. Teacher aide hours are provided by the Association to help teachers with non-teaching tasks, so that teachers are better able to focus on interactions with children. While this is a positive strategy for responding to the situation, teachers are engaging in discussions with the Association to explore options that could be more effective in supporting teachers to further improve the quality of the programme and deepen learning experiences for children.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Maraetai Beachlands Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>30 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
