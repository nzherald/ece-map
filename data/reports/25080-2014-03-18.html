</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Papakura East Community Kindy provides full day care and education for up to 39 children over two years of age. The centre, formerly known as ABC Developmental Learning Centre – Papakura, became part of the Kidicorp organisation in October 2012.</p><p>New management has implemented several changes including improvements to the environment and resources. There has been an almost complete change in staff. The Kidicorp management and personnel systems guide the operation of the centre and teachers are supported by a range of business, professional services and curriculum leaders. The centre leadership team has had less than a year in the centre. In this time they have led a review of the centre’s philosophy with the aim of establishing a cohesive approach to teaching and learning among teachers.</p><p>The centre has a strong focus on providing support for families and the community. A high proportion of families are Māori and centre leaders have established a meaningful relationship with Papakura Marae. The centre provides transport for a large number of the children who attend. Initiatives to cater for two year olds have resulted in increased participation by this age group. Staff, who are mostly registered teachers, reflect the cultures and diversity of the community. They have developed caring and respectful relationships with families.</p><p>In 2011 ERO identified several strengths and challenges in the centre. While supportive staff provided children with a sense of wellbeing and belonging, they were tested by behaviour issues, and a difficult physical environment. Improvements to planning and teaching were needed to enhance learning. The new teaching team is continuing work in these areas with a clear focus on creating positive outcomes for children and their families.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are generally happy and settled in the centre. They have trusting relationships with teachers and most are developing friendships with their peers. Children are responsive to teachers’ support for their play and often engage in conversations about their interests. They are learning to make choices about their play and work with others, taking turns and sharing equipment. Children are becoming familiar with routines that encourage them to be independent and self managing. Children appear relaxed and show a sense of feeling safe in this environment.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families well. They have a very strong focus on building relationships and establishing trust. They demonstrate a willingness to respond to family needs and this creates a positive foundation for developing a learning environment. Currently, children mostly play at a simple level enjoying physical and tactile activities. Teachers support this play with resources and interactions that prompt children’s ideas. Some teachers skilfully integrate te reo Māori in their conversations and recognise the importance of celebrating children's cultural identity.</p><p>Teachers have yet to establish formal programme planning and evaluation. They recognised the need for children to feel safe before challenging them with complex learning tasks. Teachers have developed simple strategies based on respect to guide children's behaviour. They have been heartened by significant improvements in children's care for each other and involvement in play. Teachers know they now need to be consistent and have high expectations that rules will respected.</p><p>Parents who spoke with ERO noted that they are very pleased with the welcome and support their children receive. They appreciate frequent feedback, the opportunities for siblings to play together and the recognition of their family needs. Initiatives such as the transport van, trading table and subsidies for two year olds have fostered parents’ involvement and commitment to early childhood education for their children. Parents could now make further use of their child’s assessment portfolio to become more active partners in their child’s learning.</p><p>The centre manager is well supported by Kidicorp to lead the centre. Regular meetings with other centre managers, professional development and mentoring opportunities encourage her to expect commitment and effort from staff. She has distributed responsibilities for self review and leading bicultural practices and encourages a collaborative approach to implementing the programme. The centre manager actively works with external agencies to provide maximum support for families and to ensure the centre is responsive to the social, emotional and physical needs of children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager, Kidicorp advisors and ERO agree that key next steps for the centre should include:</p><ul>
<li>an evaluation of the environment with a view to further improving the quality of resources, the arrangement of play areas and children's independent access to equipment</li>
<li>teachers having a focus on planning, assessment and evaluation in order to improve the quality of teaching and learning and to further engage families in their children's learning</li>
<li>streamlining management planning and documentation to provide a more cohesive approach to centre development and to make information more accessible</li>
<li>ongoing development of self-review processes to increase the depth and scope of reviews and to extend consultation processes to include families and children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Papakura East Community Kindy completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Papakura East Community Kindy will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>18 March 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
