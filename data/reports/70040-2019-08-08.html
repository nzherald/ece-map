</table><p>Cust-West Eyreton Playcentre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Cust-West Eyreton Playcentre operates as a parent cooperative under the governance and management of the Playcentre Federation, Upper South Island Region. This centre is licensed for up to 25 children, including 10 children under two. The centre is open three mornings a week. The Wednesday programme operates as an outdoor nature session to explore the wider community.</p><p>The playcentre employs a coordinator. Parents are rostered to help at each session. The Upper South Island Region employs a centre support person and an administrator who regularly visit the playcentre to support the parents and coordinator.</p><p>The centre's philosophy places a strong emphasis on the important role of parents in their children's learning and wellbeing. It identifies the significance of play for children to become confident and capable learners and leaders. It states that the centre should be visible in the wider community and have a 'strong sense of belonging to its community'.</p><p>At the beginning of 2019, a new centre coordinator was appointed. The parent cooperative has made good progress to meet the recommendations in the 2014 ERO report. This includes</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a strong parent cooperative being established</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation has improved and is more useful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bicultural understandings and inclusion in the programme have increased.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The parent cooperative has still to make connections with the local Māori community and make use of external support for this area of the ECE curriculum.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight playcentre reviews in the Playcentre Federation, Upper South Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident, respectful and inclusive of others. Adults effectively use a range of strategies to help children develop good social, listening and participation skills. Tuakana teina is evident in the interactions of older children with younger children.</p><p>Children are successful learners who know what they want to learn, where to seek support and the resources that they need. Adults encourage children to lead the learning. They regularly involve children in decisions about the programme. They often include children in evaluating what they have learnt and where improvements to learning and safety could be made. Parents empower children as learners by asking searching questions, joining their play as learning partners and promoting problem solving strategies.</p><p>Te reo and tikanga Māori are increasing in the programme. Internal evaluation has been used appropriately to identify where improvements can be made to improve the programme. To continue to improve their skills, knowledge and understanding of Māori language and culture the parent group should build relationships with local Māori. They should also participate regularly in professional development for this area of the curriculum.</p><p>Children's transition to school is well managed and appropriate for each child. Parents and children help to decide what skills, knowledge and understandings each child will develop further to ensure a smooth transition to school. The playcentre maintains a close relationship with the local primary school.</p><p>Children under two-years-old are well integrated into the programme. Appropriate resources are easy for them to access. The number of adults participating in each session ensures that children are well supported in their learning and physical wellbeing.</p><p>Assessment, planning and programme evaluation successfully involve parents and children and shows the:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>indepth knowledge parents share about individual children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wide range of experiences and activities provided</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>close links between home and centre learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>An increasing shared knowledge of the processes for assessment and planning should enable parents to be more involved in goal setting, evaluating learning outcomes, and capturing children's learning progress over time.</p><p>Internal evaluation is well used to collaboratively identify issues to increase understanding and make improvements. The parents now need to ensure they have a single process that is well understood by all members of the cooperative. More emphasis should also be given to the learning outcomes for children as a result of the improvements made.</p><p>The strategic plan is in the early stages of development. Goals have been identified and the change that could be expected if the goals were met. A process to monitor progress and to identify outcomes for children and adults has yet to be completed. This development should also help to make closer links between internal evaluation and the strategic plan.</p><p>The adults work effectively as a parent cooperative. Parents are valued for the skills and knowledge that they bring to the playcentre. Decision making and the operation of the playcentre involves all adults. Strong support from the Upper South Island Region and parents' commitment to the playcentre parent education programme ensures the playcentre philosophy is upheld. Best practices are evident in the programme and the operation of the playcentre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The Upper South Island Region, the playcentre and ERO agree that the key next steps for the parent cooperative to continue to improve outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>increasing parent understanding and knowledge of Te Whāriki 2017 to improve assessment planning and programme evaluation processes and practices</li>
<li>strengthening internal evaluation by ensuring that the process is well understood by all parents and builds evaluation capacity</li>
<li>making links with local Māori to continue to increase the use and understanding of te Ao Māori in the programme</li>
<li>continuing to develop and implement strategic planning to provide direction for continuing to improve outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Upper South Island Regional Governance</h3><p>There continues to be significant change occurring with the playcentre's governance and management at regional and federation levels.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Cust-West Eyreton Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>8 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
