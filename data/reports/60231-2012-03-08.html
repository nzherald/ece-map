<a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Raumati South Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>Raumati South Kindergarten is located on the Kapiti Coast, north of Wellington. Children, their families and teachers appreciate the purpose built facilities surrounded by extensive outdoor areas. This provides an exciting environment for learning. Dramatic and creative play areas encourage children to move freely, independently or with peers. Play resources are used flexibly to capture children’s interest and encourage problem solving and exploration.</p><p>The community and teachers are committed to providing children with authentic opportunities that promote sustainability, caring for animals and the environment. Teachers and children participate successfully in early childhood and the local school’s environmental initiatives. These accomplishments are integral to the learning programme. Displays of environmental events enable children and adults to revisit the learning from these experiences.</p><p>A positive, friendly tone is clearly evident throughout the kindergarten with children and teachers engaging in sustained conversations. Children persevere and enjoy activities with their peers for extended periods.</p><p>The kindergarten programme provides a wide range of learning opportunities for children to direct and maintain their own learning. Routines are appropriate for children’s care and well-being. Their choices in timing for eating, coming together and playing are respected and supported.</p><p>Teaching practices, such as understanding assessment and positive guidance programmes, encourage children to be capable and competent learners. Teachers are highly involved with children’s play. Their interactions with individuals and groups of children are a deliberate, measured approach where any intervention is carefully considered.</p><p>Families affirm the way teachers educate and care for children. They are welcomed and often participate with children at play. Teachers value the partnership they develop with parents, families and extended families.</p><p>Staff are committed to providing improved learning opportunities for children and their families. They have identified aspects of assessment and increasing teachers’ understanding of tikanga Māori are areas for development and review. ERO’s external evaluation findings concur with these directions. Increasing teachers understanding of the use of self review for ongoing improvement will assist them to evaluate the effectiveness of their practices.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Raumati South Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atRaumati South Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support.</li>
</ul><p>ERO’s findings in these areas are set out below</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The newly appointed head teacher is due to commence her role in early 2012. Until her arrival an acting head teacher provides support to the kindergarten staff and operations. The teaching team are a mixture of experienced and newer staff.</p><p>The focus on sustainable environments has been recognised by national awards.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>The high quality programme is supported by stimulating interactions and a well-considered learning environment. This is particularly evident in the:</p><ul>
<li>reflection of the kindergarten philosophy, vision and values across its operations</li>
<li>high interest spaces including garden and pet areas, for children to explore independently or with their peers</li>
<li>promotion of children’s negotiation, making choices and being independent learners</li>
<li>flexible use of inside and outside environments, supported by a well planned learning programme</li>
<li>warm relationships that contribute to a shared sense of ownership between children, families and teachers</li>
<li>families expressing trust that appropriate systems are in place to support their child to be safe, learning and growing</li>
<li>strong and collaborative teaching team</li>
<li>good teaching practices based on current research</li>
<li>kind, responsive and caring place where children’s well-being is the priority</li>
<li>way children are settled and play cooperatively with peers</li>
<li>skilful integration of literacy and numeracy across play areas to support children’s emerging skills</li>
<li>emphasis on science and nature learning</li>
<li>rich records of children’s interests and learning in portfolios,</li>
<li>teacher’s newly developed planning framework that provides a visual record of emergent learning</li>
<li>children’s engagement in many opportunities to be creative, supported through strong community participation.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers collaboratively consider improvements to ensure they provide quality education for children.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>Teachers agree that the following aspects of practice need development and review. ERO affirms these directions. In particular:</p><ul>
<li>incorporating te reo me ngā tikanga Māori through the environment, interactions and programme</li>
<li>continuing to make the learning more explicit in learning stories, improving assessment to include the children’s voice</li>
<li>further sharing the children’s learning and knowledge about sustainable environmental practices with families</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen teachers’ understanding and use of self review for ongoing improvement.</li>
</ul><h3>Association Support</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/whānau involvement and quality teaching practices</li>
<li>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te Manawa</li>
<li>a wide range of professional development opportunities</li>
<li>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</li>
<li>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice, as a result of feedback</li>
<li>reviewing how kindergartens’ annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association’s strategic priorities.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><p>There are no children with moderate to severe special needs currently enrolled in this service. Kindergarten teachers, have in the past, enrolled children with moderate to severe specific needs.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Teachers demonstrate empathy and inclusive care. Policies and procedures are in place to support the transition of children to kindergarten and provide support for attending school.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Raumati South Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-raumati-south-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Raumati South Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office’s latest report on Raumati South Kindergarten.</p><p>Raumati South Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>Raumati South Kindergarten is located on the Kapiti Coast, north of Wellington. Children, their families and teachers appreciate the purpose built facilities surrounded by extensive outdoor areas. This provides an exciting environment for learning. Dramatic and creative play areas encourage children to move freely, independently or with peers. Play resources are used flexibly to capture children’s interest and encourage problem solving and exploration.</p><p>The community and teachers are committed to providing children with authentic opportunities that promote sustainability, caring for animals and the environment. Teachers and children participate successfully in early childhood and the local school’s environmental initiatives. These accomplishments are integral to the learning programme. Displays of environmental events enable children and adults to revisit the learning from these experiences.</p><p>A positive, friendly tone is clearly evident throughout the kindergarten with children and teachers engaging in sustained conversations. Children persevere and enjoy activities with their peers for extended periods.</p><p>The kindergarten programme provides a wide range of learning opportunities for children to direct and maintain their own learning. Routines are appropriate for children’s care and well-being. Their choices in timing for eating, coming together and playing are respected and supported.</p><p>Teaching practices, such as understanding assessment and positive guidance programmes, encourage children to be capable and competent learners. Teachers are highly involved with children’s play. Their interactions with individuals and groups of children are a deliberate, measured approach where any intervention is carefully considered.</p><p>Families affirm the way teachers educate and care for children. They are welcomed and often participate with children at play. Teachers value the partnership they develop with parents, families and extended families.</p><p>Staff are committed to providing improved learning opportunities for children and their families. They have identified aspects of assessment and increasing teachers’ understanding of tikanga Māori are areas for development and review. ERO’s external evaluation findings concur with these directions. Increasing teachers understanding of the use of self review for ongoing improvement will assist them to evaluate the effectiveness of their practices.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Kathleen Atkins</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information About Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre’s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO’s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> – including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> – other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> – This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> – assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
