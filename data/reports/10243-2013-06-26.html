<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Just Kids Educare is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Just Kids Educare is situated in the suburb of Dannemora, in east Auckland. The centre caters for children from diverse cultural backgrounds. Three distinct learning areas are provided for infants, toddlers and older children.</p><p>This privately owned centre is one of several belonging to the same owners. The owners support their staff by providing internal and external professional development to improve teacher practice.</p><p>Teachers usually begin at this centre as trainees and stay on to become fulltime teachers. Some teachers have had a long association with the centre and have well established associations with many families.</p><p>The centre philosophy recognises the value of cultural diversity and expresses a commitment to bicultural practice. The service is described as one in which learning is fun. Staff have a clear focus on using children&rsquo;s individual skills and interests to promote their learning and development. The many good practices identified in ERO&rsquo;s 2010 review, in the programme for children and in centre management, continue to be evident.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Just Kidz Educare has a caring, warm tone. Teachers help children to become capable and confident learners and provide a programme that values children and respects their individuality. They engage children in positive conversations across all learning areas. They are responsive to children&rsquo;s learning interests and support them to sustain their play and exploration. Senior teachers are good professional models for other staff.</p><p>The centre is an inclusive environment that caters well for diversity. Good support is provided for children and parents who are learning English as an additional language. Learning programmes and practices are responsive to children&rsquo;s diverse cultural and socio-economic backgrounds.</p><p>The three learning areas are well designed to support children&rsquo;s learning. Children can move freely between learning areas to play with other children. Learning areas have sufficient resources to fully engage children in activities.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s daily programme is available for parents to view and wall displays provide good information about children&rsquo;s learning. Programme planning includes appropriate cultural activities.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s portfolios are on line for parents, who appreciate being able to access them when it suits so they can add their own comments to these records of their children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers could now consider ways to enable children to access these records more easily during the day.</p><p>The centre has two experienced teachers, who lead staff and manage the centre well. Although they are relatively new to management, they have established good routines and have created an inviting environment for children and families.</p><p>The centre owners have well established management processes. They continue to use self review to sustain, develop and improve centre operations and teaching practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>review and develop programme planning and assessment of children&rsquo;s learning to better reflect the learning progress of individual children</li>
<li>develop self review that is aligned to the centre&rsquo;s guiding documents</li>
<li>strengthen aspects of the teacher performance appraisal process.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Just Kidz Educare completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>26 June 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
