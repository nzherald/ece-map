</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Collectively Kids Ltd is licensed to provide education and care for 30 children, including 10 up to two years of age. The majority of children are NZ European/Pākehā. Eight Māori children and a small number from Samoan, Indian, Chinese, French, Russian and Irish backgrounds also attend. Teachers are ethnically diverse and are qualified and registered.</p><p>The service is well established. The owner provides a home-like service with well designed learning environments. Teachers maintain very positive relationships and there are high levels of communication between children, parents and centre staff. Interactions are consistent and focused on children's wellbeing and learning. The service has a strong focus on natural science, environmental responsibility and sustainable practices. Centre strategic plans show a focus on refining teaching and learning systems to increase the effectiveness of practice.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report noted the many positive practices that supported children’s all round development. These included high quality education and care practices, and skilful support to promote learning through play and to help children develop appropriate social relationships.</p><p>ERO also recommended staff improve planning documentation by strengthening links between centre documents and curriculum goals. It noted that self review could be further improved by more systematically collecting evaluated reflections and feedback to use in reviews. This report notes continued development in these areas, with teachers continuing to work collaboratively on developing planning, assessment and management documentation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are supported to become confident, articulate and socially adept. They are comfortable in their learning environment and are accepting of others. They enjoy a good sense of belonging and wellbeing and have strong relationships with caring teachers. Children’s positive attitudes to learning are evident. Older children display regard for the welfare of younger children. Children are self managing and take responsibility for the care of their learning environment. Teachers are aware of children’s individual rhythms for learning and work at the child’s pace.</p><p>Parents of children with diverse learning needs are enthusiastic about the inclusive and caring approach that teachers display when working with children. Families feel well supported.</p><p>The programme is stimulating and extends children’s learning. Opportunities are provided for mixed age play where older children support younger children. Children are actively supported by teachers to negotiate solutions to problems with their peers. Mathematics, literacy and science learning are evident in children’s individual portfolios. Children enjoy excursions into the local community where they learn about sustainable natural environments. Teachers and children explore topics and learn together.</p><p>The bicultural development of the centre has good foundations and continues to strengthen. Tikanga is being developed further and deeper connections are being established with the local Māori community. Children enjoy learning their mihi, engaging in powhiri, listening to traditional stories and singing waiata.</p><p>A broader understanding of the cultures of whānau continues to develop. Teachers survey parents to ask how they can further support children's home cultures. Staff come from a range of ethnic backgrounds and share aspects of their cultures in the programme. Parents also share their cultural knowledge and valued taonga/art pieces with the centre.</p><p>The centre owner is a leader in the centre. She is developing shared leadership roles amongst staff. Teachers have many opportunities to lead projects based on their interests and strengths. These reciprocal and respectful approaches underpin the positive relationships evident between staff.</p><p>Trusting relationships and learning partnerships have been established between parents and teachers. Partnerships have been developed particularly well with parents and whānau of children with special learning needs. Information is shared between the home, centre and support organisations. This means that children can receive high quality support. Parents appreciate the centre’s inclusive and welcoming environment where their children are valued and extended through learning experiences.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the owner/manager agree that teachers should continue to increase the extent to which there is a focus on individual children’s ongoing learning in their portfolios.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Collectively Kids Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>The owner and staff have recently shared and reviewed processes for maintaining the private and secure storage of children’s personal information.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Collectively Kids Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Dianne Moffitt</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>16 July 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
