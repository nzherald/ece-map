</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Colville Bay Early Learning Centre Inc is located in a small remote village on the edge of the Colville harbour in the Coromandel Peninsula. It is situated on the grounds of Colville school. Many families have generational relationships with the early learning centre and community. The centre operates as an incorporated society and a management team is elected each year. The centre is licensed to provide education and care for 26 children, including 6 children under 2 years of age. At the time of this ERO review there were 10 children on the roll.</p><p>Through whole staff professional learning and development, the centre has made good progress in addressing the area for development and review identified in the 2010 ERO report, which was related to extending children’s learning. Teachers have implemented effective self-review processes that have resulted in centre development and improvement. The centre is staffed by two registered teachers, an educator and a student teacher.</p><p>A significant factor is the close proximity of the centre to the school and there is a continual flow of children between the school and centre. Centre families and children are welcome at school events and often take trips together and socialise outside of centre hours. Most children will eventually transition to Colville school.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Management and teachers are providing effective centre governance. Teachers have established a welcoming, affectionate and inclusive atmosphere. The centre philosophy is clearly evident in the programme, environment and relationships. Teachers and families work in partnership and share decision making. Policies are regularly reviewed in consultation with families.</p><p>A useful framework for performance management is in place. ERO and teachers agree there would be benefit in seeking external feedback from respected practitioners. Compliance issues are well managed, and the centre is a safe and healthy place for children.</p><p>Centre leaders are focused on positive outcomes for families and children. There is:</p><ul>
<li>a collaborative approach amongst the teaching team to providing centre leadership</li>
<li>positive engagement in learning with families and whānau</li>
<li>professional development to strengthen teaching practice and increase teacher confidence in providing a high-quality service for the education and care of children.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are reflective practitioners and have established meaningful and manageable systems for self review, which ensure centre development and improvement. Teachers have identified and ERO agrees that opportunities could be given to involving families in providing programme experiences that help to meet parent aspirations for their children.</p><p>Teachers and families have designed a curriculum that responds to the context of Colville and the intent of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Children have many opportunities to develop and practice their early concepts of literacy and number. ERO observed children with high levels of social competency and self-management skills. Te Reo Māori is naturally interwoven throughout the programme. Children demonstrate confidence in sharing their knowledge of Māori language and spontaneously contribute when they hear it. They have ready access to the stories and traditions of their own cultures. Teachers are continuing to explore ways to capitalise on the cultural knowledge of teachers and families to enrich the programme.</p><p>Effective self review has led to a well-designed programme with a good balance of teacher-led and child-initiated play. Teachers have developed a clear and sequential process for documenting children’s learning and development. It is now time for teachers to give further consideration for actively involving children in this process.</p><p>Centre displays present children’s interests and learning for sharing with teachers and families. Children have many opportunities to lead their learning, make choices and persist in their play. They access the natural world and are able to visit the wider community and places of local interest. ERO and teachers agreed that they should continue to make use of the rich natural environment surrounding the centre.</p><p>The teaching team benefits from a good combination of the knowledge and experience, and the new knowledge that teachers in training bring. They are focused on building the social and emotional competence of children. Some skilful practices observed by ERO included:</p><ul>
<li>teachers engaging in active and dramatic play with children</li>
<li>respectful and nurturing relationships</li>
<li>teachers adding complexity to children’s learning in meaningful contexts</li>
<li>open questioning, playing with language and involving children in complex conversations.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are increasingly embedding te reo and aspects of tikanga Māori into their teaching practice. The inclusion of bicultural practices in strategic planning should further strengthen this development. Transitions from the centre are well planned and conducted at children’s own pace.</p><p>The centre maintains positive and reciprocal relationships with teachers at the school.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Colville Bay Early Learning Centre Inc completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Colville Bay Early Learning Centre Inc will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>23 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
