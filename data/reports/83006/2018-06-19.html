</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Islington Early Childhood Centre is a non-profit community-based centre in North East Valley, Dunedin. It provides education and care for two-to-five year old children.</p><p>A parent committee governs and manages the centre. Parents contribute daily to the sessions which run from 8:30am to 1:00pm, on a rostered and informal basis. Families have long-established relationships with the centre and its teachers.</p><p>The centre is led by a head teacher who works closely with another experienced teacher. A part-time teacher has joined the long-established teaching team. Teachers operate a programme for four year old children one afternoon per week. This programme focuses on developing children's social competency, leadership and self-management skills. It also provides opportunities for smaller group excursions beyond the centre.</p><p>Key aspects of the centre's philosophy include prioritising children's wellbeing, sense of belonging, building trusting relationships and for children to become confident and competent learners.</p><p>The centre has made good progress in many of the areas identified for development in ERO's 2015 report. These include building self-review practices, strengthening assessment, children's records of learning better reflecting their language, identity and culture, and the development of a more useful strategic plan.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from the positive, sensitive, and respectful relationships throughout the centre. Parents regularly and frequently stay at the centre to support their children's engagement in learning and that of other children. This is welcomed and encouraged by the teachers.</p><p>Teachers deliberately and naturally include fun and humour in their interactions with children. Children's language is built and extended through teachers' use of open-ended questions. Appropriate, carefully thought out support is provided for children with additional needs.</p><p>Teachers' and the centre's curriculum priorities include 'expanding children's horizons' and increasing their social competence. This is highly evident through the effective ways in which teachers promote and extend children's thinking and understanding. Strong features of the children's learning programme include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>comprehensive integration of early literacy learning, including story-telling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deliberate planning for and focus on aspects of early mathematics learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the way their interests and ideas are recognised and nurtured</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>creating connections between children's experiences and the natural world around them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ways in which parents and other family members contribute their expertise and passions to group learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Planning for individual children's learning is well-monitored by teachers, and communicated with parents and families. A next step for teachers is to ensure the strategies to support the intended learning are documented consistently and evaluated to show the effectiveness of these in supporting children's learning.</p><p>Children's learning is enhanced through capable, reflective leadership practices. Centre leadership is capable, collaborative and effectively supports high quality teaching practice. Leaders are making good use of professional learning and development. They show a strong commitment to internal evaluation and keeping up-to-date. Some very useful planned reviews have led to positive changes. Leaders deliberately foster and encourage strong, ongoing partnerships with families that best support the individual child.</p><p>The parent committee actively governs and supports centre operations and the teachers. It regularly consults with the wider parent group in a range of ways. Roles and responsibilities within the committee are well delegated and link appropriately with parents' interests, skills and experience. A schedule to review policies has been prioritised, however, some policies/procedures now need to align with current practices.</p><p>The committee has developed a more detailed annual section of the centre's strategic plan. It has also strengthened systems for financial management to support centre sustainability. It is now timely to consider more deliberate alignment between strategic goals (and progress towards these) and other key documents such as monthly teachers' reports, and appraisal.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the committee, leaders and teachers:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>when planning for children's learning, teachers should ensure the deliberate strategies to support the intended learning are well communicated and evaluated against</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to review policies and procedures for alignment between procedures and practices, in particular appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more closely align progress reporting to strategic goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders have identified, and ERO agrees, that developing specific guidelines to support the induction of new teachers will help ensure that the curriculum priorities and teaching practices desired at this centre are maintained.</p><p>The centre's philosophy for children could be streamlined. The parent committee has developed a philosophy and teachers have a philosophy for their beliefs about children's learning. While this philosophy is very evident in centre practices, it would be timely for the centre to agree on one philosophy that extends shared understandings and to review against.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Islington Early Childhood Centre Inc completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Islington Early Childhood Centre Inc will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>19 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
