</table><p>Templeton Nursery and Preschool is in the early stages of developing an effective management framework. The managers and teachers have participated in extensive professional development provided by the Ministry of Education. They have yet to fully use the knowledge that they have gained to put in place systems and practices to promote ongoing improvement for high quality learning and teaching for all children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Templeton Nursery and Preschool provides for babies, infants and children to school age. All teachers are registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>The centre was being extensively renovated at the time of the ERO review. New play spaces were being built for nursery and preschool-age children. Facilities for staff and children were being improved. The outdoor areas were being redesigned to provide infants and toddlers with direct access from the indoor play room to their outdoor area. The centre was operating under a transitional licence.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review, a new centre manager has been appointed and a curriculum leader position established. The centre has made good progress in improving the quality and usefulness of their child assessment practices. Self review and staff appraisal remain areas for further development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of two centres, owned and administered by the same service provider. The other centre is Estuary Road Preschool and Nursery.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and happy in the centre environment. They have positive relationships with their teachers and each other. Teachers skilfully give children and families the time they need to settle into the programme and to share information. Staff share this information and work collaboratively to ensure the best outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers make good use of their knowledge of each child to involve them in meaningful conversations, to extend their learning and to support their emotional wellbeing.</p><p>Infants and toddlers in the nursery form close relationships with their teachers who take time to listen, and are flexible in their approaches, to meet the interests and needs of the children.</p><p>Managers have high expectations for child assessment and planning. These expectations are well documented and regularly monitored. Teachers consistently identify children’s interests, show children’s progress and revisit learning.</p><p>Children’s transitions into, within the centre and to school are well planned to support the needs of each child and their family.</p><p>The managers have recently improved centre operations by aligning the centre policies and procedures to the 2008 Early Childhood Regulations. This is ensuring that health and safety requirements are well met.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers and ERO give high priority to completing the management framework that was begun with advisory support assistance. Completion and implementation of the framework should ensure the centre is sustainable and the quality of learning and teaching continues to improve. The managers need to complete:</p><ul>
<li>the philosophy and put it into practice</li>
<li>the strategic plan and monitor progress towards achieving the goals</li>
<li>the new staff appraisal process and to ensure that it meets the practicing teacher criteria.</li>
</ul><p>The managers and teachers should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>embed self-review practices</li>
<li>refine programme planning and evaluation</li>
<li>further develop Māori success as Māori, and the inclusion of te reo and tikanga Māori in the programme.</li>
</ul><p>The managers should also consider ways that the two centres can work more closely together to share good practices and support each other.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Templeton Nursery and Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to governance and management. To meet requirements, the service needs to ensure appropriate documents are developed, maintained and regularly reviewed.<em>[47(1) (c) (i) Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008]</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Templeton Nursery and Preschool will be within two years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>15 September 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
