<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1. Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The service is developing its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Elim International Kids is situated in the heart of inner city Wellington. The centre caters for 30 children of diverse ethnicities.</p><p>The centre is governed by a strategic management team and is part of the ministry of the Elim&nbsp;Church. The centre director is responsible for day-to-day operations. There have been some changes to staffing since the ERO review in 2009. This includes changes to the leadership structure.</p><p>The centre philosophy reflects its value on partnerships with families. Christian and Bible-based beliefs are a focus within the programme. The intent is to provide children with opportunities to grow their individual strengths, interests and ideas.</p><p>Since the previous review, there have been developments to support the centre&rsquo;s operation. Managers resource and assist teachers to be involved in professional development.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Relationships and interactions between children and teachers are warm and positive. The service is welcoming to families and a sense of belonging is fostered. Children enjoy the company of others and many play in small friendship groups.</p><p>Teachers have some useful strategies to support children and their families for whom English is a second language. Information is shared with parents in regular and helpful ways, including making use of information and communication technologies to share centre events and aspects of children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Children are responsive to familiar and predictable routines. Resourcing is readily accessible and purposeful. Children have some opportunities to be involved in sustained play. Wall displays are attractive and reflect the cultural backgrounds of children, their families and wh&#257;nau. Teachers make good use of the local area to provide a wide range of learning experiences.</p><p>A newly implemented process has the potential to better support teachers in planning an appropriate programme for children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>ERO has identified and teachers agree that the next steps to improve outcomes for children are for staff to:</p><ul>
<li>increase understanding and use of self-review and evaluation including making better use of current thinking and approaches in early childhood education</li>
<li>further develop assessment and planning processes to more clearly identify the teachers' role, and the links to children&rsquo;s assessment for learning</li>
<li>maximise opportunities to extend children&rsquo;s thinking, problem solving and creativity</li>
<li>ensure that more significance is given to te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori in the curriculum</li>
<li>extend the appraisal process to include stronger use of evidence.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Elim International Kids Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>4 March 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p><h3>Disclaimer</h3><p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p></html>
