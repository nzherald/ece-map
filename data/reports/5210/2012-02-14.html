<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p align="left">Gwen Rogers Free Kindergarten operates under the auspices of the Tauranga Kindergarten Association. The kindergarten is located at Omanu, adjacent to the primary school, and provides all-day and sessional education and care for children from three years to school age.</p>
<p align="left">The longstanding head teacher has instigated considerable development throughout 2011 to the building and grounds. Property upgrades have enhanced the indoor environment, and the river/water feature has created a natural environment that is inviting for children and which provides a context for much valuable learning and teaching.</p>
<p align="left">The head teacher continues to provide well-informed educational leadership for staff and parents. Under her strategic leadership, a new team of teachers has reviewed the kindergarten&rsquo;s programme philosophy, and areas for development in the previous ERO review have been addressed. A strong M&#257;ori dimension is evident in the environment and programme, and children are developing an awareness and understanding of New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage. Children are involved in the assessment of their learning through individual portfolios, which are a central focus for discussion about learning for parents, teachers and children.</p>
<p align="left">The kindergarten continues to enjoy a high level of support from its parent and wider communities. Parents are surveyed for their views and aspirations as part of the review process, and their ideas contribute to annual and strategic planning. The parent committee has an ongoing role in the management of the kindergarten, and supports staff in the organisation of many activities and fundraising ventures, the most recent of which provided valuable additional funds for playground development.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p align="left">Before the review, the management of Gwen Rogers Free Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atGwen Rogers Free Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p align="left">Teachers, in consultation with parents, have reviewed the kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy for learning which focuses on building strong relationships and a sense of belonging for children and their families.</p>
<p align="left">The service aims to provide an emergent programme that is responsive to children&rsquo;s interest and ideas, and enables them to develop their social competencies in a supportive and caring environment.</p>
<p align="left">Sustainability is an underlying concept whereby children are encouraged to develop an early awareness of, and responsibility for, the environment.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p align="left"><b>Environment for learning:</b> The kindergarten provides a high-quality environment that is inviting and stimulating for children. Teachers have developed a wide range of learning areas that are intentionally designed to capture children&rsquo;s natural curiosity and enrich learning and play. Both indoor and outdoor areas are richly resourced with features of the natural world being well integrated. Children interact confidently with the environment.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Leadership:</b> The experienced and well-informed head teacher continues to focus on improving outcomes for children. She models inclusive practice and establishes positive relationships within the kindergarten community. Under her leadership, the kindergarten continues to be well supported and have a high profile in the community. The head teacher works closely with the parent committee and consults regularly with them about the kindergarten&rsquo;s strategic direction.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Programme:</b> There is an appropriate balance between teacher-led and child- initiated play. Children are encouraged and supported to make choices and decisions about their play, and in the morning session especially, children play cooperatively with one another. Early literacy, mathematical and science concepts are skilfully integrated into the programme. A rich array of learning experiences promotes the kindergarten&rsquo;s holistic approach and enables children to develop interests across all learning areas. Children are able to be challenged, have fun, and enjoy satisfying and worthwhile learning experiences.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Relationships:</b> Relationships among teachers, children and their families are respectful and caring. Teachers warmly welcome children and their families into the kindergarten and involve them in the children&rsquo;s education. They know children and their families well and a strong sense of ownership and belonging is evident.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Interactions:</b> Teachers effectively model oral language and provide many opportunities for children to use language in meaningful contexts. In the afternoon session especially, teachers take time to assist children to form friendships and develop social competencies. They listen carefully to children, and extend their ideas through conversation and skilful questioning. Te reo M&#257;ori is increasingly permeating the programme through teachers&rsquo; spontaneous use of prompts and vocabulary. ERO observed confident and articulate children.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Assessment, planning and evaluation:</b> A high priority is placed on teachers noticing, recognising and responding to children&rsquo;s learning in play<b>.</b> Teachers&rsquo; observations are recorded in narrative statements to the child and parent. Feedback from parents is sought and children&rsquo;s individual goals set. Children have easy access to their portfolios and are encouraged to contribute their work. The teaching team has worked collaboratively to increase the level of children&rsquo;s participation in assessment, and the head teacher and senior teacher recognise the need to strengthen the process for programme evaluation.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Self review:</b> There is both planned and spontaneous self review of systems and practices in the kindergarten. Wide consultation is undertaken and evidence is well documented. Outcomes of self review are used to bring about improvements, an example being the transition-to-school programme. Reflective practice is a feature of teacher meetings and evaluations.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p align="left">The newly formed teaching team has undertaken a review of the kindergarten philosophy, and is establishing collegial working relationships and shared understandings of agreed practice. In addition, a new approach to appraisal is being trialled. The head teacher recognises, and ERO agrees, that in order to embed this philosophy and enhance teacher capability, areas for ongoing development are:</p>
<ul>
<li>observation of, and feedback about, professional practice to enhance teacher capability;</li>
<li>capturing continuity of learning though play in learning stories;</li>
<li>regularising reflective practice and collegial sharing as part of evaluation and self review; and</li>
<li>building children&rsquo;s voice in learning and assessment.</li>
</ul>
<a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3>
<p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs;</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners; and</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Although there are no children with moderate to severe special needs currently enrolled, the inclusive and cooperative culture that is evident indicates that Gwen Rogers Free Kindergarten is well placed to cater for children with special needs.</p>
<a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Gwen Rogers Free Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>

<p>To the Parents and Community of Gwen Rogers Free Kindergarten</p>
<p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Gwen Rogers Free Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">Gwen Rogers Free Kindergarten operates under the auspices of the Tauranga Kindergarten Association. The kindergarten is located at Omanu, adjacent to the primary school, and provides all-day and sessional education and care for children from three years to school age.</p>
<p align="left">The longstanding head teacher has instigated considerable development throughout 2011 to the building and grounds. Property upgrades have enhanced the indoor environment, and the river/water feature has created a natural environment that is inviting for children and which provides a context for much valuable learning and teaching.</p>
<p align="left">The head teacher continues to provide well-informed educational leadership for staff and parents. Under her strategic leadership, a new team of teachers has reviewed the kindergarten&rsquo;s programme philosophy, and areas for development in the previous ERO review have been addressed. A strong M&#257;ori dimension is evident in the environment and programme, and children are developing an awareness and understanding of New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage. Children are involved in the assessment of their learning through individual portfolios, which are a central focus for discussion about learning for parents, teachers and children.</p>
<p align="left">The kindergarten continues to enjoy a high level of support from its parent and wider communities. Parents are surveyed for their views and aspirations as part of the review process, and their ideas contribute to annual and strategic planning. The parent committee has an ongoing role in the management of the kindergarten, and supports staff in the organisation of many activities and fundraising ventures, the most recent of which provided valuable additional funds for playground development.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p>
<p align="left"><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
