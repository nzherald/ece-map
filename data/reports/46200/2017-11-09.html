</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids Barn Childcare Centre is a privately owned early childhood centre in Hawera. It is licensed for 62 children, including 12 children up to 2 years of age.</p><p>Since the February 2015 ERO review, the centre has been relicensed as a result of a change in ownership. The majority of the teaching team are new. The quality of education is overseen by the manager, who is supported by two head teachers. The centre has made significant progress towards addressing the key next steps identified in the previous ERO report.</p><p>There are two main learning areas, one for children over two years of age and the other for the service's youngest children. Each of these areas has its own team of teachers.</p><p>The centre philosophy makes a commitment to providing high quality education and care for each child, underpinned by positive relationships with whānau and community, holistic teaching and learning, and real life with nature.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn in a welcoming and inviting environment that strongly reflects the centre philosophy, and where the expressed values are highly evident in practice. Leaders have identified it is timely to review the centre philosophy as a new team, to further strengthen a shared understanding of what it looks like when enacted effectively in teaching practice.</p><p>The service values the importance of children learning through play. Children's sense of belonging is evident. Positive child-teacher-family relationships successfully support the development of children's identity.</p><p>Respectful teaching and learning practices promote high quality learning outcomes for children. Teachers view children as competent and provide effective support for them to lead their own learning. The wide range of activities and resources promotes and extends their ideas and interests. They are able to challenge themselves and problem solve.</p><p>Teachers use effective strategies to encourage children’s language development, mathematical understanding and sustained engagement in learning. They are included in children's play and take a considered approach to supporting and extending children's ideas and understanding.</p><p>Programme provision for infants and toddlers is appropriately focused on nurturing their wellbeing. Children's care routines are unhurried and enjoyable learning experiences. Their rhythms and routines guide the programme. Authentic opportunities for active communication and exploration support children to develop independence and self-management skills.</p><p>The stimulating and inviting outdoor environment reflects the rural community, the bicultural identity of New Zealand, and the natural world. Children can readily access the orchard and gardens as part of the programme, which supports the centre's sustainability focus. Food is provided for children, to better support healthy eating. Their ownership of the environment and sense of wellbeing are strongly evident.</p><p>Positive relationships between educators and children are evident. Regular, useful information is provided for parents about their child’s day, through daily diaries and individual child profiles. These form an attractive record of children's development and engagement in learning and are accessible to children and their families.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have recently refined the process for documenting children's assessment. Further strengthening the use of assessment to evaluate the impact of teaching and learning is a next step.</p><p>The centre is strengthening provision for Māori children and their whānau through community links and place-based learning. Meaningful experiences celebrate Māori children's language, culture and identity. ERO's evaluation affirms leaders and teachers actions to further enhance their knowledge of what success as Māori looks like for Māori learners and their whānau.</p><p>Teachers are developing culturally responsive practices to support Pacific children's cultures. They actively respond to parent aspirations. Continuing to strengthen the ways they assess and document success for Pacific learners is a next step.</p><p>Children's transitions into and within the centre are well supported by key teachers. Positive relations between centre staff and local schools assists older children’s seamless transition. A recent centre review of transition processes contributes to a well-considered flexible approach to meet individual children’s needs.</p><p>Careful consideration is given to provision for children who require additional learning and their families. Teachers appropriately plan and implement successful strategies to cater for children's individual needs. Staff work in collaboration with parents and whānau and seek advice and guidance from appropriate agencies when necessary.</p><p>A robust appraisal process supports teachers to think about how well they are teaching and making changes to their practice. They share their knowledge and professional learning with each other. External professional support is based on individual and team needs and used to improve teaching.</p><p>A collaborative leadership culture encourages opportunities for teachers to take on leadership roles. Teachers are valued and acknowledged for the strengths, skills and expertise they bring to the centre. They regularly seek professional learning and development and access research to support their practice.</p><p>The centre’s strategic plan has a clear focus on outcomes for children and their families. Ongoing review is used successfully to identify how well these are achieved. A comprehensive strategic plan meaningfully guides operations and has a strong accountability focus on improving outcomes for all children.</p><p>There is a useful internal evaluation framework to guide and inform ongoing improvement practices. Leaders recognise that continuing to deepen their understanding of what constitutes a high quality evaluation process is a next step.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, centre leaders and teachers agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review the centre philosophy as a new teaching team</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen the use of children's assessment in evaluation and documentation of success for Pacific learners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further strengthen internal evaluation to better evaluate learning outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids Barn Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids Barn Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>9 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
