</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Arataki Kindergarten provides both sessional and school-day early childhood education and care for children from two years to school age. At the time of this review 49 children were enrolled, including 12 of Māori descent.</p><p>The kindergarten’s philosophy aims to inspire respectful, responsive and inquisitive learners in partnership with children, families, the environment and surrounding communities.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of Tauranga Region Kindergartens (TRK), which is a not-for-profit early childhood education service, governed by a board of parent-elected community representatives. Senior teachers oversee and support the professional work of the kindergarten. This work is supplemented by a resource teacher Māori who provides professional learning and support for TRK staff in te ao Māori.</p><p>The association sets the strategic direction of its kindergartens with emphasis on nurturing reciprocal relationships with whānau and communities, organisational sustainability, meeting community needs, and honouring the Treaty of Waitangi. The TRK provides kindergarten staff with clear guidelines and expectations for practice. There are systematic processes and highly effective self-review practices to monitor and evaluate the quality of teaching, education and care provided by this kindergarten.</p><p>Consistent with TRK policy of only employing trained and registered teachers in regulated positions, the kindergarten is staffed by four qualified and registered teachers, along with an administrator.</p><p>There is a well-established teaching team. The long-standing head teacher has been granted a year’s leave from the kindergarten. In her absence one of the teaching team will be the acting head teacher.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews in the Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The value of whākawhānaungatanga (relationships) is at the centre of this community of learners, where everyone works collaboratively to achieve shared aspirations for tamariki. Teachers value what children, parents and whānau contribute to learning and the life of the kindergarten. They demonstrate a genuine belief in parents and whānau as the first and foremost educators of their tamariki. These responsive and reciprocal relationships, and high levels of engagement contribute to the warm and welcoming culture, and holistic wellbeing of tamariki, parents, whānau and teachers.</p><p>An experienced and well-informed head teacher provides highly effective professional kindergarten leadership. Her high expectations for teaching and learning are supported by regular and in-depth reflections and professional discussions about teachers’ practice and outcomes for tamariki. There are meaningful opportunities for shared leadership where each teacher makes a significant contribution to growing team capability, knowledge and enhanced outcomes for tamariki and whānau.</p><p>The teaching team, parents and whānau have a shared and clearly articulated philosophy that underpins the curriculum and teachers’ practice. Parents who spoke to ERO confidently talked about the philosophy and how it influences teachers’ responses, the environment, learning opportunities and outcomes for their tamariki as learners. A well-considered assessment framework is used effectively to engage parents and tamariki in learning, inform teachers’ practice and planning, and to review children’s learning and curriculum effectiveness.</p><p>Nga pūrakau (legends and stories) provide a te ao Māori framework for the curriculum, assessment and teachers’ practice. Local stories and attributes (learning powers) of the characters are used as a vehicle to support children’s sense of belonging and relationship to Papatuanuku (the land). This story telling approach assists children to develop their learning powers and understand what helps them to learn.</p><p>The head teacher’s commitment to promoting te reo Māori and bicultural practices is highly evident in spontaneous korero Māori by tamariki and whānau. Tamariki Māori are confident and enjoy opportunities to contribute and participate as tāngata whenua.</p><p>Children benefit from active exploration in a thoughtfully planned and resourced learning environment, and intentional teaching responses based on knowledge of children. Features of the environment and teachers’ responses include:</p><ul>
<li>the emphasis on fostering children’s oral language and confidence to express their ideas, feelings and desires</li>
<li>empowerment of children to set challenges, problem solve, manipulate resources, and lead their own learning</li>
<li>positive relationships and interactions between children, opportunities to be leaders, share their skills and knowledge, and develop social and emotional learning powers</li>
<li>kaitiakitanga (guardians), where children are encouraged to care for the environment, themselves and others in the kindergarten and the local community</li>
<li>teachers’ deep knowledge of individuals which enables children’s interests, strengths and preferences to guide the daily programme.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers maximise opportunities for children to learn about, and celebrate difference and diversity. They actively promote equitable opportunities for all learners and hold the belief that every child can, and has the right to learn. They trust children as capable and confident learners and decision makers, and support them to succeed.</p><p>Highly effective systems, including planned and responsive self review, supports and informs learning for adults and tamariki. There is close alignment between the philosophy, teacher appraisal, strategic plan, assessment practice and self review that contributes to sustainable practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>An important consideration for this kindergarten is to sustain effective practices and for teachers to continue to consolidate and embed:</p><ul>
<li>self review and appraisal practices</li>
<li>the assessment framework</li>
<li>a model of shared leadership.</li>
</ul><p>In addition there is a need to provide support, coaching and mentoring for the acting head teacher to maximise her learning from this leadership opportunity.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Arataki Free Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Arataki Free Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>27 October 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
