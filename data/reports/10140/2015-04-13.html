</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Amanda’s Homebased ECE is a well-established service with educators located across Auckland. The service includes three networks, each with different characteristics. This report focuses on a network that features a Ministry of Education (MoE) Participation Project aimed at providing education and care for children from diverse cultures. A community of Somali, Afghani and Ethiopian families uses this network. There are currently 59 children enrolled, including nine under two years of age.</p><p>The service has three Educational Team Leaders (ETLs) who are registered teachers. They provide support and guidance for educators across the three networks. The owners have responsibility for the management of the service.</p><p>Since the 2008 ERO review Amanda’s Homebased ECE has undergone significant change. Its administration has relocated from central to west Auckland, two of the ETLs are new appointments and there have been changes in MoE funding. The service was relicensed in 2013 and has needed to meet new licensing requirements and expectations.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service has been proactive in providing education and care that meets the needs of its migrant community. It has supported the families in terms of employment, financial security, socialisation and education for both children and adults. The ETLs have been sensitive in introducing <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and in developing their expectations for formal learning records.</p><p>Educators provide a range of experiences for children in homes and in the community, including playgroup and group excursions. While ETLs continue to support educators to develop their play resources, children enthusiastically explore many activities at a weekly playgroup. They enjoy creative and manipulative materials as they build relationships with others and participate in physical activity and musical experiences. ETLs actively encourage children and educators to use their home languages as well as English.</p><p>Children are well supported to settle into educators' homes and to transition to school. ETLs monitor how well infants and toddlers adapt and help educators to establish daily diaries that record children’s routines and play interests. ETLs write affirming reports about children’s holistic development that provide very good information to support their entry into school.</p><p>Training opportunities have had a positive impact on educators’ practice. They are developing skills to set up learning environments and use equipment to engage children in play. Educators support children’s behaviour in positive ways. ETLs model effective teaching strategies at playgroup and encourage skills for positive social interaction. The playgroups also enable ETLs to establish very good relationships with educators and families in these diverse communities.</p><p>The owners and ETLs are a collegial team committed to ongoing improvement in the service. ETLs make regular home visits to the educators and have recently improved the quality of their monthly reports about children as a result of reflective self review.</p><p>A new appraisal system for ETLs has been implemented. The owners agree this process could be developed further to ensure ETLs set measurable goals and regularly evaluate their own progress. ETLs also want to strengthen their bicultural practices.</p><p>The owners share management responsibilities with the ETLs. They engage in ongoing discussions about priorities for the service and their vision to include new opportunities for diverse communities. This informal approach does not always support a clear direction for the service. The owners and ETLs recognise that they should now redefine the leadership structure and better document expectations. This would help them to sustain the service’s operations more effectively over time.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service owners and ETLs agree that key next steps for improving the service include:</p><ul>
<li>increasing the support for culturally diverse educators to understand the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand</li>
<li>improving documented systems to better support ETL practice in relation to their coaching roles, playgroup planning, parent contact and educator visit records</li>
<li>updating the strategic plan to reflect current priorities, set long-term direction and make provision for the regular evaluation of strategic goals</li>
<li>developing systems and a framework for the team to undertake planned, strategic self review.</li>
</ul><p>The owners and ETLs recognise they should urgently implement documented systems for the effective monitoring of health and safety regulatory requirements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Amanda's Homebased ECE 2 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practices the service should:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen its risk management processes for excursions</li>
<li>ensure that all teacher registrations and police vets are renewed in a timely manner</li>
<li>adjust privacy practices to reflect changes in staffing, assessment tools and documentation</li>
<li>urgently implement documented systems for the effective monitoring of health and safety regulatory requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Amanda's Homebased ECE 2 will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>13 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
