</table><p>With targeted association support, Petone Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Petone Kindergarten is a well-established centre situated near Petone township. Since the January 2012 ERO report, hours of operation have changed and six-hour sessions now operate for children from two years to school age.</p><p>Petone Kindergarten is one of 85 kindergartens and three home-based education and care networks governed and managed by He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). This is a new kindergarten association created from joining the Rimutaka and Wellington Kindergarten Associations in 2014. The transition to the new association is expected to be a three-year process.</p><p>The board and managers provide governance for the organisation. Senior teachers have delegated kindergartens. Their role is to provide regular support and a range of professional learning and development opportunities for teachers.</p><p>All teachers are qualified and registered at Petone Kindergarten. Some, including the head teacher have many years experience at the kindergarten. The centre philosophy focuses on providing a welcoming environment for all, which embraces children’s mana and holistic learning.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report for Petone Kindergarten identified at centre level that assessment, planning, self review, appraisal and use of te reo Māori needed further development. Areas where the Wellington Kindergarten Association needed to strengthen its support for teachers were also identified at the time. Improvement continues to be needed in some of these areas that the association has plans to address. These feature as key next steps in this report. The alignment of individual kindergarten’s annual plans with the association’s strategic priorities has now been addressed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 12 kindergarten reviews in He Whānau Manaaki Kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>In 2012, the association developed a framework to guide the implementation of its curriculum, Te Manawa. This document outlines criteria for curriculum delivery including expectations for assessment and planning for children’s learning. Petone Kindergarten’s curriculum, what children experience, requires further development to meet the association's expectations for high quality learning.</p><p>Assessment portfolios provide a record of children’s participation and involvement in kindergarten experiences and activities. Teachers need to improve these records to more clearly and consistently, identify and respond to children's learning, and their next learning steps. Recent developments to group planning processes include making children’s learning more visible for parents and whānau.</p><p>Teachers are at the early stages of inquiring into aspects of their practice. These review processes require further development. Next steps in self review and evaluation to guide decisions for improvement to teaching and learning are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the use of evidenced based indicators of effective practice</li>
<li>gather more evidence and deepen the analysis of this information</li>
<li>have more in-depth evaluation of outcomes of children's learning.</li>
</ul><p>The senior teacher provides termly written reports that outline agreed development priorities and progress in relation to the quality of teaching and learning. The association has recently implemented new reports that should more deliberately focus on outcomes for children, and teacher and leader performance. ERO's evaluation affirms this development. Targeted support is needed to improve curriculum leadership and to more effectively respond to all learners.</p><p>Children have relationships that are caring and responsive. Teachers are welcoming to parents and families. Children have some opportunities to make choices in the programme and sustain their play. Older children are encouraged to support younger children in their play. Teachers purposefully support children’s social learning.</p><p>Teachers have established some good links with local schools that helps positive transitions for children and their families. They are exploring further ways to enhance this process.</p><p>Children with additional needs are positively supported. Teachers are aware practices that are inclusive and involve families in decisions that affect their children while at the kindergarten.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report identified that the association needed to improve the appraisal processes. This continues to require development. A recently revised appraisal model, yet to be implemented, includes: more focused goals that build teacher and leader capability; more regular and targeted feedback and feed forward about teaching practice; and clearer links with the Registered Teacher Criteria.</p><p>Children have some opportunities to learn about Aotearoa New Zealand’s dual cultural heritage. Teachers and leaders acknowledge that they need to build their capability to be responsive to Māori children’s culture, language and identity. This development should include establishing relationships with mana whenua and making use of Ministry of Education resources such as,<em>Ka Hikitia- Accelerating Success</em> 2013 - 2017 and <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners.</em></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher, head teacher, staff, and ERO agree on the following key next steps. They will:</p><ul>
<li>develop understanding of self review</li>
<li>improve assessment and programme planning</li>
<li>promote ways for Māori to achieve success as Māori, and Pacific learners to achieve success as Pacific</li>
<li>build curriculum leadership capability.</li>
</ul><p>The senior management team of He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua should continue to further improve processes for growing and developing the practice of teachers, head teachers and the senior teacher. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>improvements to the quality and monitoring of processes to support individual kindergartens and regular implementation of a robust appraisal system.</li>
</ul><p>Progress against an action plan, that addresses the key next steps and actions for compliance, will be monitored by ERO.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Petone Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management and the provision of a suitable early childhood education for children. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas and ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>the service is effectively governed and managed in accordance with good management practices, including review practices<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6]</em></li>
<li>the practices of adults providing education and care demonstrate an understanding of children’s development and knowledge of relevant theories and practice in early childhood education.<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Service 2008,</em> C4]</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Petone Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>8 June 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p><p>right"&gt;The Child – the Heart of the Matter</p>
