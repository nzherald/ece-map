</table><p>ACE Nayland is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ACE Nayland in Nelson is one of two early learning services governed and managed by Ahorangi Ltd. The centre is licensed to provide full day care and education for children over two to school age. The license was extended in 2016 to a maximum of 60 children.</p><p>The centre philosophy values a whānau approach to care and belonging. It states that children will be encouraged to inquire and be creative in a number of ways, for example in drama, art and music. Teachers are encouraged to consider the unique stage and age of individual children.</p><p>ACE Nayland offers the opportunity for children to work in small, similar-aged groups with an allocated teacher. These groupings are flexible and very responsive to the children's needs and interests.</p><p>The centre is governed by the owners who have specialised skills and expertise in early childhood education and the developmental needs of children.</p><p>A recently-appointed centre manager works with team leaders to manage day-to-day operations. The owners often work closely alongside this team. Most staff are qualified and certified early childhood teachers, with additional staff currently undergoing training. There has been significant restructuring of leadership and staffing changes in the centre over the past three years.</p><p>Since the last ERO review, the centre has made good progress in addressing assessment for learning practices, and building learning partnerships with children, parents and whānau.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of two early childhood and care centre reviews in the Ahorangi Ltd organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have the opportunity to learn in a welcoming, well-resourced environment that provides multiple opportunities for learning and investigation. They can easily access resources and are encouraged to be creative and extend their play ideas.</p><p>Teachers are deliberate in how they plan to support individual children's learning. They notice what children are interested in and their attitudes to learning. Teachers are intentional in their use of resources in alignment with the centre philosophy that promotes the exploration of day-to-day materials as tools for learning. There is a focus on creativity and challenge.</p><p>Children experience thoughtful and fluid groupings that include attention to age, cultural and learning needs. Learning is based on individual interests and needs. Literacy and mathematical resources and associated language are well integrated into everyday activities. Bicultural practices are regularly part of children's daily routines. Inclusive practices are well incorporated by teachers, with children and whānau needs being well supported, especially children with additional needs. Where appropriate, external agency support is sought and used.</p><p>Leaders and teachers actively seek to understand and respond to whānau aspirations, and support parents to take a meaningful role in their child's learning. This includes the involvement of parents in goal setting and evaluating learning outcomes for their children. Aspirations from parents are gathered in a number of ways and are valued and used.</p><p>Transitions are well planned into, within and out of the centre. They are individualised to the child and are flexible, thoughtful and carefully managed. Leaders have focused on building good relationships with local schools to support children.</p><p>Leaders have ensured that teachers have time allocated for regular professional development which is focused on centre and individual teacher priorities. There is a commitment to the understanding and implementation of Te Whāriki 2017. Teachers are well supported by a strong appraisal process that includes self reflection, mentoring and constructive feedback from leaders.</p><p>There is a strong commitment by the owners and leaders to equity and ethical practices for children and whānau. Thoughtful consideration is given to staff ratios. Care is subsidised by the owners in some instances, and practical parent/whānau support is provided by leaders and teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre owners have identified the need to build relationships and cohesiveness in the new leadership team. ERO has identified some aspects of leadership that should contribute to the effectiveness of the new leadership team. These are to:</p><ul>
<li>provide targeted professional learning for new leaders</li>
<li>develop a shared understanding of role expectations for leaders</li>
<li>develop quality action planning to prioritise tasks for leadership that includes identifying specific outcomes, and providing clear timeframes and responsibilities.</li>
</ul><p>Internal evaluation requires strengthening. Leaders, in particular, need to develop their knowledge of targeted internal evaluation for growth and manage change effectively. Teachers need to be supported by leadership to grow their understandings of evaluative practice.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ACE Nayland completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ACE Nayland will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</p><p>29 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
