</table><p>With a new teaching team and many new developments within Barnardos, at both national and local level, further work needs to be done to embed new initiatives, build capability and ensure the sustainability of practice and operation.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Barnardos KidStart Childcare Manawatu East Home-Based Service is one of two networks owned and administered by Barnardos covering Manawatu, Whanganui and Horowhenua. At the time of the October 2012 ERO report, this service was known as KidStart Home-Based Care and Learning East Project. Since then, Barnardos New Zealand has undergone a significant restructure, changing from a regional to a nationally-based organisation. This network was renamed following the September 2014 decision to combine the Palmerston North West, East and Levin networks.</p><p>The restructure of Barnardos included the appointment of new personnel and the creation of new roles and responsibilities at governance and management level. In this network, an acting team leader oversees the work of two newly-appointed visiting teachers. Their role is to support educators to implement suitable early learning programmes for children in their homes.</p><p>The network caters for up to 80 children aged up to six years. Of those enrolled, 12 identify as Māori.</p><p>The philosophy underpinning practice is currently under review. In the past, relationships and whakawhanaungatanga were identified as key drivers of the children’s programme.</p><p>The December 2012 ERO review of this network identified concerns about the quality of children’s learning programmes, support for teachers, and consideration of te ao Māori in practice and operation. Since then, integrating the revised governance structure and new roles, responsibilities and personnel has been a focus for development throughout the organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Recent changes have the potential to provide enhanced and consistent support for teaching and learning. Educators report the revised teacher responsibilities are enabling visiting teachers to provide more focused support for them to implement appropriate learning programmes for children.</p><p>Children’s puka puka (records of learning) show that learning programmes in homes are suitably child led and based around their interests, everyday happenings and the local community. Links to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, are identified. Most educators celebrate and record special happenings, children’s ideas and care routines. Regular teacher visits occur where information about children’s development is shared. Barnardos continues to work on strengthening relationships with parents and encouraging their input into learning programmes. Formally requesting information from parents and whānau about the aspirations they have for their children’s care and learning has been a recent and positive development.</p><p>Barnardos playgroups and excursions provide good opportunities for children to socialise, educators to network and visiting teachers to model expected practice. A revised approach to planning sessions and improved playgroup experiences are supporting a clearer focus on children’s learning. Since the 2012 ERO review, more appropriate settings for playgroups have been sourced.</p><p>Visiting teachers' notes and children’s puka puka show that in the past educators have not been adequately supported over time to recognise and respond to children’s learning. Managers and visiting teachers are working well to identify and address issues. Professional development has been provided. New training modules are about to be introduced. Some review has been undertaken, providing specific and useful data about priority development areas. More recent visiting teacher notes and puka puka records provide a wider range of useful information to support educators. Good quality models of assessment are presented. Strategies to extend children’s ideas and strengthen their learning dispositions are suggested. ERO and management agree that evaluation of the quality and effectiveness of curriculum should be ongoing and requires further development.</p><p>Barnardos focus on developing understanding of biculturalism is becoming evident at all levels and across the operation of the organisation. Through new initiatives such as Ngā Pou e Whā and Huarahi Atawhai, managers, teachers and educators are being actively supported to develop their understanding of appropriate ways to work with Māori. Self-identified next development steps are to embed bicultural understanding and investigate the appropriateness of Barnardos cultural practices in supporting success for Māori children as Māori.</p><p>There is a strong expectation that visiting teachers and educators provide an inclusive environment that allows for the participation of all children. Managers have a good knowledge of relevant agencies for supporting children with specials needs. Individual education plans are created for these children.</p><p>Procedures to support children’s transitions into and out of the network continue to be developed. Children’s placement in homes is carefully considered. A nationally-led strategy to strengthen the quality and consistency of the transition-to-school process is being considered.</p><p>The revised management and leadership structure is a positive development for this network. It is supporting a stronger focus on teaching and learning. Finalising the position of the network within the local Barnardos homebased education and care services teams, and appointing a permanent leader are vital next steps to support the building of professional relationships and effective, sustained team work.</p><p>There has been a strong focus, with the new leadership structure in place, on finding out about the quality of practice and effectiveness of operation. Good support is provided from management for developing understanding and use of self review at team leader and visiting teacher level. Workshops and professional readings incorporate sound models of evaluation. The plan to develop national quality standards should support ongoing review and development of practice.</p><p>To date, the appraisal process has not been sufficiently robust, nor effectively used, to strengthen leaders’ and visiting teachers’ practice. A revised and recently implemented process should provide effective support for managers and teachers in their roles and build capability within the network. The recently developed Barnardos' professional standards should promote teachers’ understanding of the organisation’s expectations for their development.</p><p>A suitable range of policies and written guidelines, and revised induction procedures, provide effective support for visiting teachers and educators to understand Barnardos' expectations and legislative requirements for home-based education and care.</p><p>An appropriate focus on establishing relationships and enhanced communication at all levels of the organisation is evident. Useful systems support the sharing of Barnardos' information with educators and parents. An agreed next step is to strengthen the purpose and quality of meetings between team leaders and visiting teachers.</p><p>Barnardos has a carefully considered strategic plan that is supporting the transformation of this service. It is suitably focused on children and retention of families, teachers and educators. Key personnel have been appointed to manage projects and lead working groups to achieve goals. The need to develop leadership skills within the organisation is acknowledged. Identification of strategic goals at local level should be a focus for management once the team leader role is confirmed. Further defining desired outcomes by identifying internal measures of quality should support ongoing review and decision making about next steps. Other priorities identified by management are the development of a clear vision and philosophy to guide practice in KidStart home-based services.</p><p>Barnardos' practice strategy effectively highlights critical elements associated with providing early learning programmes. It is highly improvement and quality focused. Next development steps are clearly articulated. They seek to address curriculum issues identified in the 2012 ERO review of this network and the need for improving the capability and sustainability of practice.</p><p>A variety of checklists and audits are used at visiting teacher level to check ongoing compliance of educators’ practice with regulations and Barnardos expectations. Quality assurance at management level needs improvement. Strengthening checks of visiting teachers’ practice should assist with the timely identification of issues relating to their support and the quality of educators’ programmes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><ul>
<li>Barnardos and ERO agree the most important priority is:
<ul>
<li>the continued development and embedding of practices that build capability and sustainable practice at all levels and result in consistently high quality outcomes for children.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At governance level, the priorities are the development of:
<ul>
<li>a vision and philosophy for KidStart Home-Based-Education and Care</li>
<li>strategic goals for this network with quality outcomes identified</li>
<li>thinking around Māori success</li>
<li>improved quality assurance</li>
<li>the Pacific Plan to better support outcomes for Pacific children</li>
<li>curriculum and programmes for children aged up-to-two years</li>
<li>leadership skills within the networks</li>
<li>and successful use of the appraisal process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At local level, the priorities are:
<ul>
<li>appointing a permanent team leader</li>
<li>making a decision about the network team’s position in the organisation</li>
<li>building the sense of team</li>
<li>effective and sustained support for educators to improve their understanding and implementation of assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>development of the team leader’s and visiting teachers’ understanding and use of evaluation</li>
<li>partnership with parents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Barnardos KidStart Childcare Manawatu East Home-Based Service completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practice management must ensure that educators have a first-aid certificate prior to commencing work.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service works in consultation with the Ministry of Education to progress the key next steps outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Barnardos KidStart Childcare Manawatu East Home-Based Service will be within two years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><p>4 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
