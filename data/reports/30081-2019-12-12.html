</table><p align="center" style="text-align: left;">Home Grown Kids (South)&nbsp;<span>is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</span></p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Home Grown Kids (South) provides individual home-based education and care within the Canterbury region for infants and children up to school age. This network is part of the national Edubase organisation. Each educator is licensed to have up to four children under five years old, including two children under two years.</p><p>Home Grown Kids (South) is a standard funded network. The network has a qualified visiting teacher who is responsible for the day-to-day support of 7 experienced educators. A new chief executive and national senior leadership team are responsible for the effective operation of the service. The senior leadership team includes a professional teaching and learning leader. This leader works closely with the visiting teacher to help educators deliver teaching and learning underpinned by Te Wh&#257;riki (2017) the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The organisation and the network have undergone significant organisational, management and leadership changes since new ownership in 2017. Relicensing of the service included extensive work ensuring all Ministry of Education regulatory requirements, including health and safety, were met. The Ministry of Education issued a full license in March 2019. A new governance, management and leadership structure was established in September 2019.</p><p>The vision of the service is to 'enable all tamariki to learn, grow and thrive in a home-based setting'.</p><p>The network philosophy has a focus on small group in-home care, with an emphasis on treating children with dignity and respect, play-based learning, parent partnerships, and respect for the language, culture and identity of children and their families.</p><p>This review was one of two network reviews in the Edubase national organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service providers and leaders, including the visiting teacher, promote positive, reciprocal relationships to support educators with the learning and wellbeing of children in the home-base care environments. The pedagogical leader is providing health and safety professional learning for educators within the network.</p><p>The visiting teacher is effectively promoting professional learning partnerships with and between educators. She is an active participant in the local education community, fostering links with other home-based services, early learning services and local schools. The visiting teacher schedules time for regular playgroups for the social benefit of children and the educators. This time is also used by the visiting teacher to share and model positive practice for learning.</p><p>The specific needs of infants, toddlers and young children are supported by a consistent and familiar educator. The language, culture and identity of children and their families are acknowledged and respected. There is a deliberate focus on developing bicultural perspectives and te ao M&#257;ori understandings. Emphasis is given to the provision of respectful and nurturing interactions within a small group setting. The visiting teacher is providing useful written feedback for educators in relation to the service priorities of health, safety and curriculum.</p><p>The deliberate appointment of skilled and experienced leaders has resulted in a strategic and well considered approach to managing change. Leaders have set high expectations in regard to maintaining regulatory requirements as a minimum, and building quality processes and practices. They have developed a shared vision and service priorities that are focused on health and safety accountability, quality curriculum provision and capability building. Leaders have made good use of external professional development to begin to build understandings of inquiry and reflective practices focused on ongoing improvement and positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the senior leader and visiting teacher agree that the key next steps at a national and regional level are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>refine strategic planning to include annual action planning, monitoring, evaluation and reporting of identified service priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extend knowledge and capability of evaluative practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>give greater prominence to bicultural perspectives in key documents and practices, to support a bicultural curriculum for all children and success for M&#257;ori children as M&#257;ori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop the quality and consistency of the curriculum, particularly in relation to assessment, planning and evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Home Grown Kids (South) completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>12 December 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children.

<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
