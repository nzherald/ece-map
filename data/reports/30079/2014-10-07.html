</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Montessori @ Rimu is a privately owned centre located in Forest Lake, Hamilton. It is licensed for up to 26 children over two years of age. There has been a recent change of ownership of the centre. The new owner is a qualified early childhood teacher and she also owns and manages another early childhood service in Auckland.</p><p>Since the change of ownership in April 2014 improvements have been made to the indoor and outdoor environment. Consultation with families has established good communication processes. The manager has also developed networks with other Montessori centres and identified priorities for staff professional development.</p><p>The centre's philosophy has been reviewed and maintains an emphasis on a Montessori curriculum which incorporates the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The centre manager and teachers have developed a shared vision to work closely with parents/whānau and the community to empower, educate and support children in a safe, orderly, warm and happy environment.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from an environment that is welcoming and inclusive. They experience close and trusting relationships with teachers and develop close friendships with their peers. In this mixed age group setting older children regularly take responsibility for younger children’s wellbeing.</p><p>The classroom is well prepared with high quality, specialised Montessori equipment that introduces a broad range of learning activities. These are purposefully designed to promote children’s skills, knowledge and concept development.</p><p>Children are familiar with centre routines and the use of the equipment. They are free to choose from activities that enhance their learning in mathematics, literacy, social studies, science and the arts and practical life learning. In addition, children have exposure to the French language which is taught one day a week.</p><p>Teachers are knowledgeable about Montessori teaching and learning, carefully observe children’s engagement with Montessori equipment, and note their progress in mastering tasks and skills. Teachers model high levels of respect when interacting with children.</p><p>Teachers know children well and involve them in conversations that extend their language and learning. Children are well supported in their classroom exploration and learning by focused one-to-one interactions with their teachers. Priority is given to children's classroom work but teachers are currently reviewing their routines to ensure there is good opportunity to experience outdoor play.</p><p>Teachers have undertaken professional development in bicultural practices and implemented a stronger Māori dimension. They acknowledge a need to continue building their practice in order to strengthen Māori culture, language and identity in the curriculum. Teachers have a framework to review aspects of their practice and use it to reflect on ways to improve. They appreciate the provision the new owner/manager has made for professional development.</p><p>Teachers have positive relationships with parents and they take the time to speak with them individually. Parent/teacher evenings enable them to have more in depth discussion about the child’s learning and progress. The new centre owner/manager has worked hard to develop meaningful communication with parents and has consulted with them about her plans for centre improvement. Parents spoken with by ERO expressed high levels of satisfaction with the quality of education and care their children are receiving.</p><p>The owner visits the centre weekly to undertake management responsibilities of the service and provide leadership for the teaching team. Teachers work as a collegial team dedicated to the implementation of the Montessori philosophy of education.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the centre owner/manager and teachers agree that priority areas for development are:</p><ul>
<li>to improve the quality of planned self review. This should include deliberate research and inquiry to make more informed decisions about ongoing improvements</li>
<li>strengthening assessment and programme planning practices to better reflect individual children’s learning and progress in a range of contexts.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Montessori @ Rimu completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>Management and teachers access relevant professional development in assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Montessori @ Rimu will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>7 October 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
