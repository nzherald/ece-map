<a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Background</span></h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Lollipops Educare Albany governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the March 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>the quality of support and guidance for staff including professional development and appraisal</li>
<li>the extent to which policies, procedures and support programmes are aligned to management expectations</li>
<li>the extent to which self review is promoting positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>the quality and quantity of resources and equipment available to children</li>
<li>any other issues relevant to the management and operation of the centre that arise during the course of this review.</li>
</ul><a id="2-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>2 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Lollipops Educare Albany, on Auckland’s North Shore, provides education and care for children from birth to school age in a modern, purpose built facility. The centre is licensed for 123 children, including 50 under 2 years. The Lollipops organisation provides management and administration support.</p><p>The Lollipops organisation had resumed control of the centre in 2011 just prior to the last ERO review. At that time ERO found considerable changes were necessary to improve current practice. Centre managers agreed they needed to support staff to improve practice in all areas of centre management.</p><p>Many changes have been made to the leadership team. The Lollipops organisation has supported the new team to focus on the areas identified for improvement. Leaders and teachers have worked collaboratively to make significant improvements to centre and teacher practice.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><a id="3-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>At the time of the last ERO review, policies and procedures did not give clear support and guidance to teachers about their roles and responsibilities. Professional development and appraisal processes were not promoting effective teacher development outcomes. Children had limited resources to play with. The Lollipops organisation took over the centre in 2011 and initiatives for change were put in place. The management team was receptive and responsive to ERO’s findings.</p><p>Managers are committed to improving centre practices. The March 2012 ERO report has been used by the organisation as a guide to help manage and focus initiatives. Collaborative teamwork has enabled managers to implement many changes. Teachers have responded positively to clearer guidance and direction. Improvements made to the programme and teachers’ practice are designed to benefit children. The management team is proud of what has been achieved.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>Teachers have benefitted from the support and guidance of the recent professional development and the new appraisal system. Centre management has taken a deliberate and realistic approach to implementing professional development. Staff have participated in whole centre professional learning. Their positive participation has helped to support the alignment of practice across the rooms and has increased collaboration within and between teams.</p><p>An appraisal process that involves regular meetings, goal setting, opportunities for discussion and feedback is in place. Teachers develop action plans to help monitor progress towards achieving their professional development goals.</p><p>Policies and procedures have been rationalised and aligned to management expectations. Teachers have been involved in reviewing policies and parent consultation has been undertaken. Policies and procedures now guide centre operations and are referred to regularly.</p><p>Self review is promoting positive outcomes for children. Parents, management, teachers and children have all contributed to reviews that have resulted in significant changes to programmes and centre layout. The establishment of the Pukeko Chicks room has eased the transition of children from the Kiwis to the Pukeko room.</p><p>Managers report teachers are increasingly using self review to make improvements. The Lollipops review cycle will guide the focus of planned and regular reviews. Teachers in each of the room plan to undertake action research projects next year.</p><p>The quality and quantity of resources available to children have been improved. An inventory of existing resources was compared to Ministry of Education guidelines. This formed the basis for initial purchases. The Lollipops organisation supported managers well to improve resources.</p><p>Team leaders continue to build resources by purchasing for particular programmes that match children’s areas of interest. Children’s access to a greater variety and quantity of resources has helped to extend thinking and to foster complexity in children’s play.</p><h3>Areas for further development</h3><p>Managers and staff must now embed the recently developed management and teaching practices. Ongoing monitoring and review is necessary to ensure the improvements are sustained.</p><p>Centre mangers and staff need to find ways to promote Te Whāriki, the Ministry of Education Early Childhood Curriculum and what teachers know about good practice in education and care, while responding to parent expectations of the programme and routines.</p><a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendation</h2><p>ERO recommends that:</p><p>Lollipops centre support manager continues to support the centre manager and team leaders to embed improved practice.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>18 January 2013</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>
