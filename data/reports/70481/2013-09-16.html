</table><p>Tiny Tots Preschool is w<em>ell placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tiny Tots Preschool is privately owned and located in Linwood, Christchurch. The centre is licensed for 50 children aged from birth to school age. Families from a range of cultural backgrounds use the centre. The centre provides a full day education and care programme and is strongly focused on caring for and supporting children and their families to achieve positive outcomes for children. The service is managed by the owner-director and the centre supervisor who are both qualified and registered early childhood teachers. During the 2011 earthquakes, the staff and children had to vacate their badly damaged building and set up in another part of the community. They are now back on their original site where the buildings and outdoor areas have been fully upgraded to meet the needs of the children who are now at different developmental stages.</p><p>A good range of resources and equipment support teachers to provide learning experiences that are meaningful to children.</p><p>Most teachers are fully qualified and provisionally registered. The managers and staff have made significant progress in the areas identified as needing improvement in ERO’s 2009 report. The interactions in the nursery are positive and children are well cared for. A more useful appraisal process includes teachers’ reflections about the difference their good practice is making to outcomes for children. The director and staff have focused on strengthening their bicultural programme so that children and their families/whānau are now able to hear and use te reo Māori and experience positive relationships in the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy is strongly evident throughout the programme. The centre’s strategic goals and plans are influenced by the aspirations parents have for their children. Teachers are highly-focused on planning programmes to meet children’s individual needs. Parents are able to contribute to the planning and often help by suggesting goals for their children.</p><p>Children enjoy happy, caring relationships with their teachers. Babies and toddlers are warmly nurtured in ways that are settling and comforting. Teachers celebrate the cultural backgrounds of children and staff. The managers and teachers have had useful professional development to increase their knowledge and strengthen their confidence in using te reo Māori. ERO heard te reo Māori being frequently used by teachers and children throughout the programme. The next step is for managers to make the bicultural aspects more visible in the centre’s documents.</p><p>Teachers know the children well and work together to support their wellbeing and development. They provide a range of social, physical and creative activities to enable children to reach their full potential. Teachers effectively use an inquiry approach to provide learning experiences that satisfy children’s curiosity about the world around them. Children are fully aware of sustainable practices. They regularly recycle food, know about their worm farm and eat the vegetables from their garden.</p><p>The centre is inclusive of all children. Staff are learning to use sign language to achieve improved communication with parents with hearing impairment. Many children confidently use sign language to communicate with each other. Teachers seek the support of specialists when necessary, to meet the specific needs of individual children.</p><p>Parents have good opportunities to contribute to the programme. They help to decide the goals for their children, provide useful feedback to staff about the programme and add helpful comments to their children’s learning stories. The centre managers make good provision for parents to attend parent education evenings to support their children’s growth and development.</p><p>Teachers help to prepare children for transition within the centre and on to school through the individual programmes planned to meet children’s needs. Children have many opportunities to develop their concepts about words, symbols and mathematical language such as counting, weighing things, days of the week, cooking and baking. The next step is for the centre supervisor to develop a closer relationship with local schools so that professional information can be shared as a way of better supporting children’s transition to school.</p><p>The centre managers have ensured that all aspects of the centre’s programme are closely linked to the strategic direction of the service. They are strongly focused on ongoing improvement and are willingly guided by the feedback they receive from children, parents and staff. The well-planned self-review programme is complemented by spontaneous reviews that make sure children’s needs are well met. The director and the supervisor use the strengths of the staff to provide strong leadership that benefits children and their families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps are for the managers and staff to:</p><ul>
<li>fully embed the programme planning and appraisal systems</li>
<li>make the bicultural aspects more visible in the centre documents.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tiny Tots Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tiny Tots Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>16 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
