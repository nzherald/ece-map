</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Reanga Childcare Centre is a community based service that offers all day care and education. It caters for up to 39 children in two separate areas, one for those aged up to two years and one for those aged over two years. Eleven children identify as Māori.</p><p>The philosophy is grounded in Māori conceptual beliefs of whakawhānaungatanga. Positive relationships with parents and community are fostered. Teachers, parents, families and whānau work in partnership, acknowledging and respecting children’s unique and diverse cultural backgrounds.</p><p>Most staff are qualified and experienced early childhood teachers. Several have worked at the centre for a long period of time. The centre is supported by a management committee which has parent, whānau and community members and staff representation.</p><p>Positive aspects of practice identified in the October 2012 ERO report continue to be evident.</p><p>Management and governance provide a sound foundation for the centre to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience positive, responsive and respectful relationships with teachers and peers. They are involved learners who converse comfortably and confidently with others. They explore and participate in unhurried ways.</p><p>Teachers respond to children’s rhythms and encourage positive communication skills. Opportunities for children to make choices are evident. Engagement in childled and planned experiences supports their learning. Literacy and numeracy are integrated throughout the programme.</p><p>Infants and toddlers engage in rich experiences which build their capability. A range of strategies is used to cater for their individual growth. These strategies include;</p><ul>
<li>affirming the rights of the child</li>
<li>using visual images of the child’s world and pictures of the wider world</li>
<li>deliberate planning using specific resources</li>
<li>bilingual waiata.</li>
</ul><p>Recent professional learning has promoted teachers’ understandings of inclusive education and supported their interactions with individual children.</p><p>Transition processes offer continuity of experiences for children as they move from the centre and on to school. A well-considered approach that ensures children’s wellbeing is supported through the different environments is in place.</p><p>Teachers are increasingly confident to implement te reo me ngā tikanga Māori through routines and daily practice. Children are responsive and enthusiastic in the use of te reo. They are engaged learners who participate in mihimihi, routines and rituals which include tikanga, karakia and waiata. Children offer contributions and are active listeners. Te ao Māori values and beliefs of manākitanga and whanaungatanga are integrated through the centre’s teaching and learning practices.</p><p>Childrens' conversations with peers and adults extend their language skills and thinking. Teachers are responsive to children’s temperaments, preferences and interests.</p><p>The curriculum aligns with the principles and strands of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum<em>.</em> Infants', toddlers' and young children's ideas and learning are listened to, recognised and documented. Teachers encourage development through dialogue and planned experiences. Children’s culture, language and identity are affirmed.</p><p>A new appraisal processes has been introduced over the last two years and continues to be strengthened.</p><p>A focus since the previous ERO review has been self review and appraisal. Teachers continue to develop their understanding of purposeful self review. Involvement in centre professional learning and development has strengthened teachers' capability to determine relevant aspects for curriculum review and useful changes to practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre management agree to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop assessment and planning systems</li>
<li>strengthen shared understanding of internal evaluation centre-wide</li>
<li>strengthen culturally responsive practices for Māori learners by integrating into practice, <em>Tātaiako - Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners.</em></li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Reanga Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Reanga Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>20 October 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"> ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
