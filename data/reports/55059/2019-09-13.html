</table><p>Tamatea Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tamatea Playcentre is in Napier and operates under the umbrella of Playcentre Aotearoa. The service is licensed to provide mixed-age sessional education and care for 25 children, two days a week. This includes 15 children up to the age of two.</p><p>Since the November 2016 ERO report, the New Zealand Playcentre Federation has restructured by amalgamating all associations to form Playcentre Aotearoa. Tamatea Playcentre is part of the Lower North Island regional hub, supported by a regional manager and support persons.</p><p>Centre support workers and centre administrators employed by Playcentre Aotearoa regularly visit playcentres. Their role is to provide professional advice and feedback to strengthen practice and promote improvement. Responsibility for day-to-day operation is undertaken by centre-elected office holders. Centre members share the duties associated with implementing the programme.</p><p>The previous ERO report for Tamatea Playcentre identified that the following areas required development:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment knowledge and practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>curriculum and resources to respond to infants' and toddlers' needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing parents' conversations and questioning during play to prompt children's exploration of their interests.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Centre members have made progress in responding to these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine reviews in Playcentre Aotearoa, Lower North Island.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Playcentre Aotearoa philosophy of 'whānau tupu ngātahi – families growing together' guides centre practices. Centre members acknowledge that it is timely to review the service's philosophy to develop shared understanding, specific to Tamatea Playcentre, as many families are new to the playcentre.</p><p>Children experience positive, warm and respectful interactions with adults. They enthusiastically engage in an environment that is well resourced to meet their individual interests and learning needs. These include early literacy, mathematics and science experiences and opportunities to engage with the wider community. Children and their families are encouraged to share their first languages and cultures. Infants and toddlers are provided with developmentally appropriate resources that support their participation and learning.</p><p>Centre members have refined and developed assessment and planning processes to better support their responses to children’s interests. These include wall displays that show children’s current interests and ways adults can provide resources and activities to promote these. Further development should include a stronger emphasis on identifying and responding to children’s learning.</p><p>Some te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are incorporated into daily practices. Centre members have identified that further support is required to build adults' confidence and use of te reo Māori to support children's learning.</p><p>Experienced centre members are modelling language interactions during play that contribute to extending children's learning. Parents provide collaborative leadership and value the skills and knowledge of each other. Office holders have recently implemented a session coordination role that supports all members to increase their contribution and share responsibilities. The growing participation in the adult education programme impacts positively on the quality of the sessions.</p><p>There is a deliberate commitment to improving internal evaluation. Centre members' recent involvement in professional learning, related to effective internal evaluation processes, is helping them to grow their understanding. Planned and spontaneous reviews are used to reflect on aspects of practice.</p><p>Annual planning is not yet guiding centre operation. Centre members require further support to develop, implement and monitor an annual plan. Assistance for centre members is also required to consistently implement Playcentre Aotearoa procedures that ensure ongoing regulatory compliance.</p><p>Playcentre Aotearoa are reviewing their strategic plan. The 2014 to 2019 plan identifies useful priorities and goals towards achieving the Playcentre vision. Further consideration by centre members is needed to develop useful objectives and success criteria for Tamatea Playcentre that will align to the service's annual plan. Playcentre Aotearoa and members should continue to use internal evaluation to identify how well their practices improve outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre support worker provides written reports that generally affirm environmental developments and programme practices. These records are beginning to focus on outcomes for children and next steps for centre members to improve teaching and learning. Reports should focus on providing centre members with evaluative feedback that assists them to sustain and further enhance the good practice.</p><p>Appraisal for the centre support workers, centre administrators and session facilitators requires improving. Further attention should be given to developing deliberate strategies for working towards educators' inquiry goals and making links to relevant professional learning and development. Supporting staff to strengthen their knowledge of high-quality practice should be a key next step.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Playcentre Aotearoa should further support centre members to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop an annual plan to guide centre operation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>align the centre's annual plan and objectives with the Playcentre Aotearoa strategic plan to strengthen internal evaluation and improve outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve understanding of the legislative and regulatory requirements of a licensed early learning service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embed assessment, planning and evaluation practices to guide future teaching and learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Playcentre Aotearoa should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improve appraisal processes for the centre support workers, centre administrators and session facilitators to enhance their professional growth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to support leaders to build centre members' understanding of effective internal evaluation through ongoing mentoring that helps them to measure the impact of practices on children’s learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO's evaluation shows that increased oversight and guidance from the organisation is needed to progress the playcentres' areas for development and to better meet legislative requirements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tamatea Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop an annual plan that guides the service's operation. <br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA8]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>13 September 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
