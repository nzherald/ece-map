<html><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Yendarra Kindergarten is a well established kindergarten, in Otara, South Auckland, and is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association. The Association provides professional and administrative support and a framework of policies and procedures. Since the 2009 ERO review the kindergarten has changed from a sessional to full day kindergarten, so that children are able to attend for longer hours. A new head teacher is in place.</p><p align="left">Mutually respectful and responsive relationships with children and their parents/wh&#257;nau continue to be a strength of the kindergarten. Teachers have a strong commitment to biculturalism and use te reo M&#257;ori in meaningful ways. They also frequently use Rarotongan, Samoan and Tongan in conversation and play, to affirm children&rsquo;s culture and identity. Parents and wh&#257;nau share their skills and knowledge in the kindergarten, and are able to join in adult education programmes. As a result, there is a strong sense of wh&#257;nau and learning together in the kindergarten</p><p align="left">Children enthusiastically engage in sustained play. They are eager to learn and are active and capable participants in the programme. They share ideas about their play and activities, and show concern for others. Teachers interact skilfully with children in ways that provide good support for children&rsquo;s social competence and positive attitudes to learning.</p><p align="left">The physical environment celebrates children&rsquo;s culture and interests. Children&rsquo;s very good opportunities for play inside are complemented by a landscaped outside area that reflects M&#257;ori and Pacific culture, provides physical challenge, and fosters imaginative play and science exploration.</p><p align="left">Teachers provide a good quality programme that values the aspirations of parents and is responsive to children&rsquo;s interests. Individual portfolio records (tohu) of children&rsquo;s learning are highly valued by families. Teachers integrate early literacy, numeracy and science concepts in appropriate ways. They encourage children to use information and communication technologies (ICT) and learn through child- initiated play. Teachers could now increase strategies that extend children&rsquo;s independent thinking and problem-solving skills.</p><p align="left">Teachers work collaboratively and have continued to enhance the programme, the environment and their teaching practice through in-depth professional development and robust self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Yendarra Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atYendarra Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Since the 2009 ERO review, the kindergarten has changed to a kindergarten all day model. The number of teachers has increased to three. Teachers are assisted by an administrator and by wh&#257;nau of past and present children who have worked voluntarily over a number of years.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Stimulating environment. Teachers provide a very well resourced and stimulating learning environment that:</p><ul>
<li>supports children&rsquo;s engagement in sustained play</li>
<li>promotes different types of play</li>
<li>responsibility for self-care and the centre&rsquo;s resourcesencourages children to develop</li>
</ul><p align="left">Carved pou (poles) representing the M&#257;ori gods of Rongomatane and inside of Tane Mahuta continue to welcome visitors and make connections to the past. The landscaped outside area promotes active and imaginative play and includes a garden that contributes to the centre focus on sustainability and a healthy life style. Displays of children&rsquo;s creative art work, photographs and observations encourage discussion, and enable children and adults to share and revisit prior activities and experiences. This is complemented by inclusive, welcoming practices that support children&rsquo;s self esteem and sense of belonging.</p><p align="left">Community and parent partnership. Well established and positive relationships with parents, wh&#257;nau and the local community are a strength of the kindergarten. Teachers respectfully encourage active parent participation in the programme and parent education programmes. Teachers have good processes to support children&rsquo;s transition to school and regularly invite visitors from the local community. Children benefit from wh&#257;nau support and partnership in their education.</p><p align="left">Philosophy in action. Teachers provide good support for children&rsquo;s developing social competence and positive attitude to learning. Their teaching philosophy is regularly reviewed, clearly articulated and underpins teacher practice. They value child-initiated play, acknowledge children as capable learners and build on children&rsquo;s strengths. Their commitment to biculturalism is evident in documents and the use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in meaningful and natural ways. Children&rsquo;s self esteem and pride in their own cultural identity and ability to learn is evident.</p><p align="left">Programme in action. Teachers implement a child-focused programme that is responsive to children&rsquo;s ideas. They encourage children to make choices investigate and learn through play. They extend children&rsquo;s understanding of the world around them in meaningful ways. Teacher-initiated experiences are skilfully integrated into the programme and interactive mat times offer good opportunities for children to be actively involved. Literacy, both written and oral, has a high profile in the kindergarten. Teachers facilitate a supportive and inclusive atmosphere that assists all children to be involved in the programme.</p><p align="left">Competent confident children. Children are confident, enthusiastic learners. They have good opportunities to develop imaginative play and experiment with creative activities, such as singing and dancing. Children can select freely from a very good variety of books to share with peers and adults. They are familiar with mathematical language and ideas. Science concepts, particularly those of the natural world, are investigated in situations that build on children&rsquo;s knowledge, and often include the ideas of their wh&#257;nau. Children play cooperatively, share discoveries and have a strong sense of belonging.</p><p align="left">Self review. Self-review processes are effectively used and clearly evident in programme implementation. Ongoing review of assessment and planning has refined these processes and documentation, including portfolios (Tohu), are highly valued and clearly show children&rsquo;s involvement in the programme. The teaching team have been together for a relatively short period of time and are developing a long-term strategic plan in collaboration with parents and wh&#257;nau.. This should assist teachers in sustaining a programme that includes teachers&rsquo;, parents&rsquo;/wh&#257;nau and children&rsquo;s ideas, strengths and aspirations.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Enhancing children&rsquo;s participation as planners. Teachers work skilfully with children to enrich their play and learning. They may like to consider developing further strategies that:</p><ul>
<li>continue to promote children&rsquo;s abilities as planners</li>
<li>extend children&rsquo;s independent thinking and problem-solving skills</li>
<li>increase opportunities for children to use literacy in the context of play</li>
<li>more clearly show the progression of children&rsquo;s individual learning interests in their portfolios.</li>
</ul><p align="left">This would further enhance the depth and quality of the existing good learning experiences for children, and their sense of being active partners in their own learning.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing wellbeing, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The kindergarten implements the policies and procedures of the Auckland Kindergarten Association in relation to the inclusion of children with special needs. The centre continues to have children with special needs attending. The kindergarten provides a welcoming and supportive environment for these children and their wh&#257;nau.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Teachers view all children as capable learners with individual needs and strengths. They know families well and work sensitively with parents/wh&#257;nau and external agencies in culturally responsive ways. Teachers ensure that children with special needs are included in all areas of the programme and are well supported by resources in areas of play. Their achievements and progress are well documented and shared with wh&#257;nau.</p><p align="left">Respectful and trusting relationships between teachers, education support workers and parents/wh&#257;nau are a strength of the kindergarten. Parents are encouraged to discuss any concerns or needs for external support. Teachers work in partnership with specialist services and wh&#257;nau to develop individual programmes that support children&rsquo;s development and engagement in play. Adults work collaboratively to ensure that children with special needs play in groups with peers, experience success and develop friendships</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4.

</table><p>&nbsp;</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-yendarra-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Yendarra Kindergarten</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Yendarra Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Yendarra Kindergarten is a well established kindergarten, in Otara, South Auckland, and is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association. The Association provides professional and administrative support and a framework of policies and procedures. Since the 2009 ERO review the kindergarten has changed from a sessional to full day kindergarten, so that children are able to attend for longer hours. A new head teacher is in place.</p><p align="left">Mutually respectful and responsive relationships with children and their parents/wh&#257;nau continue to be a strength of the kindergarten. Teachers have a strong commitment to biculturalism and use te reo M&#257;ori in meaningful ways. They also frequently use Rarotongan, Samoan and Tongan in conversation and play, to affirm children&rsquo;s culture and identity. Parents and wh&#257;nau share their skills and knowledge in the kindergarten, and are able to join in adult education programmes. As a result, there is a strong sense of wh&#257;nau and learning together in the kindergarten</p><p align="left">Children enthusiastically engage in sustained play. They are eager to learn and are active and capable participants in the programme. They share ideas about their play and activities, and show concern for others. Teachers interact skilfully with children in ways that provide good support for children&rsquo;s social competence and positive attitudes to learning.</p><p align="left">The physical environment celebrates children&rsquo;s culture and interests. Children&rsquo;s very good opportunities for play inside are complemented by a landscaped outside area that reflects M&#257;ori and Pacific culture, provides physical challenge, and fosters imaginative play and science exploration.</p><p align="left">Teachers provide a good quality programme that values the aspirations of parents and is responsive to children&rsquo;s interests. Individual portfolio records (tohu) of children&rsquo;s learning are highly valued by families. Teachers integrate early literacy, numeracy and science concepts in appropriate ways. They encourage children to use information and communication technologies (ICT) and learn through child- initiated play. Teachers could now increase strategies that extend children&rsquo;s independent thinking and problem-solving skills.</p><p align="left">Teachers work collaboratively and have continued to enhance the programme, the environment and their teaching practice through in-depth professional development and robust self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p align="left"><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
