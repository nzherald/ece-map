</table><p>Kindercare Learning Centres 211 is <em>very well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres 211 is located in Avonhead. It is one of 11 early childhood education and care centres, in Christchurch, owned and administered by Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd. The service owners have a strong philosophy, useful policies and procedures and a framework for monitoring health and safety. An area manager works in partnership with the centre director and the curriculum leader to support the effective operation of the centre.</p><p>The areas for review and development identified in the April 2011 ERO report, including self review, assessment and routines, have been successfully addressed. The centre director and curriculum leader have identified that aspects of long and short-term planning and evaluation could be further improved to build on the good practices evident during this review.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews in the Kindercare Learning Centres Service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers interact with children and foster their learning in ways that clearly reflect the Kindercare vision of being ‘safe, loved, and learning’. They are friendly, caring and inclusive, and they connect with children in meaningful ways. Children are well supported to initiate and maintain positive relationships with others. Teachers encourage and affirm children’s efforts and successes.</p><p>Teachers focus on the ways children learn and how they can use their interests to foster curiosity and exploration. Children actively engage in a wide range of interesting activities that encourage their participation and learning. Teachers respond positively to children through listening, questioning and talking with them. Conversations help children to extend their ideas and improve their oral language skills.</p><p>The service has provided additional staffing and resourcing to better support children who have additional needs.</p><p>Teachers in the under-two area are nurturing and unhurried in the ways they interact with and involve children. They carry out routines respectfully in ways that are suited to each child.</p><p>ERO observed confident, outgoing children who were settled and engaging well in learning activities. The purpose-built environment is well resourced to support children’s learning.</p><p>There is a strong commitment from teachers to promote partnerships in learning with parents and families. Parents and teachers share information to further support children’s learning and wellbeing. They are well informed about their children’s learning and interests through attractive and informative portfolios, journals and wall displays.</p><p>The language, culture and identity of children and their families are well recognised and affirmed. Children have opportunities to hear te reo Māori and to be involved in tikanga Māori practices that are respectful of the Māori culture. Teachers are encouraged to continually grow their bicultural practices and understanding of te ao Māori. Teachers regularly speak to children in their home languages to help them improve their English. Children, whose first language is not English, are very well supported by teachers who can speak their home language.</p><p>The centre has developed a close relationship with the local school to help children move on to school. Older children are linked with school buddies who visit the centre each week and spend time talking and reading with them. Centre children also visit the school.</p><p>Leadership of the curriculum is a strong feature of the centre’s operation. Centre leaders work with teachers to develop their teaching practices. The centre director effectively uses teacher appraisal and professional development to improve teaching and learning practices that benefit children. Teachers are given many opportunities to grow their professional skills. The centre director and curriculum leader provide effective leadership. They actively promote growth of leadership for other staff.</p><p>There is a strong culture of reflective practice and self review. Self review is collaborative and well documented. Teachers effectively use reflection to improve learning and teaching. They receive constructive and purposeful feedback from centre leaders.</p><p>The outcomes from review are used to improve the learning and wellbeing of children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre’s operation and curriculum is effectively guided by the Kindercare Service’s strategic goals. Senior managers have recently extended the strategic plan to identify indicators of success for their goals. They have identified that their next steps are to support each centre to refine:</p><ul>
<li>long-term and annual planning so that it can prioritise how it will meet the Kindercare vision and goals</li>
<li>a planned approach to self review that aligns to centre priorities and the service’s goals.</li>
</ul><p>ERO and centre leaders have identified steps to further improve planning and assessment documentation. These include:</p><ul>
<li>more consistently identifying intentional teaching strategies in planning</li>
<li>capturing children’s views in both assessment and planning</li>
<li>strengthening evaluation and the impact of teaching strategies on the planned programme.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres 211 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres 211 will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>26 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
