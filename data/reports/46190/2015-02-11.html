</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>White Heron @ Dawson in Otara, Auckland, is a newly established, privately owned service. It provides full day and sessional care and education for up to 80 children, including 20 children up to two years of age. The majority of children enrolled are of Māori or Pacific Island descent. At the time of ERO’s review the roll was full. This centre is one of four located in south Auckland operating under the umbrella of White Heron Learning Centres Limited.</p><p>This service is ably led and managed by the owner and centre manager. Together, they have responded positively to recent feedback from ERO regarding improvements to practice for other services that they operate. The teaching team’s professional learning and development has been well supported and extended. This is this centre’s first education review.</p><p>Children are cared for in three aged related rooms. Children’s movement between rooms is not restricted and they take advantage of opportunities to move throughout the centre. Each room has an allocated outdoor play space. Teachers often take children out into the park next door and to the library nearby.</p><p>The service’s philosophy provides a sound foundation for the programme and teaching practices. The aims are to create respectful and reciprocal relationships, instil traditional values, enhance children’s language and build their sense of self and identity. Staff place a high priority on promoting children’s individuality and cultural backgrounds and developing a sense of community with children and parents.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and ownership. It is clear that they are at the heart of centre operations. They and their families are greeted warmly on arrival. Children’s diverse home languages are often used to greet and talk with children, families and staff. The cultural diversity of the community is reflected in the make-up of the teaching team.</p><p>Children are developing a good sense of their own identity. They also display knowledge of and respect for the identities of others. They settle happily into play, either in small and friendly groups, or they follow their own interests exploring the thoughtfully set out resources and environment.</p><p>Children demonstrate pride in their accomplishments and engage well with each other and teachers. They are confident to approach adults with questions and conversation. Teachers talk with children in authentic and genuine ways. Teachers skilfully extend, affirm and challenge children’s thinking. Children are being well supported to manage things for themselves and become more independent. The service’s strong focus on respect for self, others and the environment is evident in all interactions.</p><p>Children have good opportunities to develop their literacy and mathematics understandings and skills in real life contexts. Teachers are supporting parents’ growing knowledge of <em>Te Whariki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, which is well integrated into the programme and highly visible in centre documentation.</p><p>Children’s learning is well documented in their portfolios. Children’s portfolios acknowledge the significance of whānau or aiga, not only to the child but to the centre. Opportunities for Māori and Pacific Island children to achieve success in their respective cultures are the foundation of the programme. These opportunities are seamlessly woven through all aspects of centre operations.</p><p>Parents’ aspirations for their children’s learning are recorded and responded to. Parents spoken to by ERO talked about their high levels of satisfaction with the service and their close communication and connection to the teaching team. Partnerships with parents are particularly evident in the infant room where strong bonds exist between children and teachers.</p><p>Each individual child is acknowledged and valued. Teachers thoughtfully consider what children and their whānau/aiga bring to the centre and how they might respectfully build on children’s knowledge. Centre leaders could now consider how they might use this information further, supporting and encouraging whānau to make effective contributions to the centre programme.</p><p>Managers have established a vision and appointed leaders who have developed a philosophy appropriate to this setting. The service’s vision and philosophy are strongly reflected in practice. Professional feedback has been well considered and incorporated into centre processes and procedures.</p><p>Centre leaders provide good leadership models. This has supported teachers to develop confidence in voicing their own thoughts and ideas. Self review has been used to influence change in teaching practice. These factors support a deepening, shared understanding of how quality teaching practices contribute to positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that in order to further improve outcomes for children, they could:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen their gathering of children’s “voice” and include this in programme planning and assessment practices</li>
<li>continue to develop appraisal systems to encourage deeper inquiry and critical reflection by the teaching team</li>
<li>provide leadership training that will continue to grow the teachers' leadership potential.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of White Heron @ Dawson completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of White Heron @ Dawson will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>Northern</p><p>11 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
