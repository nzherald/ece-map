</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Early Explorers Childcare Centre provides education and care for up to 50 children from three months to school age. It is open on week days from 7am to 6pm. Children are cared for in two age-related rooms. Each room has an outside area. The younger children move to the older age group area when they are approximately two years of age. Children and their teachers are from many different cultural back grounds.</p><p>The centre owners/managers employ a team leader to supervise teaching and learning across the centre. Two qualified teachers work with children in each room, alongside staff who are in training or unqualified. Recently two new teachers have been employed.</p><p>The centre's philosophy focuses on providing time, space and freedom for children to develop as individuals who are confident to take risks, enjoy challenge and persevere while having fun.</p><p>ERO's 2013 report identified the need for teachers to extend children's learning, increase opportunities for children to understand aspects of Māori language and culture, and to develop strategies for positive behaviour management. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are well known to staff and benefit from friendly and supportive relationships with them. Children enjoy the spacious environment and move freely between the indoor and outdoor areas. They play uninterrupted by routines for much of the day.</p><p>The younger children benefit from the relatively high number of staff. Teachers follow children's individual routines and their conversations with children support good oral language development. Children's independence and resilience is encouraged. Teachers communicate regularly with children's whanau/families.</p><p>Teachers use effective strategies to support children who speak a language other than English at home. Early literacy and numeracy skills and knowledge are promoted through activities and the discussions that children and teachers have during play. Children have opportunities to learn about science and technology and to be creative.</p><p>Teachers are being well supported by managers to strengthen the assessment of children's learning in order to guide programme planning. Teachers sometimes record information about children's play in ways that show the development of their learning over time and how teaching has supported that learning. Parents are encouraged to contribute to their child's portfolio and to share their aspirations for their children during their time at the centre.</p><p>Teachers increasingly include aspects of te reo and tikanga Māori in the programme. Children and their families respond positively to this aspect of children's learning. Centre managers are now considering how they can include more learning from the cultures of the other children who attend the centre. They plan to focus on how well they support the identity of children from Pacific cultures.</p><p>Transitions into the centre and on to school are sensitively supported by teachers. They work with school leaders to ensure that children have positive experiences when they go to school. Children move from the younger age group to the older age group gradually, when they are ready to move.</p><p>The centre is well managed. Policies that guide centre operations are reviewed regularly. Procedures related to health and safety are well managed. Effective self-review processes are followed and all staff are involved in both planned reviews and reviews that arise incidentally during the year. Self review contributes to annual and long-term strategic planning.</p><p>The managers have established a centre culture that is focused on ongoing improvement. Staff meet regularly to discuss children's learning, programme planning, professional development and other centre operations. This helps all staff to take an interest in making positive changes.</p><p>Because of the appointment of new staff and the significant professional development over the last three years, it would be timely now to review the centre philosophy. Part of the review could involve discussion about the desirable outcomes for children and the teachers' role in promoting these outcomes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO suggests that centre managers continue to guide staff to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>use what they learn about children through effective assessment to plan programmes that are responsive to the interests and dispositions of groups and individuals, and that promote children's inquiry and problem solving skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the layout and resourcing of the environment to maximise educational opportunities for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that appraisal processes are robust, support improvement in teaching and learning, and meet the requirements of the Teachers' Council.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Early Explorers Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Early Explorers Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>28 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
