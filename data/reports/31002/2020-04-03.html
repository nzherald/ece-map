</table><p>Arohena Playcentre requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Arohena Playcentre requires further development so that Playcentre Aotearoa, leaders and parents ensure compliance with all health and safety licensing requirements, as outlined in the <em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Services 2008.</em></p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Arohena Playcentre is licensed to provide mixed-age sessional education and care for 25 children in two mornings a week. This includes 10 children up to the age of two years. At the time of this review, there are 21 children enrolled and six identify as Māori. The centre is located in a rural area, adjoining Arohena Hall and close to the local school. The playcentre and school have well established links and regularly participate in combined events together. Families attending consist of permanent local residents and some from more seasonal farming backgrounds.</p><p>Since the June 2016 ERO report, the New Zealand Playcentre Federation has restructured by amalgamating all associations to form Playcentre Aotearoa. Arohena Playcentre is part of the Central North Island Region and is supported by a regional manager and support persons.</p><p>Whānau and families share responsibility for the curriculum. Day-to-day operation is undertaken by session support personnel and centre-elected office holders. A centre support worker and centre administrator regularly visit playcentres to provide professional guidance, strengthen practice and promote improvement.</p><p>The Playcentre Aotearoa philosophy, ‘<span lang="mi">whānau tupu ngātahi</span> – families growing together’, is to empower parents and children to learn, play and grow together. The centre philosophy places priority on children initiating their own play, supporting emergent leadership, creativity and fun in a mixed-age setting.</p><p>Progress is ongoing in relation to the areas identified in the June 2016 ERO report relating to assessment of children’s learning, and the provision of literacy and numeracy for older learners.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews in the New Zealand Playcentre Federation (NZPF) Central North Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Arohena Playcentre is providing a welcoming and inclusive service, supporting children and young families within a remote, rural area. There is strong community support for the well-resourced playcentre.</p><p>Members report that the relative isolation of the area is a barrier to engaging in adult education workshops. Some adults have started the playcentre introduction course and the centre is supported by members holding sufficient qualifications for the centre to open.</p><p>To ensure consistency and further grow practice for children, support is required in:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the assessment and planning of children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>positive guidance strategies to support children's social competence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>knowledge on how to better support priority learners including Māori, children of Pacific heritage, those from other cultures and those with additional learning needs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO identified several areas of non-compliance, some of which have been sufficiently addressed since the onsite stage of this evaluation. A more robust system to monitor health and safety is required, however. There is also a need for all members to actively supervise children at all times, including when children are eating and going to the bathroom.</p><p>Playcentre Aotearoa should continue to build members' knowledge and understanding of new policies and procedures to ensure licensing requirements are upheld.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Arohena Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found a significant area of non-compliance related to:</p><ul>
<li>the supervision of children's eating.<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS22]</em>.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve compliance practice, there is a need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop a consistent approach to positive guidance strategies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to become familiar with processes for referring children with additional needs to external agencies where required.<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C10, C13].</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the on-site phase of the review, members have provided ERO with evidence of action taken to address the following: the lighting and room temperature in the sleep room (PF12, PF35); documentation related to the current Fire Evacuation Scheme approved by New Zealand Fire Service (HS4); there is an updated excursion policy and process [HS17]; regular lockdown drills are carried out and recorded [HS8]; and children have safe independent access to toilet facilities [PF20].</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>Darcy Te Hau</p><p>Acting Director Review and Improvement Services (Central)</p><p>Central Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Pūtahi Nui</span></p><p>3 April 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
