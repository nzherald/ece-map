</table><p>Tui Park Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tui Park Kindergarten is situated in Tawa it provides all-day education and care for up to 40 children. Of the 37 children enrolled, 7 identify as Māori and 6 as Pacific Heritage. Daily sessions are for a mixed-aged group from two years to school age.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy emphasises the importance of Ngā hononga, whānau tangata, kotahitanga and whakamana.</p><p>Since the June 2015 ERO report, a new head teacher has been appointed to manage the day-to-day operation of the kindergarten. All teachers are fully qualified. They represent a range of cultures and backgrounds.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed and managed by He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua Kindergarten Association (the association). A team of senior teachers oversee and support the professional practice of the teaching team. The association governs 102 kindergartens which includes three Pacific kindergartens and a Pacific home-based service with two networks.</p><p>ERO's 2015 report identified areas requiring further development, these included: embedding the assessment and programme planning and strengthening teachers understanding and practices of self review and evaluation. Progress continues to be made in these areas.</p><p>Progress has been made by the association to improve the quality and monitoring of processes to support individual kindergartens and the implementation of a robust appraisal system.</p><p>This review was one of eight in the He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua Kindergarten Association, Wellington region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and whānau wellbeing are a key priority. Leaders and teachers have developed meaningful relationships with community groups, where they provide additional resources and support. Leaders and teachers have established a culture in which children and their whānau are valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are.</p><p>Children learn in a calm and unhurried play-based programme. The outdoor environment includes natural and physical resources that invites exploration and challenge. Teachers effectively use a wide range of intentional teaching strategies to support and extend children's interests. Younger children have many opportunities to learn and play alongside their older peers.</p><p>Cultural diversity is celebrated. Purposeful wall displays and artefacts that acknowledge children of Pacific heritage and other cultures, enrich the learning environment.</p><p>Te ao Māori concepts are valued and celebrated in the programme. Teachers use te reo and waiata Māori in meaningful ways. Whānau expertise in kapa haka is used to further enrich the programme. Leaders and teachers continue to investigate how best they can celebrate places of significant value to Māori and their community in the curriculum.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are consulting with parents, whānau and their Pacific community to determine what educational success means to them and their children.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are identified and effectively planned for in the programme. External support is used, if required.</p><p>Teachers use the association's planning for learning framework well to guide their practice. Planning is based on children’s emerging interests. Intentional teaching strategies are used to enhance meaningful learning experiences.</p><p>Children’s portfolios are a useful record of their participation and developing friendships. Their goals are linked to parent aspirations. An online assessment tool enables whānau to be informed and contribute to their children’s progress and achievement. Leaders have identified the need to continue to strengthen assessment documents by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>showing how intentional teaching strategies are supporting children's progression over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>celebrating children’s cultures, languages and identities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders are improvement focused. They use internal evaluation well to measure the impact of the curriculum on children to support decisions and inform next steps for development. Continuing to build the teaching team’s evaluation capabilities so they can measure the effectiveness of the learning programme on children's learning is a next step.</p><p>A well-considered appraisal process has recently been enhanced to grow and develop teacher practice. Teachers are expected to inquire into the effectiveness of their teaching. Purposeful appraisal goals focus on improving aspects of leadership and practice to support children’s learning and wellbeing.</p><p>The senior teaching team are reflective and highly improvement focused. They successfully foster a collective sense of responsibility to implement the vision, values and mission of the association. Systems and processes have been well developed to guide teachers' capability and positively impact on children’s learning.</p><p>Senior leaders work effectively together, with a shared commitment to meeting strategic goals and objectives for the benefit of children, whānau and community. Well-considered resource allocation supports and enhances children’s learning and wellbeing.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>integrate further aspects of places of value to Māori and the kindergarten's community in the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance assessment for learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to build teachers' evaluation capabilities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO and senior leaders agree that the association's next step is to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to follow the strategic direction set through Tūmanako, Te Tiriti o Waitangi based Strategic Priority Framework.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tui Park Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Southern)</p><p><span>Southern Region - Te Tai Tini</span></p><p>6 March 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
