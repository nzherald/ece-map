</table><p>Roydvale Preschool is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Roydvale Preschool is owned and administered by Kidicorp Education and Care Centres. The centre provides education and care for children from birth to school age in three separate rooms. The preschool and toddlers rooms share an outdoor space. The nursery has its own adjoining outdoor play area. The learning areas are well resourced and presented. Teachers place emphasis on children of all ages having regular opportunities for outdoor play. The centre maintains close links with its local community and the nearby primary school.</p><p>Nearly all staff are qualified and registered early childhood teachers or teachers in training. Staffing is now stable after a number of changes in the Prep School.</p><p>Managers and teachers have made good use of the December 2010 ERO report. They have made significant improvements in the quality of the programme and interactions, child assessment and self review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Babies, toddlers and older children are confident, happy and highly engaged in their learning. Teachers are experienced and knowledgeable about <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the Early Childhood Curriculum. They make good use of this information to provide a well-designed programme for all children, including children with additional learning needs.</p><p>Children in all classrooms actively participate in decisions about their learning and wellbeing. Teachers respect children’s choices, promote their independence and value the skills and knowledge that children bring to the programme.</p><p>Children enjoy high quality learning and teaching experiences that are consistent across the three classrooms. Teachers use a wide range of successful approaches to help children solve problems, and develop and share their ideas with others. This teaching builds upon the strong, caring and supportive relationships that are evident between children and their teachers.</p><p>Children are well supported as they transition into, and within the centre, and on to school. Transition to school is well managed and focuses on children developing independence and self-help skills. Literacy and numeracy learning is well integrated into the programme in the three classrooms.</p><p>Programme planning provides good guidance for teaching and learning. It is closely linked to what teachers know about individual children. It successfully caters for a wide range of children’s interests, skills and abilities.</p><p>Managers and teachers have established strong partnerships with families and whanaū. They regularly seek and respond to parent comments through assessment, planning and self review. They respect families’ home cultures, and bring aspects of their culture into the programme in meaningful ways. Wall displays provide parents with useful information about the programme and children’s learning.</p><p>Kidicorp managers and the centre leaders are providing effective leadership. They successfully involve the teaching team in decision making and future planning for the centre. Teachers work well as a team. Their high expectations for learning and teaching are clearly stated in the centre philosophy and well reflected in the programme.</p><p>The Kidicorp management framework provides clear direction for centre operations. It is well used by the centre managers and teachers to identify where improvements should occur. There are clear links between future planning, organisational and centre self review, staff appraisal and professional development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Kidicorp and centre managers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>more clearly evaluating the outcomes for children, including Māori children, in self review, assessment and programme evaluation</li>
<li>strengthening the ways that teachers include bicultural perspectives in the programme and their interactions.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Roydvale Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Roydvale Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>13 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
