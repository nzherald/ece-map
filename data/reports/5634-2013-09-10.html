</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Conifer Grove Kindergarten is a well established service that provides education and care for children over two years old. Located in Takanini, South Auckland, the service has operated the kindergarten day model since 2010. This enables children to attend sessions that match school hours. The centre is part of the Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association and operates within the policies and management framework of this organisation. A professional practice manager (PPM) visits and provides management and curriculum support for teachers.</p><p>The teaching team reflect the centre&rsquo;s increasingly diverse community. Two staff members have been in the kindergarten for at least eight years. They have worked well with newer staff to form a cohesive, effective team. Of the four teachers, three are fully registered and one is provisionally registered. Teachers regularly participate in professional development opportunities together.</p><p>The 2010 ERO review affirmed good quality teaching that supported children&rsquo;s independent play in a well resourced learning environment. Teachers provided opportunities for children to practise early literacy skills and helped children develop their social competence. Trusting relationships with families were also viewed as a positive feature of the kindergarten. These good practices continue to be evident.</p><p>ERO recommended that teachers improve programme plans and aspects of self review and centre practices, including extending children&rsquo;s learning. In response to these recommendations, teachers have been involved in te reo me ona tikanga M&#257;ori professional development. They have also successfully developed the outdoor environment.</p><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy describes the importance of having a child-sensitive and teacher- facilitated programme and environment where children can develop holistically at their own pace. A focus on engaging with and learning from the kindergarten&rsquo;s community is also highlighted. These features of the philosophy are well reflected in the programme.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident, independent learners. They settle purposefully to different areas of play that are designed to cater for their interests. Some of these areas of play reflect the children&rsquo;s cultural backgrounds. Children communicate well with other children and their teachers. Teachers have developed effective strategies to promote a calm and productive learning tone in the centre. Children with special needs are integrated and supported well by teachers.</p><p>Teachers provide children with opportunities to revisit their learning. Children use their own portfolios to refer to learning stories and to share their learning with others. The curriculum is planned in response to children&rsquo;s interests. Children are encouraged to contribute to group discussions based around their interests. Teachers have developed their communication skills to support children&rsquo;s problem solving and to challenge childrens' thinking.</p><p>The kindergarten benefits from the work of its parent support group. Teachers communicate well with parents about their children's care and learning. Parents are assured that their children&rsquo;s sense of belonging is nurtured during and after transitions into the kindergarten, and when moving to school. These successful transitions are indicative of the good partnerships between families, the kindergarten, and schools.</p><p>The kindergarten acknowledges M&#257;ori as tangata whenua and is committed to Tiriti-based partnerships. Teachers are developing ways to gather and use the aspirations and cultural knowledge of M&#257;ori children&rsquo;s families. Teachers use te reo M&#257;ori in their interactions with children. The environment includes a range of natural materials and cultural artifacts that reflect the diverse cultural backgrounds of children, their families and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>The head teacher has focused on further developing her leadership skills. She supports teachers to reflect on their practice in order to challenge children&rsquo;s learning. Children&rsquo;s progress is evident in assessment folders that contain a series of connected, individual learning stories. The role of the teacher in promoting learning is evident in these learning records.</p><p>The kindergarten is well managed. The systems in place for centre operations, self review and kindergarten association support, contribute to the efficient management of the service. Teachers are guided by their teaching and learning statement, the Association&rsquo;s strategic goals and the centre&rsquo;s annual planning. This promotes sustained development. Teachers use the appraisal process well to identify goals and are encouraged by their PPM to be innovative and reflective in their practices. The current review of the appraisal process at association level will contribute to staff further developing their reflective teaching practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teachers, the PPM and ERO agree that the key next steps for the kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>supporting teachers to display children&rsquo;s interests in order to help children and members of their family contribute more to planned programmes</li>
<li>strengthening teacher confidence in using documented self-review processes to refine their practice</li>
<li>continuing to explore effective ways to consult with parents, wh&#257;nau and aiga.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Conifer Grove Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Conifer Grove Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>10 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/ERO-s-Approach-to-Reviews-in-Early-Childhood-Services-DRAFT-2012"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
