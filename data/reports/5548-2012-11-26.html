<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Lincoln is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens administers 62 kindergartens and one early learning centre in Canterbury and the West Coast. An education services manager (ESM) works with each kindergarten giving feedback and professional support. This kindergarten maintains close relationships with the wider community and the Lincoln primary and secondary schools that are on adjoining sites. All teachers employed by Kidsfirst Kindergartens are fully qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>The kindergarten has a strong commitment to promoting sustainability and an appreciation of the natural world.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in eight kindergartens and one early childhood education services within the Kidsfirst Kindergartens umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Children are actively engaged in a wide range of meaningful learning experiences. Teachers take time to listen, discuss and explore children&rsquo;s interests and wonderings. They make good use of a range of teaching practices to help children to link and understand their learning.</p><p>Children are confident and competent learners. They are well supported by teachers to take care of themselves, each other and the environment.</p><p>Children experience positive and affirming relationships with their teachers. Teachers value parent and wh&#257;nau contributions and successfully use this information to link home and kindergarten learning.</p><p>Teachers use a range of effective strategies to keep parents well informed about kindergarten events and children&rsquo;s interests within the programme.</p><p>The environment promotes sustainability, bicultural understanding and an appreciation of the natural world. Children actively participate in a well-resourced learning environment that provides a wide range of learning experiences. Children have many opportunities to explore and be curious. Teachers work collaboratively and use their individual strengths to extend children&rsquo;s learning in the programme. The kindergarten&rsquo;s vision reflects the teacher and the community aspirations for children&rsquo;s learning and is strongly evident in the programme.</p><p>Under the leadership of the head teacher, the teachers have gained a good understanding of self review and involve parents in the process. Reviews are used effectively to improve what happens for children.</p><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens has a well developed policy and practice framework to support the daily and long-term operation of the kindergarten. The association is kept well informed about the work within the kindergarten. Kidsfirst Kindergartens&rsquo; managers have recently developed a new process for reviewing and reporting kindergarten information. This process is likely to help them further target their support to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The education services manager provides a useful link between the Kidsfirst Kindergartens&rsquo; Association and the teachers. She supports shared leadership, affirms good practice and encourages the team to reflect on their practice.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>ERO identified and the managers agreed that it is time to:</p><ul>
<li>review the large group time to ensure it promotes the learning of all children</li>
<li>strengthen teachers' analysis of children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>ensure appraisal goals continue to challenge teachers&rsquo; practices to improve the learning outcomes of all children.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Lincoln completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>26 November 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
