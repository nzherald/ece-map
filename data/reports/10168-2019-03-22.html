</table><p>Vintage Kids is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Vintage Kids is a well-established childcare centre in Epsom, Auckland. It is licensed for 26 children, including up to five under two years of age. The centre operates in a renovated bungalow in a residential neighbourhood. Vintage Kids offers full-day education and care in a mixed-age programme. Children come from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds and many speak more than one language.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is founded in children growing their creativity through storytelling. It emphasises children becoming creative, confident, curious, caring and communicative learners (the 5C's). This is underpinned by a commitment to biculturalism. Leaders and teachers value learning through play in a natural, home-like environment that inspires children's imagination.</p><p>This centre is one of two centres owned by an experienced early childhood operator. A head teacher provides leadership across both centres. At this centre a team leader works alongside three other qualified teachers. The cultures of the families are reflected in the teaching team.</p><p>The positive features identified in the 2015 ERO report have been maintained. These include children having a sense of belonging, a family-like environment, and good strategic management. Key next steps included continuing to refine assessment, programme planning and evaluation, responding to children’s individual learning dispositions in planning, and increasing the inclusion of the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The centre has made progress in some of these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s wellbeing is nurtured through positive, respectful relationships and strong connections with teachers and peers. Children are warmly welcomed by staff on arrival. The centre's calm and positive tone helps them settle quickly. Children show a strong sense of belonging to the centre.</p><p>Teachers provide nurturing and respectful care for infants and toddlers. Children benefit from a primary caregiving system that allows their individual preferences and care routines to be met. Infants are supported to develop independence and confidently explore suitable resources that are easily accessible to them. Teachers respond to infants' early attempts to communicate, and encourage children to engage in conversations.</p><p>Children are friendly, articulate and confident learners. They play cooperatively with and alongside their peers for sustained periods of time and benefit from playing in mixed-age groups. Teachers sensitively move in and out of children’s play, skilfully supporting children to develop social competencies, build strong friendships and learn independence. They provide good quality resources and learning environments that enable children to explore, experience challenges, and enjoy creative and imaginative play.</p><p>Leaders and teachers know their children and whānau well. Children's cultural backgrounds and knowledge are valued. Their home languages are incorporated into interactions with teachers to support their learning. Tikanga and te reo Māori are integrated into the centre's daily routines. Children are encouraged to support each other in tuakana/teina relationships, particularly with children under two years of age. Waiata, myths and legends bring a te ao Māori perspective to the storytelling programme. There is an ongoing commitment to biculturalism within the centre.</p><p>Teachers and leaders collaboratively enact a shared philosophy for children's learning based on the 5C's. They regularly review programme planning and processes to establish deeper understandings of what the philosophy looks like in action. Aligning programme planning with <em>Te Whāriki</em> would allow them to develop a more individualised, richer curriculum for each child in partnership with whānau.</p><p>Teachers maintain portfolios of learning that record children's participation in the programme. They regularly observe children and plan activities based on the interests of groups of children. Teachers should now focus on making these learning records more individualised.</p><p>The centre is managed effectively. Leaders work collaboratively with staff to build shared understandings and effect change across centres. They provide good opportunities for staff growth through well targeted internal and external professional development. Leaders are beginning to foster emergent leadership opportunities for staff. The teacher appraisal process is currently under review.</p><p>Centre leaders work collaboratively to provide quality outcomes for children. The philosophy and vision have been developed to guide the centre's direction. Sound policy frameworks and systems are in place for the efficient management of the centre. The strategic goals guide the centre's direction and link to the annual plan. Internal evaluation is aligned to the philosophy and contributes to improved learning outcomes for the children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop programme planning processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a process for programme evaluation to show deeper engagement with <em>Te Whāriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening risk management processes for centre excursions.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Vintage Kids completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>22 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> <i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
