</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Mount Community Kindy is located in Mount Maunganui, near the local shopping centre. The centre is licensed for 40 children, and provides sessional and all day care for children in a mixed-age setting from two years to school age. At the time of the ERO review there were 66 children including five who are identified as Māori.</p><p>The centre operates under the governance umbrella of Kidicorp Ltd. The Hamilton regional office of Kidicorp Ltd was established in 2012 and provides strong and effective governance, leadership and management support underpinned by Kidicorp’s clear vision and values. There are well-developed and rigorous self review and quality assurance processes along with professional, administrative and business support by well-qualified and experienced personnel.</p><p>A new professional services manager has been appointed and is providing valuable support and guidance for the centre manager, head teacher and teaching team. Since the 2011 ERO review, the centre has made good progress in improving the areas for development related to strengthening assessment, and planning and reviewing centre routines. Teachers have implemented an electronic portfolio system, and a shared planning process that is more effectively guiding the centre-wide programme. Routines are more flexible and responsive to children’s learning and care needs and are contributing to a relaxed learning environment for teachers and children.</p><p>The centre philosophy has recently been reviewed and gives priority to:</p><ul>
<li>an environment, which is safe, happy, fun and stimulating for children to explore</li>
<li>opportunities for children to learn early concepts of literacy and numeracy</li>
<li>valuing and learning about te reo and tikanga Māori as well as different cultures</li>
<li>working in partnership with parents and community to provide positive and responsive care and education for children.</li>
</ul><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre manager is providing strong and effective leadership for centre operations. She is well respected by the team and wider community. Her open, shared leadership style has established and maintained a cohesive and collaborative team who have been together for many years. The head teacher works supportively with the centre manager and teachers to ensure the smooth day-to-day running of the centre. The professional services manager has supported centre leaders to provide more specific and reflective feedback to teachers about their practice. This good practice could now be extended to all teachers on the team in a documented form that allows teachers to reflect on and make progress with their practice.</p><p>Children enjoy a rich programme that offers wide experiences and links with the local community. They explore and experiment with a wide range of good quality equipment and materials. Teachers have created interesting learning spaces in a multi-levelled environment that stimulates children’s imaginations and sense of adventure.</p><p>Children are able to make choices, sustain their play, and self manage their learning. Teachers encourage children to take leadership roles through dramatic play with their friends. Mathematics and literacy are highly evident in the programme. Children make frequent use of books for research, enjoyment and to extend their learning. There are many opportunities for children to express themselves through writing, drawing and creative experiences. Natural science is evident in the programme and children explore natural resources, care for animals, and participate in gardening activities. Transitions and routines are well planned and respond to the care and learning needs of children and teachers. These experiences are captured in individual profile books that are treasured by families and children.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate consistent and high-quality teaching practice. They have established strong and meaningful relationships with families. Strengths of this teaching team are:</p><ul>
<li>following children’s interests and adding complexity to their learning through play</li>
<li>recognising and responding to opportunities to engage in, and extend, children’s thinking through intentional planning and teaching practice</li>
<li>having regular learning conversations that foster children’s language development and thinking skills</li>
<li>fostering and encouraging children’s leadership</li>
<li>sharing their love and enjoyment of learning, laughter and fun.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have established relationships with the local schools in the community that promote children’s positive transition to school. They work cooperatively with specialist agencies to implement programmes and activities for children with identified needs.</p><p>Teachers have a strong commitment to integrating te reo and tikanga Māori within the programme. Children enjoy sharing karakia, waiata,and te reo Māori with their teachers. The centre environment and equipment strongly reflect the value placed on Māori culture. The relationship with one child’s whānau has led to teachers, children and their families being welcomed on to Tahuwhakatiki Marae. The ethnic groups of children are recognised and included to enhance the programme.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that key next steps for improvement are:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing the presentation of children’s individual portfolios and considering ways to more strongly acknowledge children’s culture, language , identity and learning pathways in these documents</li>
<li>ongoing professional development for teachers to continue to build their knowledge of mathematics in the early childhood setting.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Community Kindy The Mount completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Community Kindy The Mount will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>4 December 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
