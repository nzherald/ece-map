</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiwi Clubhouse Learning Centre, located in Hawera, has children aged from six months to five years. It is an all-day centre licensed for 50 children, including 15 aged up to two years. Of the 65 children enrolled, 18 identify as Māori.</p><p>The centre is a non-profit, community-based service governed by a parent committee. The identified priorities for learners are: independence; resilience; self-regulation; communication; trust; respect and curiosity. This informs the delivery of the curriculum.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor environments provide opportunities for exploration and collaborative play for infants, toddlers and young children.</p><p>Since the July 2016 ERO report, two new team leaders have been appointed to support the centre manager. They are responsible for the delivery of the curriculum in the Tui room which caters for older children, and the Kea and Morepork rooms for infants and toddlers.</p><p>Priorities for improvement identified in the previous ERO review have been sufficiently addressed. Systems and processes to improve the strategic direction of the service and growing teacher practices have been implemented. Policies and procedures to improve the employment practices have been updated. The Ministry of Education has supported ongoing professional learning and development to support governance and leadership. The appraisal system aligns to teacher goals and centre-wide operation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy is highly evident in practice and aligns to the service's identified priorities for learners. Respectful relationships between teachers, children and whānau promote a sense of belonging. The service has effectively engaged with Māori expertise to grow their understanding of Tiriti based practices.</p><p>Teachers have deepened their knowledge of children's whakapapa to enrich learning experiences for Māori children. Te ao Māori concepts such as tikanga, waiata and the meaningful use of te reo Māori are woven through the programme. Leaders and teachers have identified that this continues to be an ongoing focus. ERO's evaluation confirms this direction.</p><p>Children actively explore within a richly resourced setting that promotes independence. They are engaged in play and demonstrate confidence as they competently navigate the environment alongside their peers. Teachers and children participate in meaningful conversations with each other.</p><p>A calm settled environment promotes infants' and toddlers' sense of wellbeing. Teachers are responsive to their non-verbal cues. They provide a wide range of literacy experiences, music and open-ended resources to effectively support early language development.</p><p>In partnership with parents, external agencies are accessed as required, to effectively support children with diverse learning needs. Consistent teaching practices are collaboratively developed and provide good support for children as they transition within the service and move on to school.</p><p>The planning, assessment and evaluation process successfully aligns to the centre's intended priorities for learning and <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Children's emerging interests, together with parent contributions, are promoted through intentional teaching strategies. To further strengthen the process, consideration should be given to individual learning assessment, informed by children's individual strengths, passions, culture, language and identity.</p><p>An ongoing cycle of self review is focused on improving outcomes for children. Leaders and teachers continue to build their evaluative capability. A key next is to develop a more robust internal evaluation framework that clearly articulates the service's expectations and builds teachers' capability to make decisions based on evaluative findings.</p><p>Teachers successfully engage in an inquiry approach to teaching that shows positive changes to children's learning. To strengthen the appraisal process, a key next step is to develop a clearly articulated procedure to guide practice. Leaders should continue to build their capability to effectively support teachers' professional learning.</p><p>The board and leaders have made significant progress in response to strengthening policies and procedures to guide the service's operation. They work collaboratively to monitor ongoing improvements and improve learning outcomes for children. Leaders identify that continuing to build sustainable practices through ongoing professional learning and support for the centre manager and team leaders remains a priority. ERO's evaluation confirms this direction.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>All areas of non-compliance from the previous review have been appropriately addressed. The service has taken a well-considered approach to improve systems, policies and procedures. Leaders recognise that some areas require strengthening. To further improve practice, the service should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen planning, assessment and evaluation for each child so that it is responsive to individual learning and informed by emerging interests, culture, language and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop an appraisal procedure to provide clearer expectations and guidance for teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to improve understanding and use of self review and internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen partnerships with whānau Māori and the community to promote successful learning outcomes for Maori children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen leadership capability to promote sustainable practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiwi Clubhouse Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice, leaders and teachers should insure that parents acknowledge that their children have been administered medicine.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kiwi Clubhouse Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>18 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
