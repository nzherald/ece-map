</table><p>Tino E Tasi Preschool is well placed to promote the culture, language and identity of Samoan children. However the preschool requires further development of its governance, management, leadership and curriculum practices to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tino E Tasi Preschool is a privately owned, bilingual Pacific centre. It has a strong focus on supporting Samoan families and promoting the Samoan culture and language.</p><p>The Ministry of Education closed the preschool at the beginning of 2012 as it was unable to meet its legal requirements. The centre reopened in April 2012 on a provisional licence.</p><p>The centre has received ongoing support from the Ministry of Education and external professional advice and guidance to help the owner meet the 2008 regulations for early childhood education services. The preschool was fully licensed, under these regulations, in March 2014.</p><p>Many of the staff are new to the centre in 2014. The centre’s leadership model and accompanying roles and responsibilities for managers and staff have yet to be clearly defined.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The language, culture and identity of Samoan children are strongly supported by dedicated centre staff. Teachers warmly welcome children and parents. They actively foster positive relationships and ensure that interactions with fanau are culturally responsive. Parent views are sought and valued to help staff support children’s culture, language and wellbeing. Staff have identified that a next step is to communicate and work more collaboratively with parents and relevant agencies to better support children with special education needs.</p><p>The teaching team has a shared vision and belief in making a difference for children. It would now be useful to ensure that this vision is well reflected in the centre’s philosophy statement. Consideration should also be given to making expectations for bicultural practices more evident in the centre’s vision, philosophy and other key guiding documents.</p><p>Children are happy and settled. They benefit from caring, affirming and fun interactions with staff, who work well together to promote children’s individual and group interests. The needs of infants and toddlers are well supported by nurturing adult-child relationships that promote children’s positive sense of self. Excursions into the local community provide meaningful experiences for children.</p><p>Some staff use te reo and tikanga Māori in conversations with children. Strengthening this practice to include all staff would help children to develop a greater understanding of the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p><p>While the fostering of Samoan culture and language and children’s wellbeing is strong, curriculum planning and implementation is an area in need of continuing development. Better use of<em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, is needed to help staff improve planning for, and documenting of, children’s learning. Provision of appropriate and good quality resources and a focus on improving the environment is also required to support the teaching and learning programme.</p><p>Some staff are beginning to make good use of self-review. However the ongoing strengthening of self review practices is required to help the owner and staff identify where changes should be made to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Centre governance and management systems continue to develop with assistance from external advisors and the use of learning gained from participation in professional development. A next step is to personalise strategic and annual action planning to the centre to help ensure this planning is well matched to the priorities of the centre and its community. New teacher appraisal and registration processes should be further developed and fully implemented</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to improve teaching and learning for children, the owner and staff should give priority to:</p><ul>
<li>defining and implementing a clear leadership model</li>
<li>developing more useful strategic and annual planning</li>
<li>implementing appropriate performance management and teacher registration processes</li>
<li>refining and strengthening programme planning and documentation</li>
<li>further strengthening self-review practices to help the owner and staff better evaluate the impact of teaching practices on learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tino E Tasi Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to police vetting, excursions, earthquake drills, hazards, and reporting on the use of equity funding. To meet requirements the service needs to ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>all non-registered staff are police vetted prior to commencing employment and that this vetting process is revisited on a regular basis</li>
<li>regular earthquake drills are implemented and documented</li>
<li>potential hazards are eliminated, isolated or made inaccessible to children and heavy furniture and equipment is secured to minimise falling object hazards</li>
<li>equity funding reporting requirements are met.<br>[<em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008; GMA3, GMA7, HS 6, HS 8 ].</em></li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tino E Tasi Preschool will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>30 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
