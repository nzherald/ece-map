</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Montessori Milestones Preschool is a small centre located in the suburb of Papamoa, Tauranga. The centre is licensed for 20 children over the age of two who may attend from 8.30am to 2.30pm each day. The current roll is 11 children, three of whom are Māori.</p><p>The centre is owned and operated by two experienced and knowledgeable professional leaders. Recently two new teachers have been appointed, which has provided a good balance between experienced and new staff members.</p><p>Centre leaders have responded positively to the areas for review and development identified in the 2012 ERO review. They have provided more opportunities for children to extend their physical skills in the outdoor environment and are developing a strong process for strategic planning and annual planning.</p><p>The centre curriculum is strongly based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and is implemented and enhanced through the Montessori philosophy and methodology. The centre philosophy focuses on respect for self, others and the environment, self discipline, a non-competitive atmosphere, and the uniqueness of each child.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience caring, warm relationships with their teachers and one another. Families and whānau are welcomed into the centre and encouraged to be active participants in their children’s learning. In keeping with the Montessori philosophy, children demonstrate independence, empathy and respect for themselves and each other.</p><p>The centre environment is warm, bright and cheerful. In keeping with the Montessori philosophy, the environment is uncluttered and there is a wide range of activities available for children. These activities are carefully sequenced to provide increasing complexity and promote a range of skills for learning. Children have a strong sense of belonging and ownership within the centre environment. They access the resources and equipment confidently and independently.</p><p>Teachers use Montessori teaching strategies that include:</p><ul>
<li>observing children for sustained periods of time and minimising interruptions to children’s play</li>
<li>supporting children to lead and direct their own learning</li>
<li>modelling and demonstrating correct ways to use equipment and resources.</li>
</ul><p>These strategies promote thinking, independence and self-management skills.</p><p>A strong emphasis on the Montessori curriculum includes:</p><ul>
<li>practical life skills for self management</li>
<li>sensorial experiences that promote fine motor control and coordination</li>
<li>a strong emphasis on literacy and mathematics</li>
<li>grace and courtesy that promote social competency</li>
<li>music, geography and science.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have an understanding of the child as a unique learner. They plan and assess for individual children along with identifying current learning and possible next learning steps. Teachers focus on enhancing dispositional learning and skills, and developing children’s working theories. Children and parents have access to individual assessment portfolios, which contain a record of children’s learning and growth during their time in preschool. Parents are meaningfully involved in their children’s learning. Teachers prepare individual summaries of learning and progress each term and then discuss with parents their child’s learning goals for the term coming.</p><p>Leaders have strengthened the links between centre strategic goals and teacher professional practice. Teachers set goals to improve their teaching that are linked to the strategic goals of the centre. A process of ‘teaching as inquiry’ has been introduced to help teachers reflect deeply about the effectiveness of their teaching practice in relation to their goals, thereby promoting continual improvement in practice.</p><p>New teachers report that they have been well supported during their induction. Centre leaders have participated in many opportunities for ongoing professional development.</p><p>Leaders have developed relationships with parents based on respect and trust. They encourage parents, families and whānau to be actively involved in aspects of centre decision making.</p><p>Ongoing self review leads to improvements in teaching and learning and in centre operations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders discussed the progress made in relation to strategic planning and self review. A next step is to ensure that there is greater clarity in documentation so that staff are able to understand and embed the processes in everyday practice.</p><p>Centre leaders acknowledge that they have taken some initial steps to embedding the language and culture of their Māori children and whānau. Next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>increase the use of te reo Māori throughout the centre</li>
<li>develop meaningful relationships with local iwi</li>
<li>take a more systematic approach to learning about local Māori history.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Montessori Milestones Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Montessori Milestones Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>2 July 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
