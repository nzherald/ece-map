<a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Paengaroa Free Kindergarten governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the October 2011 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>the quality of relationships among the staff, children and the community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the quality of teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strategic planning and self review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>matters relating to health and safety.</p>
</li>
</ol><a id="2-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Paengaroa Free Kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Tauranga Regional Free Kindergarten Association. It is situated near Te Puke in the rural village of Paengaroa. The kindergarten is adjacent to the local primary school, and serves families from the local rural community. Currently 37 children are attending, of whom 12 are identified as Māori.</p><p>Respectful and trusting relationships are evident among teachers, parents and children. Since the previous ERO review the kindergarten has changed its opening hours, and now provides all day sessions, with younger children leaving at 12.30 pm. This change has helped to develop a more unified and cooperative social climate for children, parents and teachers.</p><p>The head teacher models highly effective teaching, and supports the inclusive teaching team to recognise and respond to children’s interests and challenge their thinking. Teachers reflect on their teaching practice and are continuing to refine their skills. Parents are well-informed about their children’s learning through individual profiles, conversations, and meetings with teachers.</p><p>A more strategic approach to self review is enabling the kindergarten committee to work alongside teachers to make appropriate improvements to the kindergarten environment and operation. They have been assisted by the association and continue to receive effective support from the association senior teacher.</p><p>Teachers have appropriate systems to identify hazards in the kindergarten and on trips. The association should continue to support the head teacher to ensure that health and safety practices and teacher appraisal are carried out in a systematic and timely way.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle</p><a id="3-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Findings</h2><p>Background</p><p>The 2011 ERO review identified areas of concern about aspects of centre operations, including relationship issues among staff, the community and children. The teachers, with the support of the association needed to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>formulate strategic and annual plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the hours of opening, organised as two 4-hour programmes daily, with separate groups of children attending during morning or afternoon session</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and implement processes to guide teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen personnel management to support effective teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement robust quality assurance practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>It was considered that these proposals were likely to develop cohesive partnerships among teachers, children and their families.</p><p>There was an action required to address the management of hazards about the safety of children, and the management of risks for outings or excursions.</p><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>The kindergarten, with the support of the association, has responded positively and purposefully to the key findings of the previous ERO report. Following extensive consultation with the community and teachers, the association changed the hours of operation to introduce a school day model. Currently the kindergarten opens from 8.30 am to 2.30 pm, with a maximum of 30 children attending. Ten of this group leave at 12.30 pm. The change has contributed to improvements in communication among teachers, and enabled them to work as a cohesive team focused on responding to children’s learning needs and parents’ aspirations. The kindergarten continues to receive effective support from the association senior teacher.</p><p>The head teacher models highly effective teaching and encourages teachers to reflect on their practice. Teachers work alongside children, holding extended conversations that introduce problem solving, add depth of understanding, and promote and sustain play. Teachers are continuing to build up their ways of recognising and recording learning so they are responsive to children’s ideas, strengths and abilities, and also include their parents’ aspirations. Portfolios provide a continuing record of children’s participation in the programme and ongoing learning. Aspects of literacy, mathematics and sustainable use of the environment are integrated meaningfully into the programme. Increased application of these ideas is evident in children’s play. Children with additional learning needs are included as valuable members of the kindergarten community, and their learning is well supported. A knowledgeable community member is providing regular support for teachers and children to use te reo Māori as a natural part of the programme.</p><p>The association, teachers and the kindergarten committee have established a more strategic approach to improving the kindergarten environment and operation. Teachers and parents, supported by the association, have focused on improvements to the indoor and outdoor environments. Children are highly engaged in exploring the well-presented learning areas. The playground is spacious and reflects the New Zealand natural world. Children have participated alongside adults in constructing key features using local rocks and plants. The indoor area has been refurbished, is resourced with high-quality materials and equipment, and includes the use of information and communication technologies (ICT). Teachers ensure that the learning areas invite parents to sit alongside their children to observe and participate in their play and learning.</p><p>Teachers have been involved in ongoing professional development. They have participated in:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>an externally led research project on outdoor learning</p>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<p>a self-review programme that extended teachers’ up-to-date knowledge of literacy learning and teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an external review of te reo and tikanga Māori practices in the kindergarten, arranged by the association to support their ongoing bicultural journey.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These experiences have supported the growth of a collegial team, and a culture of increasing reflection and professional inquiry. Teachers are committed to strengthening relationships with the local iwi, and are developing their confidence with te reo and tikanga Māori. The kindergarten has identified, and ERO agrees, that these are priority areas for continuing development.</p><p>The teaching team has made a good beginning at implementing association expectations effectively. Teachers now have appropriate systems to identify hazards and manage risks on trips and excursions.</p><p>The association should give priority to supporting the head teacher to fulfil the expectations for quality assurance, teacher appraisal and health and safety practices in a systematic and timely way.</p><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>4 Future Action</span></h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>08 April 2013</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

Teachers reflect on their teaching practice and are continuing to refine their skills. Parents are well-informed about their children’s learning through individual profiles, conversations, and meetings with teachers.</p><p>A more strategic approach to self review is enabling the kindergarten committee to work alongside teachers to make appropriate improvements to the kindergarten environment and operation. They have been assisted by the association and continue to receive effective support from the association senior teacher.</p><p>Teachers have appropriate systems to identify hazards in the kindergarten and on trips. The association should continue to support the head teacher to ensure that health and safety practices and teacher appraisal are carried out in a systematic and timely way.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow-up action they plan to do. You should talk to the management or licensee if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p>
