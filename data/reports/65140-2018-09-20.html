</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hira Rural Kindergarten is part of the Nelson Tasman Kindergarten Association (NTKA). It is located in Wakapuaka, a semi-rural area close to Nelson city. The kindergarten provides for the education and care of up to 36 children, aged from two-to-five years. The association offers up to 30 free hours to support children's participation in early childhood education. It also provides a range of external expertise to help all children succeed in their learning. This includes te ao Māori expertise, teacher aides, a speech-language therapist, whānau support and parent- education opportunities.</p><p>All teachers are fully qualified. Teacher aides provide support for the children and teachers to help meet identified areas of need. An active parent committee leads fundraising initiatives to support ongoing resourcing, special outings and improvements to the kindergarten. The kindergarten is part the Enviroschools' initiative and has achieved a silver award.</p><p>The NTKA, including a Chief Executive Officer and board, is responsible for the governance of the kindergarten. A team of senior education advisors (SEA) oversees and supports the professional practice of the teaching team.</p><p>The kindergarten has made steady progress with the recommendations identified in ERO’s 2013 report. This includes improved appraisal and internal evaluation practices, developing understandings of te ao Māori and implementing a bicultural curriculum. Assessment, planning and evaluation processes and practices remain areas to improve.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the NTKA.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten's vision, emphasising the importance of nurturing partnerships, children and the natural world is strongly evident in practice. Environmentally sustainable practices are integrated into the programme.</p><p>This vision is supported by a philosophy of shared beliefs and caring ways of working with children. The following valued learning outcomes are evident in the ways teachers:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>foster respectful relationships and kindness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encourage friendships and social skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>involve children in creativity, literacy, science, numeracy and technology learning experiences.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers develop strong partnerships with parents, whānau and the community to support children's sense of wellbeing and belonging. Transitions into the kindergarten and onto school are personalised to meet the needs of each family. The contributions and involvement of parents, whānau and community enrich the curriculum provided for children.</p><p>The home language, culture and identity of children and families are acknowledged, respected and celebrated. Children have many opportunities to learn about bicultural practices and te ao Māori in ways that are meaningful to them and respectful of Māori culture.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well supported through sensitive interactions within an inclusive learning environment. Teachers work collaboratively with parents, and external agencies when required, to develop an individualised approach to children's learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Children benefit from a child-centred curriculum that is responsive to their interests, strengths and capabilities. Records of learning show children's involvement in a wide range of rich experiences that foster imagination and learning through play.</p><p>The head teacher is building teaching and leadership capacity. Teachers make good use of appraisal processes, reflective practice, internal evaluation and professional development to continually grow their practice, and provide positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Managers and leaders have proactively addressed ERO’s recommendations for the association, identified in previous ERO reports. There is strong alignment between the NTKA strategic priorities and each kindergarten’s priorities and plans.</p><p>The board is well informed about outcomes from association-wide strategic reviews and the progress being made to achieve strategic goals. The board and association managers are taking deliberate action to support Māori and Pacific children and children with diverse learning needs. NTKA leaders have developed strong, networked relationships with community organisations to support children and their whānau.</p><p>There are effective systems and processes to ensure that regulatory requirements are met. Relevant professional learning opportunities, improved teacher appraisal processes and effective ongoing coaching and mentoring by the education advisors are building leadership and teacher capability within the kindergartens.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>A next step for association leaders and managers is to improve planning to support the achievement of the board’s strategic objectives. This includes ensuring that reporting is evaluative and focuses on outcomes for children.</p><p>The key next steps for the board are to:</p><ul>
<li>explore ways to know more about how well children are achieving in relation to the association’s valued outcomes (vision and philosophy)</li>
<li>evaluate the extent of improved outcomes for all children and use these findings to inform decision making and the future direction of the association.</li>
</ul><p>The key next steps for Hira Rural Kindergarten are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>fully implement Te Whāriki (2017) the early childhood curriculum, to further develop assessment, planning and evaluation processes that are focused on valued learning outcomes for children and intentional teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve the focus on outcomes for children within annual planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen internal evaluation processes to include the evaluation of outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hira Rural Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hira Rural Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>20 September 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 633px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
