</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sunshine Childcare Preschool is a privately owned full-day education and care service located in the industrial area of Te Rapa in Hamilton city. The centre is licensed for 126 children, including 40 up to the age of two. At the time of this ERO review the centre’s roll of 117 children, included 36 who identified as Māori. The centre is one of two in Hamilton owned by the same company. It operates five age-based rooms, two of which share the same outdoor play area. Each room is led by a separate team leader.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review there has been a change of ownership of the centre and significant changes to the leadership and teaching teams. During 2013 the new owners established a separate room to better provide for babies and young toddlers. They also undertook extensive development of the outdoor play areas. In May 2014 a centre manager was appointed to provide overall professional and administrative leadership of the centre.</p><p>The vision of the centre owners is to provide a centre that promotes children’s engagement, wonder and imagination.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Sunshine Childcare Preschool (45290) is well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Children benefit from participating in a programme that provides many opportunities for them to follow their own interests. They experience caring and respectful relationships with their teachers. Children explore and experience safe physical challenge in the spacious outdoor play spaces.</p><p>Teachers implement effective strategies that support the development of children’s social skills and contribute to the centre’s settled atmosphere for learning. They are committed to their ongoing professional learning and regularly reflect on their teaching practice. ERO observed examples of effective teaching practices that promote children’s thinking and problem solving skills. These practices supported children to participate in meaningful sustained play, both individually and in small groups.</p><p>Babies and young toddlers have opportunities to explore in a safe and uncluttered learning environment. Each baby enjoys consistent care from a primary carer who works in close partnership with the parents. Nurturing relationships are established with these young children and teachers effectively use care routines as an important learning opportunity.</p><p>Children nearing school age participate in a programme that is a combination of teacher-led and child-initiated activities. This programme places emphasis on school readiness and literacy development. The centre is developing an appropriate range of resources and equipment, however teachers need to give consideration to how these resources are presented and made accessible to children. ERO observed examples of teachers using effective teaching strategies that engage children in meaningful play and learning. Priority should be given to embedding these effective strategies consistently throughout the centre.</p><p>Teachers have undertaken professional learning to further develop and include a bicultural perspective in the centre’s operations. They include celebrations of significant Māori events such as matariki in the programme. Māori tamariki’s sense of identity and belonging is supported by the increasing use of te reo Māori by teachers, daily karakia and waiata.</p><p>Other positive features of the programme experienced by children include:</p><ul>
<li>trips to places of interest in the local and wider community</li>
<li>many opportunities for parents and community members to share their skills and knowledge with children</li>
<li>natural integration of literacy and mathematics into children’s play and learning</li>
<li>many opportunities for children to develop independent, self-care skills</li>
<li>implementing flexible meal and routine times to maximise opportunities for children to sustain their play.</li>
</ul><p>Parents are well informed about their children’s participation in the programme through access to well-presented and informative individual learning portfolios.</p><p>The centre owners have a strong focus on providing a quality education and care service by building leadership and teacher capability. They have accessed external professional development for teachers to enhance the centre’s bicultural dimension. A useful self-review process has been implemented to support centre development. With the support of an external advisor the owners have developed an appropriate policy framework to guide centre operations. The recently appointed centre manager is knowledgeable about effective practice in early childhood education. She is establishing positive professional partnerships with the owners and team leaders. She is also committed to implementing the owners’ vision and strategic direction for the centre, which is to provide quality education and care for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the centre owners and manager agree that the key next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop with teachers and team leaders shared expectations for effective leadership and teaching practices at the centre</li>
<li>provide centre wide professional development for teachers to support them to implement these expectations and the provision of regular feedback to teachers about the effectiveness of their teaching.</li>
<li>review the provision, accessibility and presentation of centre resources and equipment to ensure that children have ready access to high quality learning materials.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sunshine Childcare Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Sunshine Childcare Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>15 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
