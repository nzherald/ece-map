</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central City Quality Edu-care (Pukaki St) is one of two privately owned Education and Care services in central Rotorua. The owner director is also the licensee. She is a fully qualified ECE teacher and works directly with the staff, children and parents. She employs two supervisors to oversee the daily running of the centres and they report directly to her.</p><p>Pukaki Street operates on Monday to Friday from 7.30 am until 5.30 pm and is licensed for a maximum of 35 children, including up to 8 under two years of age. Currently 36 children attend the centre and 12 are of Māori descent. It has a culturally diverse roll and teaching team. The teaching team is well qualified and have remained constant with only a small number of changes since the last ERO review in 2013. This has resulted in a strong team culture and close and positive relationships with families and children.</p><p>The centre operates a mixed-aged approach where all age groups interact, learn and play together. The centre philosophy encourages children to develop and explore at their own pace through a variety of activities and play-based learning opportunities. The centre aims to create a warm and secure environment that fosters self-confidence and encourages social skill development. Relationships are seen as the key in enhancing children's learning outcomes with strong connections between the centre, children, home environment and extended whānau.</p><p>The centre has made good progress in addressing the recommendations from the previous ERO report in 2013. Self review has been strengthened by encouraging staff to take leadership responsibility in identifying areas for review, and this is leading to continuous improvement in learning opportunities for children, and enhanced teaching practice.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children feel included and enjoy trusting relationships with teachers and each other. They demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and a willingness to share their ideas and interests. The challenging but safe environment is well prepared to provide a rich variety of experiences. Children play and explore in both the indoor and outdoor areas using their imagination and creativity in pursuing their interests. Oral language, literacy, mathematics, science and nature are naturally integrated into the programme.</p><p>A feature of the programme is a mixed-age approach where children of all ages are able to interact and play with each other in all parts of the centre. The environment promotes children's safety, physical and emotional wellbeing, intellectual stimulation and effectively supports very young children. Infants and toddlers receive responsive caregiving which helps their needs for strong and secure attachments. Older children demonstrate responsible attitudes and care for younger children.</p><p>Children learn through play and are encouraged to follow their interests, solve problems and take responsible risks by teachers who know them well. Teachers spend time with children supporting their engagement in self-initiated play. They notice, recognise and respond intentionally to extend learning opportunities for children. Open-ended questions are used to prompt children's thinking. Children are developing independence and are being encouraged to take increasing responsibility for their own learning and wellbeing. Teachers are particularly skilled in helping children with additional learning needs. They work with parents and external agencies to identify areas for development and share useful skills and approaches in supporting these children.</p><p>All children and their families are welcomed into the centre. Children are understood as unique learners, and accepted and celebrated for who they are. Teachers are culturally responsive and promote the identity and culture of each child. Te reo Māori, tikanga and bicultural practices are integrated into the programme in authentic contexts. All parents interviewed by ERO were pleased with the way the individuality and identity of their children's culture are celebrated and fostered.</p><p>Programme planning uses ideas from children's individual interests as well as a balance of group interests, which respond to children's fascination with a chosen topic. An important part of planning is the knowledge that children bring with them to the centre and share with others. Children's interests, learning and progress are recorded in attractive individual portfolio books and they enjoy reading and sharing these books.</p><p>Children benefit from effective transition procedures to support them on entering the centre or on entry to school. Procedures include visits, liaison with schools, sharing of information and support for parents. A transition programme operates for older children who choose to be involved and this provides a fun and interesting way of developing skills and knowledge that is likely to benefit them on school entry. Children demonstrate high levels of enthusiasm and interest in this programme.</p><p>The knowledgeable and experienced director and head teacher provide strong collaborative leadership for the teaching team. They empower teachers to use their strengths and interests to take on leadership roles. The team shares a commitment to beliefs and values about children's learning and wellbeing. Teachers are reflective practitioners who use self review to continually enhance their teaching practice.</p><p>Teachers have been involved in effective professional development and learning that has promoted enthusiasm, and increased their confidence and engagement in learning and teaching. Currently teachers are working on two main areas identified through self-review. These relate to enhancing the links between centre and home thereby creating a more holistic learning environment, and encouraging communication through enhanced displays of planning and learning stories.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Senior Management and ERO agreed that it would be timely to:</p><ul>
<li>review strategic planning to manage ongoing changes and identify goals for future centre development</li>
<li>continue developing effective appraisal systems for both teaching and non-teaching staff.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central City Quality Edu-care (Pukaki St) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)<br>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)<br>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)<br>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4><b>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</b></h4><p>The next ERO review of Central City Quality Edu-care (Pukaki St) will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>31 March 2016</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><div>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
