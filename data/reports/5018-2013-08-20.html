</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Parihaka Kindergarten is one of 21 kindergartens that operate under the governance of the Northland Kindergarten Association. The kindergarten is situated in a residential area and recently had a name change from Riverside to Parihaka to reflect the kindergarten’s place within the Whangarei community. The kindergarten has also recently changed the hours children may attend by providing full day sessions. Families are able to select the days they wish children to attend. Some children continue to attend morning sessions only.</p><p>Teachers’ practices are monitored and supported by a number of association personnel, including a Māori Pou Whakarewa Tikanga who has supported teachers to strengthen their bicultural practices with children. An association speech language therapist also supports children and teachers. The Association provides a framework of policies and procedures that are reviewed and updated on a regular basis. Regular visits and reports from the professional practice manager affirm teachers’ work and identify improvements they should consider.</p><p>ERO’s 2010 report commended the warm, welcoming and thoughtful environment provided for children and families. It also commented favourably on meaningful learning experiences and responsive planning framework developed by teachers. These good practices have been further enhanced through good self-review processes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are enthusiastic and confident in the centre. They are viewed as competent learners and are empowered to make choices about their play, both independently and in group settings. Children are engaged and focussed. They can work collaboratively and engage in undisrupted play for long periods of time. This independent play is well supported by the teachers, who listen well to children’s ideas and contributions and foster their imaginative play.</p><p>Teachers encourage children to explore the thoughtfully resourced environment. They provide a good range of natural and interesting materials to support children’s creativity. There are positive interactions between teachers, children and whānau. Children are articulate and show a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging in this environment.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy is underpinned by the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, which reflects the holistic way children learn and grow. Aspects of the curriculum are well considered. Play and exploration of the learning environment is highly valued. There is strong support for the bi-cultural curriculum, within the environment and through Association support. Children can confidently introduce themselves in te reo and teachers’ capacity is strengthened through the Māori Pou Whakarewa Tikanga. Pumanawatanga has provided a clear framework for bicultural practices.</p><p>There is good flow between the spacious indoor and outdoor areas of play. Information and communication technologies (ICT) are used effectively by teachers to extend children’s interests. Children are provided with many opportunities to develop early literacy and numeracy skills in the context of play. There are good transition processes in place for children when they enrol and when they leave for school.</p><p>Staff work effectively as a team. Management systems and processes are closely linked to association expectations. Teachers value whānau and the community, and invite their perspectives on, involvement in and feedback about the curriculum. They have good knowledge of the local community, are inclusive of all, and know children and their families well.</p><p>Children’s portfolios are attractively put together. Children’s voice is clearly evident. Their learning is analysed well and their interests, knowledge and skills are clearly identified. Reviews of children’s portfolios are providing teachers with a useful overview of their interests and areas where learning could be further extended.</p><p>Self review is thorough, well thought out and clearly documented. It is well used by teachers to evaluate and reflect on their work with children. They make clear links between reviews and the centre’s strategic vision. Self review is also used effectively to provide opportunities for whānau and children to contribute to decision making about new developments or changes to practices. It informs curriculum planning, operations and professional learning needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, Association representatives, management and teachers identified next steps for the kindergarten to be:</p><ul>
<li>for teachers to record their role into children’s learning in portfolios</li>
<li>continuing to encourage parent contribution into their child’s learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Parihaka Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have apotentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Parihaka Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>20 August 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
