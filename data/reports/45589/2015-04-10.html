</table><p>KaTui Early Childhood Learning Centre requires further support from the Ministry of Education to address governance and programme management issues.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>KaTui Early Childhood Learning Centre recently achieved relicensing to comply with 2008 Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres. Required changes in the service showed some improvements to practices that needed attention. However, staffing issues in the past year have led to some improvements not being maintained. While a start has been made to upgrading and implementing administrative systems, learning and care programmes, documentation and personnel management procedures require further work.</p><p>Policies and procedures, including those for personnel management and hygiene processes are in place and now must be followed.</p><p>The centre faces continuing issues with providing professional leadership. This has contributed to an unsettled atmosphere in the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy and vision for the centre are strong and aspirational. However, personnel issues have slowed the centre’s journey towards quality provision for children and their families.</p><p>Teachers’ good care for children up to two years of age is evident in the quiet, calm and loving support children receive. The environment is attractive and provides appropriate play resources for young children.</p><p>Teachers have strong relationships with parents/whānau of the children. The incidental and on-going support for Māori children to take pride in their culture is a strength of the service.</p><p>Teachers require support to improve planning systems. Some teachers demonstrate good practice and make sound reflections about children’s learning. However, generally it is not clearly evident that assessment guides teachers’ thinking about the programme. Children’s portfolios show little information about children’s learning over time.</p><p>Children are relaxed with staff and some teachers enjoy friendly conversations with them. Teachers should talk more with children about their learning, their ideas and interests. A stronger focus on engaging children in conversations about their learning would help them develop their thinking and language skills, and decision-making.</p><p>Children play well with and alongside their peers. There is evidence of tuakana teina relationships between children. Two teachers have benefited from professional development in 2014 about positively guiding children. Children and teachers have responded positively to these teachers’ sharing their new learning. Two more teachers will attend the same professional development this year.</p><p>Management should ensure that the documented appraisal process includes the Registered Teacher Criteria. This would make it possible for appraisers to attest that teachers have met requirements for continued registration. Management will require guidance to develop a new appraisal document and support to implement the new process.</p><p>Teachers use a sound self review framework for considering their work. However, they would benefit from help to fully understand the importance of evaluating and revisiting decision-making. Many review processes remain incomplete.</p><p>The owner has undertaken much work to improve the environment and the quality of resources for children. Teachers have noticed children’s enjoyment of the refurbished play spaces and their increased respect for resources. This improvement work is on-going.</p><p>The owner must urgently select and appoint new staff. Management must ensure that there is a staff member who holds a current first aid certificate present each day. Any new staff, including volunteers, must be police vetted before working in the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers agree that the key next steps are to support teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>increase their understanding and implementation of assessment and planning procedures</li>
<li>strengthen self-review processes to provide evaluative information about the quality of learning programmes and learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>increase conversations with children that recognise them as capable and competent, and support their language development and increase their thinking and problem-solving skills</li>
<li>strengthen teachers’ provision of programmes that challenge children, are based on their interests and strengths and encourage children’s input to decisions about the content of the programme.</li>
</ul><p>Management should:</p><ul>
<li>redevelop and annually implement appraisal processes that include the registered teacher criteria</li>
<li>identify and provide professional development programmes to meet centre and individual teachers’ learning needs, including leadership training</li>
<li>use the existing policies and procedures to guide personnel management processes including police vetting all those who come in contact with the children</li>
<li>ensure that licensing requirements continue to be met.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of KaTui Early Childhood Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to management and governance of the centre. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>personnel management, including police vetting of staff and provision of professional support<em>[Education (Early Childhood Services)Regulations 2008</em></li>
<li>curriculum assessment, planning and evaluation practices<em>[Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008, 43, (1) (a), (i), (ii), (iii), (c) (i), (2). 47 (1) (a),(c),(e). Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C2, C4, C8, C9</em></li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of KaTui Early Childhood Learning Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>10 April 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <colgroup> <col> </colgroup> <colgroup> <col> </colgroup> <colgroup> <col> </colgroup>

</div><h4>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h4><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework<a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/" target="_blank"> Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
