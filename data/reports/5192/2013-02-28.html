<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Owhata Kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. Systems are comprehensive and the programme is inclusive and caters well for all tamariki.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Owhata Kindergarten is situated in the eastern suburbs of Rotorua. The service has strong links with wh&#257;nau, local hap&#363; and is focused on developing links with local marae. Teachers recognise the wealth of knowledge children have when they come to the service. Individualised pepeha are displayed at the entrance and this fosters children&rsquo;s sense of place and identity.</p><p>The kindergarten caters for 40 children from the age of two years up to school age. There are currently 49 children of whom a significant proportion whakapapa to local hap&#363;. Parent participation is highly valued and their aspirations for their children are acknowledged and promoted in the kindergarten programme. A new wh&#257;nau room welcomes parents and provides them with a comfortable place to observe their children and freely converse with one another and teachers.</p><p>The service&rsquo;s philosophy aims to provide many opportunities in the environment where they learn through planned and spontaneous play alongside their peers and kaiako. An integrated bicultural perspective promotes the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and is focused on building partnerships through the use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori.</p><p>Teachers and support staff have responded positively to the previous ERO report. A new head teacher was appointed in 2011, and together with teachers, she is building a strong team culture. The service is efficiently governed and managed by Central North Island Kindergarten Association. The kindergarten is well supported by the professional leader through high-quality induction and ongoing training.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in nine early childhood education services within the Central North Island Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Owhata Kindergarten effectively integrates the concepts of whakamana (enjoyment of learning and self management), kotahitanga (affirming behaviour learning), ng&#257; hononga (participating together) and wh&#257;nau tangata (positive links to hap&#363;, wh&#257;nau, parents and the local and wider community). These concepts are well documented and evident in all areas of the service and have a positive influence on children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>The head teacher, together with staff, provides effective and shared leadership. This collaborative approach encourages teachers to use their skills and expertise to strengthen the quality of care and education for children. Robust self review is used to improve learning outcomes for children, guide decision making and increase teacher capability. Teachers&rsquo; reflections are often about how to improve learning interactions with children. They have developed a learning community that meets the aspirations of children and extends their learning.</p><p>Children benefit from a programme that is responsive to their needs. They experience many opportunities that engage them in purposeful and meaningful play. Children are thinking and developing their interests across a wide range of planned activities. Features of the programme that promote positive learning outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>relationships that are respectful, responsive and reciprocal</li>
<li>an environment rich in resources that extends the specific interests of children</li>
<li>opportunities for self-motivated play</li>
<li>a learning environment that is inclusive and caters for diversity</li>
<li>the integration of emerging concepts in early literacy and mathematics.</li>
</ul><p>Children&rsquo;s curiosity and exploration is nurtured through a range of play activities that support their cultural background. They cooperate with one another and build on friendships within their play. The recent extension to the outdoor play space invites children to challenge and participate in activities that extend their physical skills.</p><p>All children and teachers are working with a Pouawhina to support them to strengthen their understanding of tikanga M&#257;ori. This should assist them to more effectively respond to the aspirations and expectations of wh&#257;nau and tangata whenua. Children, parents and wh&#257;nau are benefiting from a positive approach to the integration te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori throughout the programme.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s learning is captured by teachers in profile books. They often revisit their learning in these books. Teachers should consider reviewing the intent and purpose of profiles to increase the child and parent voice.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Owhata Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
<li>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</li>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>28 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
