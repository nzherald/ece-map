</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Manukau Central Christian Preschool is located within the grounds of the Connect Baptist Church. The church pastor is a member of the management committee that administers the centre, together with parent representatives and teaching staff. The families of some children who attend the centre are church members.</p><p>The centre has provided early childhood services for its culturally diverse community for over twenty years. It benefits from long serving staff and management personnel who promote the centre’s Christian-based philosophy. Many families have had a long association with the centre. Children and their siblings are well known to the staff.</p><p>The centre is licensed under the 2008 regulations. The license allows up to 30 children over the age of two years to attend sessions that are offered four times a week between the hours of 8.30am and 1.00pm. Parents pay no fees for the service. Three and four year old children are prioritised on the roll and there is a waiting list for places.</p><p>The previous ERO report in 2010 noted the centre’s positive and inclusive culture and made some recommendations for improving practice. Since 2010, centre managers have strengthened programme planning and evaluation, and have made extensive improvements to the outdoor environment.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s confidence and progress is well supported. Children enjoy the positive interactions with each other and their teachers. They are enthusiastic participants and engage willingly in planned learning activities. They select from a wide range of resources and make decisions about their play. High quality equipment invites children to experiment and explore. Physical activity is well supported in the redeveloped outdoor area.</p><p>The programme is designed to support children’s transition to school. Children’s play incorporates literacy and numeracy learning in ways that are relevant and interesting. Extending children’s oral language is a key objective of the programme. Clear routines and self-management skills are also helping children develop skills for school life.</p><p>Teachers build effective relationships with parents. They explain the importance of regular attendance and encourage parents’ involvement in children’s learning. They provide parents with information about children’s social and skill development. Evening workshops are held to discuss parenting skills and preparing for school.</p><p>The centre is inclusive of children with special needs and those from diverse social backgrounds. The centre is popular with parents and facilities are fully utilised for all four sessions. Preparation for school is supported by the centre philosophy of learning through play. Integrating bicultural contexts into the planning and the environment benefits all children and affirms the language, culture and identity of Māori children.</p><p>Teachers engage actively with children to support and encourage their participation. Teachers work as a team to identify children’s interests and learning developments. They use this information to plan the programme and evaluate children’s progress. Teachers are improving ways of assessing and documenting learning in children’s individualised portfolios.</p><p>Increased self review is helping the teaching team to identify areas for improvement. They meet often to discuss children’s progress and centre planning. The centre budget is managed carefully and resources are regularly updated. Of the four staff employed, two are qualified and fully registered teachers. The management committee should now ensure that the Registered Teacher Criteria are included in teachers’ appraisal so that their practising certificates can be endorsed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers agree that the centre philosophy is due for review. This process would enable staff to update and share their understanding of good early childhood education practice. The revised philosophy would provide a useful framework for ongoing self review.</p><p>Further developments in the centre should focus on:</p><ul>
<li>making the culture and identify of all children more evident in centre planning</li>
<li>minimising interruptions in learning time to encourage more sustained and complex play</li>
<li>developing a professional learning plan, and strengthening the performance management systems to support teachers’ ongoing development.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Manukau Central Christian Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Centre managers have addressed health and safety requirements in ERO’s 2010 report. They have agreed to date policies and procedures as they are systematically reviewed.</p><p>Centre managers should also implement the Registered Teacher Criteria to appraise teacher performance and endorse teachers’ practising certificates as they become due.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Manukau Central Christian Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>9 October 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
