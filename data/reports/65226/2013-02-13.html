<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Reefton Early Learning will be in a better place to promote positive outcomes for children when the board can find more suitable accommodation for the centre.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The centre was established in 2007. The centre&rsquo;s programme operates for two days each week. There is a long list of children wanting to attend the centre. Board members find it difficult to retain qualified staff because there are no opportunities for full employment.</p><p>The centre is well supported by parents and wh&#257;nau. The operation of the centre has been strengthened by the establishment of a board of trustees. Trustees are committed to finding suitable accommodation so the programme can better meet the learning and wellbeing needs of children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers make a real effort to maintain a consistent approach to providing suitable learning experiences to meet children's needs.</p><p>Relationships between teachers and children are inclusive, positive and caring. Parents are made to feel welcome. Teachers are well supported through professional development to improve their understanding and knowledge of M&#257;ori children as M&#257;ori. Teachers are reflective about their teaching and its impact on children&rsquo;s learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Teachers track individual children well so they can effectively respond to their interests and learning needs. Interactions between children and teachers help children develop thinking and problem-solving strategies. There are good opportunities for imaginative play. Children have good access to an appropriate range of literacy and numeracy activities. Contact with local schools is helping children successfully transition to school.</p><p>The board of trustees is effectively led and works hard to address the significant factors that are inhibiting the development of the centre and its programme. Board planning is sound and policies and procedures are regularly reviewed.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s supervisor promotes reflective practices across the staff and supports teachers to work together as a team. She is beginning to formalise self-review processes and to use the findings to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy focuses on meeting the needs and interests of individual children. There is a need to strengthen the philosophy so that it can be used more effectively to guide future teaching practice, building developments and the provision of learning resources.</p><p>In the present circumstances, teachers are finding it very difficult to develop effective strategies that support children&rsquo;s learning when there are several days between sessions.</p><p>The teachers are aware of the need to further develop the effectiveness of children&rsquo;s learning stories. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>identifying and sharing next possible learning opportunities with children and parents</li>
<li>seeking parents&rsquo; views as partners in the creating of learning stories.</li>
</ul><p>The next step for the board and teachers is to review how teaching practices impact on children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers&rsquo; appraisal processes need strengthening to ensure the centre manager and teachers receive high quality feedback against goals relating to improving outcomes for children.</p><p>The board is very aware of the need to rigorously pursue the development of centre facilities so the programme can fully address children&rsquo;s learning and wellbeing needs.</p><p>ERO has asked the board for a report, at least annually, on progress towards this goal.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Reefton Early Learning Centre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>13 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
