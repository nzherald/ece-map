<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Waimamaku Playcentre is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Waimamaku Playcentre is a small, rural centre that plays a key role in catering for the local community&rsquo;s younger families. It is open on Tuesday and Thursday each week and provides a programme for infants and children up to five years of age. The Playcentre operates as a parent co-operative and is part of the Mid Northland Playcentre Association. The Playcentre philosophy of children and families learning together is strongly evident.</p><p>Centre members demonstrate a strong commitment to maintaining centre viability and building on their Playcentre training levels. More experienced members support and encourage newer members to build their capability.</p><p>Regular representation from the Playcentre at Association meetings, followed with feedback to other centre members, helps all members to be informed about Playcentre matters beyond the local level. A current priority for members is the preparation for relicensing with the Ministry of Education under the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008.</p><p>Centre members responded well to ERO&rsquo;s 2009 review. They have successfully focused on promoting children&rsquo;s independence and improving programme provision for literacy, numeracy and science in the curriculum.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Centre members invest good time and energy into their Playcentre role. The centre is managed effectively. A strategic plan that includes appropriate objectives is in place. Training in self review, guided by a Playcentre trainer, has resulted in the establishment of review processes aimed at improving programme outcomes for children.</p><p>Encouraging and positive relationships are a feature of the Playcentre. A culture of openness results in good communication between centre members. Children and families demonstrate a clear sense of belonging within the Playcentre community. Adults support each other very well and inclusive practice is well embedded.</p><p>Children enjoy a programme that provides challenge within a supportive environment. Older children engage in collaborative play, independent of adults. They have many opportunities for being creative and imaginative. Adults are sensitive about the needs of children up to two years of age. Purposeful and skilled adults provide a good range of opportunities to extend children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>The Playcentre&rsquo;s curriculum is based on <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, New Zealand&rsquo;s early childhood curriculum framework. Children learn through play in a resource-rich environment. The values and priorities of centre families are reflected in the programme as members share their skills and knowledge with others. Centre members are thoughtful about the ways they can provide a bicultural curriculum and encourage the participation of wh&#257;nau M&#257;ori. Significant use is made of trips within the local and wider community to broaden children&rsquo;s knowledge.</p><p>Good information about children&rsquo;s learning is documented at planning meetings. Centre members share their knowledge of each child, their current learning and developmental stage. Some members skilfully analyse their observations of children and document the links between the programme and children&rsquo;s learning. Other members continue to develop their skills in this area.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>ERO and centre members agree that next steps for centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>planning for the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the Playcentre&rsquo;s strategic plan to determine progress against the plan&rsquo;s objectives and to identify the impact on outcomes for children</li>
<li>improving the resourcing of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to support centre members with record keeping and to assist with communication.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Waimamaku Playcentre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>26 November 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
