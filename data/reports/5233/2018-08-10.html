</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Koromiko Kindergarten is licensed to provide all day education and care for up to 37 children, aged over two years. Of the 56 enrolled, 10 identify as Māori.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy, reviewed in 2017, emphasises the importance of relationships with whānau, bicultural approaches, the value of children's play and learning and includes a strong focus on environmentally sustainable practices.</p><p>A parent committee supports the kindergarten with fundraising, finances and community events. The kindergarten participates in the Enviroschools programme, and is a member of the early years network group in Hawera. All teachers at Koromiko Kindergarten are fully qualified.</p><p>Koromiko Kindergarten is one of 24 kindergartens governed and managed by Kindergarten Taranaki - Te Putahi Kura Pūhou Taranaki (the organisation). Day-to-day management of the organisation is the responsibility of the chief executive. A governing board sets the overall strategic direction. A professional manager and two professional leaders provide regular support and a range of learning and development opportunities for teachers. An operations manager supports kindergartens' policy development and compliance.</p><p>In 2017, the board developed a strategic plan with the intention for individual kindergartens to align their strategic plans to the organisation's goals and measures. The <em>Quality Evaluation Tool</em> was introduced in late 2017. The purpose of this document is for teachers to self-assess teaching and learning practices to inform internal evaluation and improve outcomes for children.</p><p>The May 2015 ERO report identified that the kindergarten's internal evaluation and inclusion of te ao Māori into the curriculum were areas to continue to strengthen. Progress is ongoing.</p><p>ERO also identified areas for the organisation to strengthen. These included:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing the annual plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening systems and processes for performance management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistent implementation of appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing and clarifying the role of the professional leaders in building teachers’ capability.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Progress in these areas is evident.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five reviews in Kindergarten Taranaki - Te Putahi Kura Pūhou Taranaki.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children actively engage in learning in a play-based programme within which their wellbeing, independence, creativity and interests are promoted. The indoor and outdoor spaces have been thoughtfully designed to engage children in a range of interesting experiences. Environmentally sustainable practices are evident and integrated throughout the curriculum. These opportunities help to develop children's knowledge of the living world and their sense of belonging at the kindergarten.</p><p>Teachers competently support and extend children's play and learning. Literacy, numeracy and science are integrated into the curriculum. There is a balance of child and teacher-led experiences. Manaakitanga and whanaungatanga are valued and evident. A strong sense of community is effectively promoted.</p><p>Children with diverse learning needs are very well supported to engage with the curriculum through inclusive practices and initiatives. Teachers liaise with parents and whānau, as well as external agencies, to plan and monitor children's wellbeing and learning.</p><p>A revised assessment, planning and evaluation system is being implemented. Teachers identify learning goals for individual children and develop strategies to support these goals. Children's assessment records show evidence of their participation in the programme and progress over time. The planned curriculum is closely aligned to <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and Koromiko Kindergarten's philosophy. Teachers should now strengthen how they:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>gather and record information about children's cultural knowledge and experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>align specific teaching strategies to children's established learning goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Well-considered transitions into kindergarten support children's wellbeing and confidence. The head teacher promotes a focus on developing relationships with local schools.</p><p>Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are integrated throughout the kindergarten's curriculum. Children's sense of belonging is enhanced through cultural artefacts and celebrations. Positive relationships between parents and teachers assist children to develop an understanding of the diverse cultures within their community.</p><p>The head teacher leads a team of highly reflective and collaborative teachers who are improvement focused. They are motivated to access relevant professional development to support their ongoing learning. This contributes to useful reviews that lead to improved outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers are increasingly responsive to the culture language and identity of Māori children. This is supported by the organisation's environmental focus, consideration of localised bicultural values, and teacher development goals and professional learning opportunities. A number of new initiatives and systems have been developed by the organisation that should further develop these aspects of practice.</p><p>The organisation generally provides useful governance and management support for this kindergarten. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>purposeful support from the professional leaders to build teacher capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effective and targeted teacher and leadership development through an appraisal process and a range of professional learning opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Organisation leaders are purposefully building teachers’ understanding of internal evaluation through ongoing mentoring. Teachers should continue to clearly measure the impact of practices on children’s learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the professional leader and teachers agree the following key next steps for Koromiko Kindergarten are to further develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>acknowledgement of children's culture and language in assessment documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>alignment of teaching strategies to improve children's outcomes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO and Kindergarten Taranaki agree that the organisation should further develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>quality assurance processes and guidelines linked to compliance with regulations and association expectations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a policy framework to support kindergartens.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Managers and leaders should consolidate newly introduced plans and processes and evaluate the effectiveness of practices and operation across all levels of the organisation.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Koromiko Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Koromiko Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>10 August 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
