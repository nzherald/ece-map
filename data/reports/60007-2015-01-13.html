</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Martinborough Playcentre is one of three parent-led early childhood centres administered by the Wairarapa Playcentre Association, (the association) which oversees governance operations. An executive committee provides the adult education programme, guidance and support for members. A centre support person is employed by the executive to visit playcentres and provide professional advice and feedback to strengthen practice and promote improvement.</p><p>The playcentre operates mixed-age sessions, three mornings per week. Each session is run by a team of parents whose responsibility is to set up, maintain activities and complete the end-of-session evaluation and planning for the next week. The recently reviewed centre philosophy &lsquo;Ko te hapu i tipu i tenei tamaiti&rsquo; (It takes a village to raise a child) reflects the supportive rural community that surrounds the playcentre.</p><p>Concerns identified in the March 2013 ERO report continue to be addressed. The&nbsp;New&nbsp;Zealand Playcentre Federation has provided centre members with professional learning and development in: self review; planning, assessment and evaluation; and positive guidance. This training has had a positive impact on the quality of the children&rsquo;s programme.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three playcentre reviews in the Wairarapa Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The curriculum is strongly child-led with adults taking supporting roles. The environment is welcoming and inclusive. Adults and children learn together and develop friendships with others in the community. Centre members model enthusiasm for learning to their own children. ERO agrees with centre leaders, that adults should be encouraged to engage with and support each other&rsquo;s children more, to better reflect their philosophy. Children are likely to become more independent and participate in cooperative play with their peers.</p><p>An exciting range of learning opportunities allows children to make connections with people, places and things of significance to their families and community. The thoughtfully presented learning environment promotes children&rsquo;s exploration and sense of adventure. Children&rsquo;s creativity and imagination is intentionally nurtured. They are positively supported in their introduction to mathematical concepts. The atmosphere is calm and purposeful.</p><p>Useful processes for assessment have been established. Programme planning is informed by children&rsquo;s interests, parents&rsquo; ideas and session evaluations. Leaders are committed to ongoing support for the development of members&rsquo; professional knowledge. Assessment of children&rsquo;s learning is a current focus.</p><p>Te ao M&#257;ori is reflected through waiata, signage and modelling of basic te reo M&#257;ori. Increasing the capability of centre members and continuing to develop programmes that are responsive to the local environment is a next step for development.</p><p>Leadership is collaborative and assists parents to increase their knowledge and understanding of appropriate practice for the education and care of children.</p><p>Self review is developing. Centre members agree that review requires further embedding to provide positive outcomes for all children and their families.</p><p>Strategic planning clearly identifies the service&rsquo;s priorities and actions to support achievement of objectives. Agreed next development steps are identified. These are monitored against expected outcomes to measure progress.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Members have identified that they should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop self review, embedding processes that lead to improvement and change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance culturally responsive practice by relating to the local history of the area.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association provides good support and a range of training for members. Since the previous ERO report it has provided new personnel to support centres. The association should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assist members to address the key next steps they have identified.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Martinborough Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h3>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h3><p>The next ERO review of Martinborough Playcentre will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie,</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region,</p><p>13 January 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
