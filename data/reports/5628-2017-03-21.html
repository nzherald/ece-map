</table><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Hawthornden Road is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Hawthornden Road is one of 71 early learning services governed and managed by Canterbury Westland Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The kindergarten caters for the education and care of children, aged between two and five years old, from the increasingly diverse community that it serves.</p><p>There have been some recent significant changes to leadership and to the teaching team. A new education service manager (ESM) and acting head teacher were appointed in Term 3 2016. An experienced relieving teacher was also appointed. All teachers are fully qualified and certified in early childhood education. The association and ESM provide consistent professional support to ensure the effective operation of the service.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have made some progress in meeting the recommendations outlined in the 2012 ERO report. This includes the development of more child-focused routines, refining programme planning, and building a team approach to self review. The teaching team is implementing a new vision for the kindergarten which is centred on providing a calm and peaceful learning environment for children.</p><p>The teaching team has made purposeful links to the local learning cluster of other early learning services and schools to help children in their community make a positive transition to school.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine kindergartens governed and managed by the Canterbury Westland Kidsfirst Free Kindergartens Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten is well supported by a responsive parent community who are actively involved in the life of the kindergarten. Parents and whānau are warmly welcomed and encouraged to spend time in the programme with their own and other children. Teachers highly value parent and whānau contributions and the support they receive from the kindergarten's community.</p><p>Teachers foster positive, reciprocal relationships with children and families within an inclusive learning environment. The culture of each family is acknowledged and valued. Teachers work with children and families in respectful ways. Children’s first languages are affirmed and celebrated.</p><p>Teachers are committed to providing and developing practices that help children to experience the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand in ways that are respectful of the Māori culture.</p><p>The child-led curriculum is increasingly focused on unhurried interactions between teachers and children. Teachers listen carefully to children and allow uninterrupted time for children to make choices and express and develop ideas. The recent innovative use of technologies inspires children's creativity, imagination and dramatic play. These experiences and deliberate acts of teaching support the development of children's oral language, creative thinking and decision-making skills.</p><p>Teachers thoughtfully present a wide variety of learning experiences that provoke children's curiosity and encourage exploration. Children have many opportunities to learn about the natural world and be involved in physical challenges in a spacious outdoor area. Literacy and numeracy are integrated in ways that are meaningful for children.</p><p>Children play independently alongside others and in small groups for sustained lengths of time. Teachers are involved in children's play encouraging social relationships, friendships and learning.</p><p>Parents are well informed of children’s learning interests and participation in the programme through attractively-presented, informative wall displays and individual profile books.</p><p>A comprehensive systematic internal evaluation process focuses on improving children’s learning opportunities and teaching practices. The ESM is building new leadership capacity, teachers' reflective practices and internal evaluation capability.</p><p>The Canterbury Westland Free Kindergarten Association is well supported by an experienced, professional board. The association has a well-understood vision and targeted strategic and annual planning systems. There are close links between the kindergarten plans, internal evaluation, appraisal and professional development. Teachers are well supported by association managers and leaders to achieve the priorities of the association, and their own kindergarten objectives and vision to provide high quality learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>The association has a very strong commitment to providing high quality professional development to build on leadership capacity and teacher capability. It has high expectations for teaching and learning and equitable outcomes for all children. This includes the appointment of a kaitautoko to further promote a strong focus Tiriti aspirations at all levels of the organisation.</p><p>The Canterbury Westland Free Kindergarten Association is innovative in its approaches and regularly seeks opportunities to be involved in wider educational and local communities to promote high quality learning outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The education service manager and ERO agree that the key next steps are to continue to develop recent initiatives to support the teaching team to fully realise the kindergarten vision. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>consolidating new processes and practices for internal evaluation and programme planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building on assessment practices to add depth to teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen bicultural perspectives and practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fully implementing and embedding new appraisal processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The chief executive has identified and ERO’s evaluation has confirmed, that the key next step for the association is to continue to its property improvement long-term plan, ensuring that enhancements to its buildings reflect the changing needs of its communities.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Hawthornden Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Hawthornden Road will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer, Southern - Te Waipounamu</p><p>21 March 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
