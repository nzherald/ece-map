</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Junior Junction Sunnynook offers full day care and education and can cater for 75 children, including 25 up to two years of age. The centre is staffed by a good number of qualified teachers, assisted by other staff in training or in support roles. Three rooms cater for infants, toddlers and older children. Environments are relevant for the age groups of children in each room. Opportunities during the day to share outdoor play spaces add interest and challenge for children.</p><p>There are five Junior Junction centres in Auckland and one in Hamilton. The owner delegates responsibility for the day-to-day operation and management of the centre to the centre manager. Two team leaders provide assistance to the manager and have leadership responsibilities within their areas.</p><p>This is the second ERO review of the centre. In March 2013 ERO reported that the centre was well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The good practices noted at that time continue. The 2013 report also recommended some improvements to programme planning and resourcing. The centre has continued to progress these aspects of its service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and settled across the centre. They initiate and enjoy interactions with adults and with each other. Children spend good periods of time together in creative, imaginative play. They collaborate well and are supported by teachers to be socially competent. Children are encouraged to take care of themselves and manage aspects of daily routines independently.</p><p>Teachers are warm and friendly. They respond quickly to children and are sensitive to each child's preferences and routines. Teachers of the older children could continue to improve routines to ensure these are responsive to children's engagement in play. Individualised transitions into the centre and between rooms help children and families through this process. Work has begun on refining transition to school practices and programmes.</p><p>Some teachers use te reo Māori in their conversations. Wall displays include te reo prompts and aspects of Te Ao Māori. The multicultural nature of the service is well reflected in displays and in the variety of festivals celebrated in the centre. The large number of children who are English as second language learners are well supported. Teachers use their own language skills to support children and families. Teachers could find it useful to explore research in second language learning.</p><p>Centre staff promote the benefits of healthy food and regular exercise with children. The centre provides meals for children and menus are reviewed and revised to ensure ingredients are appropriate. A regular external programme provides additional physical activity for children. In consultation with the centre community, an evaluation of the ways in which birthdays are celebrated could promote alternative options for families.</p><p>Teachers' reflective practice continues to develop through regular internal evaluation. Centre expectations for programme evaluation in each room is supported with clear strategies and guidelines for staff. Good operational structures and a policy base are in place to guide practice. Well established systems and practices help staff record and monitor health and safety.</p><p>Teachers follow the notice, recognise and respond framework to document children's learning. This framework provides a useful tool that could replace other planning and recording templates that staff are finding less useful. Teachers use an electronic system to record and share learning. They are getting a good response from families who are enjoying the ready accessibility to this information. Professional learning for the staff team could be useful in gaining consistency of programme management across the centre.</p><p>The centre manager has led a successful focus on strengthening communication amongst staff and building a more positive team culture. Beneficial outcomes of this focus include more confident leadership and a greater sense of cohesion amongst staff. In order to continue this good progress, the centre manager should continue to monitor the quality of teamwork and staff satisfaction.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have identified some key next steps for the centre. ERO agrees that these should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the development of a clear, effective and regular appraisal process that is integrated with requirements of the teacher registration process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing the complexity of children's learning through a more child-initiated programme and teacher interactions that encourage and extend children's thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>considering the usefulness and accessibility of programme displays for children and families, and the ways teachers show have they have responded to identified next steps for children's learning and development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing strategic planning in consultation with staff to determine development priorities and guide budgeting.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Junior Junction Sunnynook completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Junior Junction Sunnynook will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>29 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
