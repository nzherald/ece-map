</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Play and Learn Clarks Beach is one of three Play and Learn centres located south of Auckland. The centre is licensed for 39 children, with a maximum of five under the age of two years. The centre is located in the modified ground floor of the owner’s home, looking out over the Manukau Harbour.</p><p>The owner manages her centres and is a fully qualified and experienced teacher. The day-to-day running of Play and Learn Clarks Beach is coordinated by a supervisor. All staff are experienced and almost all are registered teachers.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy promotes the development of happy and resilient children who have a passion for lifelong learning, and the ability to build positive relationships, to solve problems and to take on challenges in a safe environment. Creativity and an appreciation of the natural environment are also identified as important goals for children.</p><p>Children under two years of age have their own play space and a teacher who provides their primary care. They are able to interact freely with the older children.</p><p>The 2011 ERO report commented positively on the centre’s educational programme and resources, and its strong professional leadership. The report noted that children confidently follow their own interests and often play collaboratively. It was agreed that self review, including the monitoring of the effectiveness of the programme, could be extended.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children. Teachers work effectively as a team and the owner continues to provide effective leadership with a strong focus on improving outcomes for children. The centre philosophy is very evident in the programme.</p><p>Children make choices about how they spend their time at the centre. Teachers work alongside them, helping them to access resources and information. Children engage in meaningful conversations with each other and with their teachers. Teachers are effective in supporting children’s play by asking thought provoking questions and encouraging children to persist and explore.</p><p>Older children, their parents and teachers all contribute to programme planning and evaluation. Teachers meet regularly with children to talk about what they have been doing and how they might want to extend their play. Parents regularly contribute to the planning of their child’s educational programme.</p><p>Planning for younger children is also informed by contributions from parents. Teachers consider each child’s interests and stages of development when planning the education programme. Children under two years are in an environment where they can grow in confidence with the support of other children and adults. Their home routines are followed and parents are kept well informed about their time at the centre.</p><p>The education programme deliberately provides many opportunities for children to engage with the natural environment and with the community outside of the centre. Children often go on excursions to the local beach and further afield. A group of older children regularly experience ‘forest school’ education where they build their independence and knowledge of the natural world.</p><p>The centre manager provides staff with relevant opportunities to develop new skills and knowledge. Performance management systems help teachers identify their strengths and provide opportunities to reflect on and improve their professional practice.</p><p>Teachers work in partnership with parents very well. They communicate effectively with them about the centre and about their children’s learning. Parents have opportunities to learn about effective early childhood educational practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre staff have identified that they could strengthen their bicultural practices to support the identity, language and culture of Māori children at the centre.</p><p>In discussion with ERO, the manager agreed that to improve practice the centre would review:</p><ul>
<li>assessment practices to ensure that the children’s learning over time was more clearly recorded</li>
<li>the way excursions are documented to ensure that the centre’s good practices are recorded</li>
<li>strategic planning and appraisal goals to ensure that they are more specific and measureable so that progress towards meeting goals could be more clearly reported.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Play and Learn Clarks Beach completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Play and Learn Clarks Beach will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey<br> National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
