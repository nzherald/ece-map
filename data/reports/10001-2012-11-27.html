<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Massey Uni at Albany ECE - Kids Dept is well placed to continue to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>This community based centre is located within the grounds of Massey University, Albany. The service is an incorporated society and benefits from a supportive management committee. The committee is representative of children&rsquo;s parents, who are either studying or teaching at the university.</p><p>The centre has separate areas for three age groups of children up to five years of age. The staff philosophy of building a nurturing and stimulating environment is reflected in the high quality of learning and care provided for the children.</p><p>The centre has a history of positive ERO reports and the teaching team has continued to improve the service. All staff hold either early childhood or primary school qualifications. High adult to child ratios enable teachers to support children&rsquo;s learning and engagement well.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Infants and toddlers experience high quality interactions with teachers. Children&rsquo;s sense of well being and belonging is nurtured by teachers&rsquo; respectful relationships. Their language development is promoted well by teachers&rsquo; modelling and affirmation of their early attempts to communicate.</p><p>Children are recognised as capable, articulate and confident learners. They explore and experiment in a well resourced and stimulating learning environment. Individual creativity is encouraged and children&rsquo;s persistence is developed. Children&rsquo;s ideas are valued and complexity in play is promoted. Children also benefit from frequent access to the outdoor learning environment.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and strengths. Literacy, numeracy and science are integrated into the programme. Children enjoy good access to information and communication technologies (ICT). Children&rsquo;s learning portfolios provide attractive analyses of their learning.</p><p>Teachers acknowledge the wide diversity of children&rsquo;s backgrounds through the use of music in the programme. They have prioritised the goal of using more te reo M&#257;ori and reflecting tikanga M&#257;ori in the programme and the centre environment to extend children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>The stable teaching team accesses professional development to help them improve the quality of the programme. Teachers have established a process of self review. They should now broaden its scope and significance by reviewing against the strands of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. Centre self review, together with ERO&rsquo;s external review, has identified the following areas for development:</p><ul>
<li>documenting expectations about teachers&rsquo; use of effective teaching practices and linking these expectations to appraisal processes</li>
<li>sharing planning with parents and inviting their input into the programme</li>
<li>promoting opportunities for children to set their own learning goals</li>
<li>evaluating and documenting the impact of the programme on children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>increasing the use of parents&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s perspectives in portfolios to record children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Massey Uni At Albany ECE - Kids Dept completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve health and safety practices, managers should ensure that all non-registered staff are police vetted every three years.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>27 November 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
