<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Nuffield is located in New Brighton. It operates for six hours per day on an all day licence for children over the age of two.</p><p align="left">All teachers are fully qualified and registered.</p><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergarten Nuffield is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures, a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety, and regular professional development support and opportunities for teachers.</p><p align="left">Teachers know children and their families well. They provide good quality learning programmes that effectively cater for children&rsquo;s individual learning needs and interests.</p><p align="left">Other positive features of this kindergarten are:</p><ul>
<li>the welcoming and inclusive environment</li>
<li>the way teachers support children&rsquo;s learning and social development</li>
<li>strong links with families and the local community</li>
<li>the well-organised and resourced physical environment.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Teachers provide children with a wide range of learning experiences with an emphasis on literacy and creativity.</p><p align="left">The next steps to further improve outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>further developing practices that clearly identify children&rsquo;s strengths and interests</li>
<li>strengthening processes to evaluate the impact of changes.</li>
</ul><p align="left">This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, families, personnel and property. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Nuffield was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergartens Nuffield.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy states that children and their wh&#257;nau are welcomed and acknowledged as individuals. Parents are informed of and encouraged to be involved in their child&rsquo;s learning. Teachers provide an environment that is safe, challenging and includes bicultural experiences and an awareness of the natural world.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4>Relationships</h4><p align="left">Children benefit from positive and caring relationships with teachers. They are warmly welcomed into the kindergarten and supported to settle quickly into activities. Teachers are responsive to children&rsquo;s individual needs and differences. Children are confident to approach teachers to share their learning or when they need help. Teachers provide a calm and organised environment which encourages children to play co-operatively. This contributes to children&rsquo;s sense of belonging and well being at the kindergarten.</p><h4>Supporting children&rsquo;s social competence</h4><p align="left">Teachers are successfully using a wide range of practices to enhance children&rsquo;s learning and social development. They effectively:</p><ul>
<li>design programmes that respond well to children&rsquo;s abilities and needs</li>
<li>support how children relate to one another</li>
<li>provide children with clear expectations and routines.</li>
</ul><h4>Links with families</h4><p align="left">Teachers have strong links with the families, wh&#257;nau and the local environment and know children and their families well. Teachers take time to offer parents guidance and mentoring and provide a wide range of information about parenting.</p><h4>Teaching practices</h4><p align="left">Teachers work well together to improve outcomes for children. They make good use of daily reflections to plan and adapt the programme to meet the interests and needs of children. Teachers are using a variety of ways to foster children&rsquo;s language development.</p><h4>Environment</h4><p align="left">Children learn and play in a well-organised environment. They have easy access to a wide range of challenging and age-appropriate resources. Teachers present activities in interesting and inviting ways and children are able to make choices about what they want to participate in. Te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori are clearly evident in natural ways throughout the environment and in the programme.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><h4>Assessment</h4><p align="left">Teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that they need to review assessment practices. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>considering ways to extend child and parent voice in the learning stories</li>
<li>review how clearly written assessment records identify meaningful learning and how they provide parents with appropriate information.</li>
</ul><h4>Self review</h4><p align="left">Teachers have identified that self review is an area they want to develop further. This includes how well they record parents&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s ideas. Teachers&rsquo; daily reflections could benefit from including specific next steps that they are going to take to support children&rsquo;s development or behaviour.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of Children with Moderate to Severe Special Needs</h3><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing wellbeing, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the kindergarten is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3><p align="left">The kindergarten currently has several children enrolled with both severe and moderate learning needs. The philosophy of the kindergarten states their commitment to meet the needs of all children and to provide an inclusive environment for children and their families.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4>Identifying and responding</h4><p align="left">The managers and teachers support children and their families well. They gather useful information when they come into the kindergarten and continue to monitor children closely during their first weeks in the programme. The teachers work well as a team and effectively involve outside agencies to respond to the identified needs of children. They effectively adapt the programme to suit the child&rsquo;s developmental stage and their interests. Teachers reflect regularly on the impact of their additional support and seek ways to strengthen their practices.</p><h4>Involvement in the programme</h4><p align="left">Managers and teachers ensure that children with severe or moderate learning needs are able to participate in the kindergarten&rsquo;s programme. They support the children well to participate in learning activities with other children, including modifying resources and adding visual prompts. Teachers successfully encourage all children to be supportive of children with special needs. They provide children with strategies and foster the concept of tuakana teina, expecting all to help each other. Through these and other ways, they effectively build the children&rsquo;s social competence and confidence.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><h4>Modifying assessments</h4><p align="left">Teachers could consider further ways to adapt their assessments to better fit the development and needs of these children. This could include:</p><ul>
<li>highlighting the key learning that links to the child&rsquo;s individual plan</li>
<li>increase opportunities to include parent voice in assessment and feedback.</li>
</ul><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Nuffield completed an ERO Centre Management Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the kindergarten&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-nuffield" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Nuffield</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kidsfirst Kindergartens Nuffield.</p><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Nuffield is located in New Brighton. It operates for six hours per day on an all day licence for children over the age of two.</p><p align="left">All teachers are fully qualified and registered.</p><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergarten Nuffield is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures, a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety, and regular professional development support and opportunities for teachers.</p><p align="left">Teachers know children and their families well. They provide good quality learning programmes that effectively cater for children&rsquo;s individual learning needs and interests.</p><p align="left">Other positive features of this kindergarten are:</p><ul>
<li>the welcoming and inclusive environment</li>
<li>the way teachers support children&rsquo;s learning and social development</li>
<li>strong links with families and the local community</li>
<li>the well-organised and resourced physical environment.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Teachers provide children with a wide range of learning experiences with an emphasis on literacy and creativity.</p><p align="left">The next steps to further improve outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>further developing practices that clearly identify children&rsquo;s strengths and interests</li>
<li>strengthening processes to evaluate the impact of changes.</li>
</ul><p align="left">This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, families, personnel and property. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p></html>
