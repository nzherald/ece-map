</table><p>In order to improve educational outcomes for children, centre operations, including quality of teaching practice, require further development.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tiny Tots Educare is located in Rotorua and provides education and care for children from birth to school age. The centre is a small family-owned and operated service that aims to provide quality education in a caring environment. The roll is 20, including eight Māori children. There have been minimal changes to the teaching staff since the 2014 ERO review.</p><p>The 2014 ERO review noted that there was positive and affirming interactions among teachers and children, and that the supportive learning environment was providing good opportunities for children to play and explore. However, areas identified for development relating to appraisal, assessment, learning resources and property maintenance have not been sufficiently addressed. The service has had a mixed reporting history with the Education Review Office.</p><p>Recent developments in the service are the introduction of an online assessment system, communication books for parents of children under two years, and professional learning and development for teachers in aspects of self review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre enjoys positive and supportive relationships with its parents. Parents and whānau and their children are made welcome, and there are good opportunities for parents to keep informed about their children's learning. Regular information about learning is provided through daily conversations, and online assessment system and infants' notebooks. The home-like setting provides a relaxed and friendly environment for children, their parents and whānau.</p><p>Children enjoy active physical play. They make decisions about their level of participation in the programme and frequently request further equipment or resources to enrich their play. There are opportunities for children to problem solve and make independent choices. Some timely conversations with children capture teachable moments as learning opportunities surface in the context of play.</p><p>However, aspects of teaching practice need to be improved. Teachers need to develop a clear and shared understanding of children's development that is based on current research in early childhood practice. Children's learning and development is not being fully maximised or extended.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers should now work collaboratively to develop and implement a philosophy for learning and teaching. There is a need to clarify current theory and approaches to teaching for infants and older children.</p><p>There continues to be a need to purchase sufficient, appropriate resources, furniture and equipment to cater for the range of learning and abilities of children. While children are able to move easily between indoor and outdoor areas, they are not regularly provided with a stimulating variety of equipment that invites and deepens their learning and play. Teachers should review the programme to ensure that activities and the range of resources are sufficiently broad and varied. This review and development is necessary to ensure children are extended and challenged in their learning and play.</p><p>A bicultural dimension is not yet strongly evident within the centre's programme. Throughout the day teachers use some basic te reo Māori and engage children in waiata. However, more work is needed to develop teachers' confidence to integrate a Māori perspective into the curriculum and to use Māori language more frequently.</p><p>Self review for ongoing improvement of the service is in the early stages of development. Teachers have yet to realise the benefits of the process in raising outcomes for children. Self review is not leading to well informed and/or sustained shifts in practice.</p><p>Currently performance management systems do not support the ongoing professional growth of teachers. The appraisal process is not sufficiently robust and there are no clearly defined and up-to-date job descriptions, appraisal policies or procedures. Centre management must develop and implement a process to support teachers through the teacher registration process. Leaders must put in place a mentoring process to support teachers, and ensure that they are consistently collecting evidence in relation to the practicing teacher criteria.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tiny Tots Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Employment and performance management (GM8)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sufficient quality of resources for the learning and abilities of children (PF4)</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>Teachers understanding of children's development and knowledge of relevant theories and practice in Early Childhood Education (C4)<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tiny Tots Educare will be within two years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>24 February 2017 </p><h3><span>The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
