<p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Glen Warren Kindergarten is a new kindergarten which opened in August 2013. It is one of four kindergartens governed by the Oamaru Kindergarten Association (OKA). The kindergarten receives ongoing support from an external evaluation services manager, the association general manager and governing board made up of parents from the kindergarten communities. Three of the current parents are board members.</p>
<p>The kindergarten is located within the grounds of Oamaru North School. It has recently been fully licensed by the Ministry of Education and is licensed for 30 children.</p>
<p>The board, managers and teachers have carefully planned and redeveloped a building and environment to make the best use of spaces in meeting children's needs. The cultural and diverse needs of this community have been thoughtfully provided for at this kindergarten.</p>
<p>The new teaching team is working well together to provide positive outcomes for children. Teachers have quickly created very inclusive and welcoming culture. This fits well with their philosophy which aims to build 'responsive and reciprocal relationships between people, places and things'. The head teacher and teachers carefully consider the views and wishes of parents.</p>
<p>Children benefit from the many excursions and short trips they have into the neighbouring school, such as visits to the library and regular participation in a junior -school exercise programme. These visits support a smooth transition for children moving from kindergarten to school. Children enjoy and help prepare food for many of the kindergarten meals.</p>
<p>This review was part of a cluster of 3 reviews in the Oamaru Kindergarten Association.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>There are supportive, caring and respectful relationships between teachers and children, children and children and in the way all the staff work together. Children are familiar and comfortable with their teachers and freely approach them for support and acknowledgement. Teachers respond to children's needs and interests.</p>
<p>Teachers are successfully building supportive relationships between the children and their families. This has been a high priority, particularly during the establishment of the kindergarten. Families are welcomed and take many opportunities to stay and settle their children, and contribute to the programme. Parents readily contribute to the daily learning book. Children have quickly established a sense of belonging and are beginning to develop a sense of responsibility and care for their environment.</p>
<p>The kindergarten is well resourced and managed. It effectively provides for children to make choices and independently access materials for their play, activities and care. Teachers deliberately structure the environment and activities to extend children's learning. Teachers have reflected the cultural diversity of the children in the environment through visual displays, artefacts and natural resources. They are sensitive to children's diverse needs and adapt resources for them accordingly.</p>
<p>The outdoor environment provides well for children's physical activity. Children can participate in carpentry and small-group activities outside and under cover.</p>
<p>The learning programme has many positive features. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the teachers identifying children's interests and dispositions and intentionally planning to meet these</li>
<li>a focus on arts, music and performance which engage children for sustained periods</li>
<li>a programme which strongly reflects a multicultural dimension, including many aspects of te ao Maori</li>
<li>the establishment of useful routines and expectations for children</li>
<li>children enjoying leadership roles and responsibilities including helping other children and preparing food.</li>
</ul>
<p>Children showed a strong pride in their culture, particularly when they were able to take lead roles in dance and song. Tongan children experience many very good examples of their culture being valued and celebrated in the programme and environment. Children's profile books effectively capture children's cultural identity. The teachers have consulted parents about priorities for their children's learning and strive to meet these.</p>
<p>The head teacher is new to her role. She is in the process of building a team of teachers. She is well supported by the association, locally and regionally. There are useful systems to ensure the expectations of the general manager and education services manager are met. The education services manager provides very effective support for the kindergarten and the staff.</p>
<p>Staff have a shared philosophy for children's learning and understanding of key systems within the kindergarten. Teachers reflect on their teaching and the programme and strive to improve this. They respond well to spontaneous learning opportunities provided by the children and the environment. Teachers communicate well with one another about aspects of the programme.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>The head teacher has identified that it is now time to embed and sustain the many good practices that have begun. It is now timely for a schedule to be documented to ensure that all aspects of the kindergarten are reviewed over time.</p>
<p>The head teacher and teachers should strengthen:</p>
<ul>
<li>planning for individual children to make clearer the learning intentions and what teachers will do to support children</li>
<li>the learning focus in teachers' interactions with children</li>
<li>their understanding and confidence in using the processes of self review.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Governance and management</h3>
<p>The kindergarten teachers, the children and their families are well supported by the association. The board has a positive relationship with the general manager who effectively and efficiently manages the operations of the kindergarten. As a team, she and the board have developed a useful strategic plan with a clear vision for the future with goals that align with the kindergarten's action plan. The general manager works with a education services manager to support the kindergarten to implement the high expectations they have for children's learning and wellbeing. This includes meeting the specific needs of children with a diverse range of needs.</p>
<p>The board and leaders have identified their next steps. They have planned to conduct a review of communication systems, including information technologies. A workshop has been planned to build on their understanding of the principles of The Treaty of Waitangi and how they apply within the organisation. The general manager and education services manager have begun to arrange further professional development for the association head teachers about leadership, self review and to develop a more robust system for the management of risk during kindergarten outings.</p>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Glen Warren Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p>
<p>The next ERO review of Glen Warren Kindergarten will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p>
<h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul>
<p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
