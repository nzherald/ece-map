</table><p>Kindercare Learning Centre Sawyers Arms (213) is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centre Sawyers Arms (213) is located in Harewood and is one of 12 early childhood education and care centres in Christchurch, owned and administered by Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd. The centre operates under the Kindercare philosophy, and management and accountability systems. An area manager works in partnership with the centre manager to guide the effective operation of each centre.</p><p>The centre caters for the education and care of children from birth to school age in four separate rooms. These rooms cater to the age, abilities and learning needs of each child. Each room has a spacious outside area that provides a range of activities and shared play spaces for children.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in September 2014, there have been a number of changes to staffing and leadership with the appointment of a new centre manager in 2016. Most teachers are qualified and registered. They are supported by a consistent group of relieving, mostly untrained, staff. An on-site cook provides nutritious vegetarian meals and snacks for children.</p><p>During this time of change, some recent progress has been made to address the recommendations from the last ERO report. The centre manager follows the Kindercare process for annual planning and self review. A curriculum leadership role has been created to help staff develop knowledge and use of new learning, assessment and evaluation processes. The centre manager has begun to implement a planned approach to ways of increasing understandings of bicultural perspectives and practices.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 12 Kindercare Learning Services reviewed in the Christchurch area in Term 1 2017. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Kindercare values of "love, safe, learning" are evident in centre practices and documentation. Leaders and staff foster warm, reciprocal relationships with children and families to help promote a good sense of belonging. Children play well with and alongside one another.</p><p>Children across the centre experience an inclusive environment. They have access to a wide range of learning activities that capture their curiosity and involvement in creative and imaginative play and exploration. Children with additional learning needs are well supported by leaders and staff who respond respectfully to them. Children have some opportunity to experience te reo and tikanga Māori.</p><p>Children under two years of age experience routines that are conducted in respectful ways and are aligned to parent preferences. They also experience a caring and calm environment and develop strong one-to-one relationships with teachers and staff, supported by the room's philosophy and its primary care system.</p><p>Parents have a range of ways to communicate with teachers and leaders about their child's learning. They receive good information and support with children who are transitioning into, within and beyond the centre. The centre has developed good links and regular interaction with the local primary school to help with the smooth transition process for children moving to school.</p><p>Teachers and staff build familiar relationships with children and use practices to engage children in a wide range of activities that allow them to explore, discover and follow their interests. Teachers are provided with targeted professional development to support teaching and play-based learning practices. The positive impact of professional development is helping to improve teacher capability.</p><p>Centre leaders have prioritised building relationships with teachers, parents, whānau and children. They seek regular parent input and respond, in a timely and appropriate manner. Centre leaders have identified the need for a new leadership structure across the centre and are in the process of appointing new team leaders for each room.</p><p>Service and centre leaders provide clear expectations and regular support and mentoring to help staff implement Kindercare management, curriculum, and health and safety systems. Leadership potential from within the centre is recognised and well supported by service managers through the induction processes. Leaders and teachers are at the early stages of working together to understand and make good use of self-review processes to extend on teaching practices and positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have identified, and ERO’s evaluation has confirmed, that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>increase bicultural awareness, te reo and tikanga Māori in the curriculum and routines</li>
<li>develop teacher capability to lead self review</li>
<li>implement and embed new processes for planning and assessment</li>
<li>continue to build leadership among the newly established leadership team. </li>
</ul><p>ERO has identified that the key next steps for Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd are to:</p><ul>
<li>give greater prominence to bicultural perspectives in key documentation</li>
<li>further develop strategic coverage of priorities and annual action planning and evaluation processes in centres</li>
<li>consider ways to strengthen partnerships in learning with schools</li>
<li>formalise and document the procedure for appraisal and attestation in the Christchurch area</li>
<li>evaluate how well current learning record practices allow children to revisit their own learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres - Sawyers Arms (213) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres - Sawyers Arms (213) will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern/Te Waipounamu</p><p>12 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service </h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
