</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Katikati Playcentre is located in Katikati in the northern Bay of Plenty. The playcentre is licensed to provide mixed-age education and care for 25 children, including a maximum of 12 children up to two years of age at any one time. It currently operates three morning sessions a week.</p><p>Katikati Playcentre operates under the umbrella of the Western Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association (WBOPPA). The parent-led cooperative benefits from the ongoing support and guidance of an experienced centre liaison officer and centre administration officer provided by the association. The WBOPPA also provides useful documentation and frameworks to guide centre training workshops and operations. These guidelines are underpinned by the association’s philosophy, which is highly evident in parents’ practice.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO report, the centre has made good progress in using self review and annual planning to improve aspects of centre operation, including the programme and environment. In 2014, enthusiastic parents raised community awareness of the service which resulted in an increase of new parent members. Many parents are currently involved in playcentre training modules and workshops run by the association.</p><p>ERO observed a session that is regularly supported by many parents with higher levels of playcentre training. The centre employs a member who has completed Course Three to support parents in training at other sessions.</p><p>Parents are committed to learning together with their children. They place priority on supporting children to become responsible, creative, problem solvers, who think for themselves and know that it is okay to ask for help.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six playcentre reviews in the Western Bay of Plenty Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children who attend the session observed by ERO, are capable, independent and enthusiastic learners. They confidently make choices, initiate play, and communicate well with each other and adults. Older children include younger siblings and toddlers in their play. Children enjoy trusting relationships and sustained dramatic and imaginative play with their friends. They make extensive use of a wide variety of interesting and thoughtfully presented equipment and materials to support their play. Toddlers know the routines and environment well, and confidently explore, experiment and direct their own learning. Children demonstrate a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>The programme that ERO observed was highly consistent with playcentre philosophy and responsive to children’s identified strengths and interests. Planning ensures a good balance of adult-planned and child-initiated activities. Parents enrich the programme by sharing their enthusiasm, knowledge and experience about gardening, the creative arts and farming with children. They demonstrate a strong commitment to biculturalism and continuing to increase the quality and consistency of their use of te reo Māori. This aspiration is strongly reflected in wall displays, centre resourcing and daily monitoring of the use of te reo Māori with children.</p><p>Parents regularly reflect on ways to improve planning, evaluation and assessment systems and processes. Individual portfolios record children’s participation in a rich variety of individual and group learning experiences. Parents’ involvement and dedication to playcentre training is contributing to ongoing improvement in the quality and consistency of programmes for young children.</p><p>ERO observed high-quality interactions amongst parents and children that nurture a love of learning. Adults know the children well. They are highly responsive to the diverse abilities and needs of individual children and celebrate their successes. Parents skilfully foster the development of social, language and thinking skills, mathematical concepts, and problem solving through rich conversations with children. Experienced adults model meaningful ways to integrate early literacy and mathematical concepts throughout the programme.</p><p>Parent members effectively share leadership responsibilities and decision making. They make good use of individual members’ knowledge, strengths and ideas to sustain centre management and operations. Parents understand the need for regular self review to ensure ongoing development and improvement. Emergent leadership is fostered through buddy systems to support parents to take on new roles, and to welcome and support new members. All parents are focused on providing positive outcomes for children and their families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that the next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to strengthen the quality of self review and annual action plans, and the links between them</li>
<li>make use of Ministry of Education guidelines and documents to enhance centre operation</li>
<li>use association and centre expertise to systematically build the overall confidence and ability of members to:</li>
<ul>
<li>use te reo Māori with the children</li>
<li>document children’s learning</li>
<li>identify, plan and support for children’s emerging learning and interests.</li>
</ul>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Katikati Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Katikati Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer-Northern Northern Region</p><p>27 February 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
