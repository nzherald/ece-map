</table><p>Meadowood Community Creche provides high quality early childhood education and care that promotes the wellbeing and learning of all children attending the crèche.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Meadowood Community Creche operates under the guidance of Meadowood House Incorporated. It is a non-profit community early childhood centre that provides sessional, mixed age education and care for more than 100 children a week. The centre is licensed for 25 children per session and operates with four qualified teachers. At present most children attend the centre only once or twice a week.</p><p>The philosophy for the centre is under review at present with the appointment of a new staff member this year. The original philosophy statement has been regularly updated to reflect the team's understanding of the values and aspirations that underpin and their guide practice. Parents are consulted about the philosophy statement before it is finalised.</p><p>The manager and the teachers together undertake the day-to-day management of the centre. They are supported by a parent committee. The manager reports monthly to the committee. The centre receives regular support from the committee chairperson.</p><p>The centre serves a diverse community and caters for a number of children with identified special needs. The teachers have developed good relationships with external support agencies.</p><p>Meadowood Community Creche has a positive reporting history with ERO. The 2012 ERO report noted the nurturing and respectful relationships between children and teachers, and the strong partnerships with parents. These positive features remain highly evident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Meadowood Community Creche provides high quality education and care for children in a calm, peaceful learning environment. Inclusive and respectful relationships with families and children support children's sense of belonging and wellbeing in the centre. Children play in friendly groups. Teachers work closely with children and foster independence and learning through play. They have authentic and meaningful conversations with children that help them to make decisions about their learning.</p><p>Children benefit from teachers' learning about Te Ao Māori, te reo and tikanga Māori. Teachers' use of te reo Māori in waiata, daily conversations and retelling of legends is working positively to support children's knowledge of, and connection with, New Zealand's dual cultural heritage. Children are beginning to use Māori words as part of play. Support and encouragement from Māori whānau has helped teachers to interweave into programmes a focus on manākitanga, wairuatanga, whanaungatanga and kaitiakitanga. The centre environment includes teachers' written affirmation of Te Tiriti o Waitangi as a formative document that supports their values.</p><p>Teachers intend continuing to learn about the values and cultures of their families with Pacific Nations heritage. They already ensure that centre practices affirm and support children from the Solomon and Cook Islands and Samoa. The centre's programmes demonstrate to children and their families that their cultures are valued and important. Teachers use some words in children's home languages. They are also adept at using Makaton signing and gesture to communicate when children have English as an additional language. The environment reflects the varied cultures of the families using the centre.</p><p>Curriculum design and implementation are led effectively. Teachers' assessment is purposeful, and continues to grow in depth and understanding. Professional reflection linking assessment and planning has helped teachers to maintain quality programmes for individual children. Many parents comment in their children's portfolios about children's learning and adventures at home. Frequent sharing of information helps teachers to set learning goals based on parent's aspirations.</p><p>Teachers' planning is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. They promote children's rights to learning and play. This has helped them to develop a quality programme for infants and toddlers. Teachers work effectively alongside the families of children with diverse needs. The strong focus on inclusion and respect makes this an affirming environment for all children.</p><p>Children use literacy, numeracy and science concepts and thinking in their play. Teachers support children to develop this foundational knowledge by providing appropriate resources and support.</p><p>Management systems are well established and efficient. Strategic and annual planning are linked, and contribute to planning for the programme. Performance management procedures are regularly undertaken. This helps teachers and managers to select and provide appropriate professional development. The employment of an administrative assistant has helped to ensure that documentation and review is timely and efficiently organised.</p><p>The long-serving and dedicated manager provides strong leadership, mentoring and guidance for staff. She manages the centre calmly, supporting emergent leadership and collegiality. She also provides opportunities for families and children to take some leadership roles. The centre is well poised to continue to maintain and improve its high quality provision for children and families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre management agree that the next key steps for the centre are to; continue refining and developing the planning cycle, improve their understanding about Pacific Island cultures and complete the philosophy statement consultation.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Meadowood Community Creche completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Meadowood Community Creche will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>5 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services.</a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
