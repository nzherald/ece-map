<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Greenwood Kindergarten continues to develop its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children. Progress is well supported by good governance from the association and guidance from the Senior Education Adviser.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Greenwood Kindergarten provides education and care for up to 45 children, five mornings per week. An extended six hour day is offered three days per week. The teaching team is recently established, with a new head teacher. The kindergarten community has received a healthy heart award for its focus on healthy eating. A family liaison group assists with fundraising and facilitates a range of social occasions for parents.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Nelson Kindergarten Association (the association) and overseen by a team of Senior Education Advisors (SEAs). The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in eight early childhood education services within the Nelson Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are warm, welcoming, responsive and respectful. Children confidently approach them to ask questions or share their ideas. Children's sense of belonging is actively en couraged. Teachers understand the importance of relationships. They capitalise on opportunities to draw on parent expertise and use this knowledge to support the programme to be culturally responsive.</p><p>Children make choices, follow their interests in play and work collaboratively with others. Teachers organise the learning environment to encourage children&rsquo;s curiosity and sustained engagement. At times, teachers draw on a range of useful strategies to support children in their play.</p><p>Routines are consistently implemented giving children a sense of security in being able to predict what will happen next. The curriculum is clearly linked to the principles and strands of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Teachers articulate a belief in inclusive education and where appropriate, liaise with external agencies. Equity funding is used appropriately to support children&rsquo;s learning and development.</p><p>Teachers are highly committed to implementing a bicultural programme. Te reo M&#257;ori is used appropriately during routine times. This should be further strengthened through teachers integrating te reo me ng&#257; tik&#257;nga M&#257;ori throughout the curriculum. Teachers should also formally investigate what success for M&#257;ori children might look like at Greenwood Kindergarten.</p><p>Effective processes assist children and their families to transition to school. Positive relationships with local schools are evident and a range of informative information is available to parents.</p><p>Group planning is thematic with a strong focus on sustainability. The enviroschools focus is integrated throughout the curriculum and the kindergarten community has achieved a silver award. Planning should be strengthened through regular evaluation to inform future programmes and the impact on learning. Children&rsquo;s portfolios are well presented. These highlight children&rsquo;s interests, skills and approach to learning.</p><p>Teachers are reflective practitioners who engage in research based teaching. This commitment to ongoing learning is reflected through the experiences offered to children. Teachers are supported in their understanding of self review by the association. There is strong alignment between the guiding documents of the association and kindergarten and the resulting review. Spontaneous review has been well used to improve outcomes for children. Teachers and the association are highly consultative, regularly requesting and receiving feedback from their parent community. The association has effectively led robust review and evaluation using a collaborative approach.</p><p>The association provides high levels of guidance and support for teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>clear guiding documents</li>
<li>expectations for programme delivery and kindergarten operations, including health and safety practices</li>
<li>access to a wide range of professional learning and development opportunities.</li>
</ul><p>The association has recently updated its appraisal procedures to provide clear guidance to staff. Leaders are engaging in ongoing professional learning in this area to support its successful implementation.</p><p>The SEA regularly visits the kindergarten and provides support and leadership to the teaching team. Through SEA guidance and identified next steps teachers are well supported to provide positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the quality of the interactions by drawing on a wider range of strategies to develop children&rsquo;s thinking and reasoning abilities</li>
<li>explore strategies and approaches to support the development of children&rsquo;s social and emotional competence</li>
<li>show through the assessment documentation how depth and complexity has been added to children&rsquo;s learning to more effectively highlight progress overtime</li>
<li>continue to build the evaluative capacity of teachers to systematically enquire into and judge the effectiveness of their kindergarten operations. This should assist future decision-making and identify priorities to further enhance children&rsquo;s learning and wellbeing.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Greenwood Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>21 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues.
