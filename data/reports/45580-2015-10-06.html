</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Cubbyhouse Childcare Centre (Palmerston North) is a purpose built, privately owned centre. The service is licensed for 130 children, including 35 up to two years, in three age-appropriate learning areas.</p><p>The two directors of the services provide governance and ongoing management support to the centre manager who oversees the day-to-day operation of the centre and is responsible for building professional practice. Four team leaders guide curriculum implementation, assessment and evaluation practice.</p><p>The centre manager and team leaders all hold practising certificates. Three staff are provisionally registered and involved in ongoing mentoring as they work toward full teacher registration status.</p><p>In September 2013 ERO undertook the first review of this centre and signalled a return within two years. ERO indentified management needed to improve centre systems, leadership, and teaching and learning practices in order to meet the regulatory requirements and promote more positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Centre management, with the Ministry of Education, formulated a development plan to address key issues. External support, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO), contributes to improved centre practices, management, leadership and teacher capability.</p><p>Centre systems and processes have improved significantly. The priority for development continues to be strengthening the leadership of teaching to provide a more consistent delivery of the curriculum for all children. Managers and teachers have recently strengthened their supervision and security processes and practices in relation to children’s safety.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive practices identified in the previous ERO report have been sustained. These include practices that nurture infants and toddlers. Constancy of caregiver supports their need for strong and secure attachments. Teaching is based on sound philosophies and current thinking about best practice for younger children. Key primary caregivers build relationships with children and whānau, encourage a sense of belonging, and a calm setting for the youngest children.</p><p>Parents, teachers and children have collaboratively developed the centre philosophy. A shared vision and strategic direction have been established. This promotes a common understanding among leaders and teachers of the centre’s vision and goals. A sound guiding document is in place.</p><p>The incorporation of te ao Māori in the programme has been enhanced as a result of increased teacher knowledge, confidence and comprehensive self review. Attractive and spacious learning environments provide children with many opportunities to explore and investigate.</p><p>Leaders and teachers continue to develop assessment practices. Planning and assessments are beginning to show the progression of children’s learning over time, making this and teaching practices more visible. It is timely to review group learning experiences to ensure they are responsive to all children’s strengths, interests and needs.</p><p>The recent introduction of e-portfolios is improving parent access to information about their child, leading to greater whānau participation and feedback. Parents’ aspirations are valued.</p><p>Systems are now in place, particularly through appraisal, to build teacher and leader capacity. Management’s use and understanding of <em>Tātaiako:</em> <em>Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori</em> <em>Learners</em> and the ERO early childhood review framework, <em>Ngā Pou Here</em>, is positively impacting on the quality of teaching and children’s learning.</p><p>Leadership opportunities are shared across centre staff. Externally facilitated professional learning and development (SELO) is strengthening teachers’ skills and confidence to lead. Leaders plan to engage a private facilitator to further improve centre leadership practices.</p><p>Teachers are reflective practitioners and a strong focus on continual improvement is evident. Processes are being developed for the induction of new teachers and the use of inquiry to support provisionally registered teachers. However, leaders and ERO agree that appraisal still requires strengthening to ensure consistency of effective teaching practice.</p><p>Steady progress continues against the service’s development plan and contributes to improved governance and management. Self review for improvement is better understood and several useful reviews have been undertaken. This foundation work positions leaders well to prioritise developments, monitor progress and increase the quality of service provision. Developing the use of review and evaluation, particularly in relation to the development plan, remains a focus.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified the centre should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>review group learning experiences</li>
<li>develop centre leadership</li>
<li>embed robust teacher appraisal and for improving teaching practices based on the centre philosophy</li>
<li>improve review and evaluation, particularly in relation to gauging the impact of the centre development plan on improving outcomes for children and their families.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Cubbyhouse Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Cubbyhouse Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>6 October 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
