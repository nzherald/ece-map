<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Paeroa is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Paeroa, services the local community and surrounding rural areas. It provides education and care for up to 40 children over two years of age of whom a high percentage are of M&#257;ori descent. It is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday 8.45 a.m. to 2.45 p.m., and on Wednesday 8.30 a.m. to 12.45 p.m.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella organisation, Central North Island Kindergarten Trust (Trust), previously known as Central North Island Kindergarten Association. The Trust provides the kindergarten with clear guidance and expectations for practice and strategic direction. A knowledgeable and experienced professional leader oversees the quality of the service and supports Paeroa staff.</p><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s whakatauki is <em>&lsquo;Toro atu to ringa, kei reira te oranga mo tatou te tangata&rsquo;</em> (to teach is to reach out and touch the hands, hearts and the minds of tomorrow), and underpins a shared teaching philosophy for quality education and care. Teachers place an emphasis on developing:</p><ul>
<li>children&rsquo;s learning dispositions (attitudes that support their learning)</li>
<li>strong relationships with wh&#257;nau, children, outside educational services and the wider community.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are committed to bicultural practices and acknowledge M&#257;ori as tangata whenua. They utilise community expertise and share their own educational knowledge to advocate for children&rsquo;s education and care. Children benefit from positive partnerships in learning.</p><p>The kindergarten has a positive ERO reporting history and teachers have kept up-to-date with current practices through ongoing and relevant professional development and self review.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in eleven early childhood education services within the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The high-quality education and care programme is responsive to the diverse interests, strengths and abilities of the children. It is inclusive and enables all children to fully participate in kindergarten experiences, including outings in the local and wider community. Children enjoy learning and are developing as self-managing learners.</p><p>Children are highly engaged in sustained and meaningful play. Skilled teachers allow children space and time for their learning within a well-organised and resourced environment. They interact skilfully with children to encourage and foster their ability to:</p><ul>
<li>problem solve, extend their thinking and build deeper understandings</li>
<li>develop behaviours and attitudes that support social development</li>
<li>discuss their learning using descriptive language</li>
<li>embrace te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori.</li>
</ul><p>Strong friendships contribute to children&rsquo;s wellbeing, cooperative play and learning interactions with their peers and adults. Children have opportunities to be leaders and mentor others (tuakana-teina relationships).</p><p>Strong relationships are underpinned by the concepts of whanaungatanga and manaakitanga, (partnerships and relationships with genuine care and respect). Parents and wh&#257;nau feel welcome, spend time with their children and participate in their learning. They are well informed and are knowledgeable about their child&rsquo;s interests and learning. Child profiles are highly valued document that show children&rsquo;s learning and progress. These are well used by teachers, children and parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>The head teacher provides sound professional leadership. She models good leadership and teaching practices. She encourages staff to lead initiatives and share their strengths. Teachers have a deep knowledge of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, (the early childhood curriculum). They effectively implement this through the context of their philosophy and robust self-review processes. ERO affirms teachers&rsquo; next steps in supporting all aspects of children's&rsquo; learning and their intention to continue professional learning to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Paeroa completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>14 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
