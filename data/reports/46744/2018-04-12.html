</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wee Nippers Mosgiel is a new, purpose-built centre with four classrooms and a spacious outdoor area. The centre opened in August 2015, providing full-day care and education for over 100 children. This is the centre's first ERO review. The centre is one of two privately owned centres under the Wee Nippers name.</p><p>A manager has overall control of the day-to-day running of the centre and has strong support from the two owners. The centre has a new teaching team, comprising a mix of experienced and beginner teachers, 10 of whom are fully qualified. The centre chef provides all meals throughout the day. The centre has gained the Gold Healthy Heart Award.</p><p>The centre philosophy is that children learn and develop where they are challenged to explore and be curious.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive, inclusive relationships are evident across the centre. Children benefit from respectful, caring and thoughtful interactions between each other and their teachers. They are confident to approach adults. Teachers feel appreciated and valued by their manager and the owners. Leaders provide strong support for teachers’ professional learning and are mindful of their wellbeing. Centre parents and teachers have worked closely to build trusting, collaborative partnerships that focus on children's wellbeing and learning.</p><p>Children take part in a wide range of learning experiences. They are encouraged to be independent and to self-manage. The centre environment effectively provides children with variety and challenge. Teachers gather parents’ aspirations for their children’s learning and respond to these. Teachers plan relevant activities that foster learning and development for individual children and small groups. They know children in their care well and record children’s learning and dispositions in learning stories. They are increasingly integrating te reo and tikanga Māori into the daily learning programme. Children with particular learning needs are well supported and are included in the life of the centre.</p><p>Transitions for children into, within and beyond the centre are well managed. This gives the children and their parents confidence and security as they make changes. The teachers and manager have established useful connections with local schools to support this.</p><p>A suitable strategic plan guides the direction for the future and highlights the centre's priorities for development. These include:</p><ul>
<li>provision for professional development to enhance teaching skills</li>
<li>the growth of leadership skills amongst teachers so that in the future head teachers may be appointed for each room</li>
<li>ensuring the centre continues to be well resourced so that the carefully designed environment remains a vital catalyst for children's learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has found, and the centre leaders agree, that the following next steps would strengthen how well the valued outcomes for children's learning are achieved. These include:</p><ul>
<li>fully implementing the appraisal process</li>
<li>strengthening internal evaluation by using a more evaluative approach</li>
<li>strengthening the assessment process by ensuring learning stories more consistently show how teachers intend to extend children’s learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wee Nippers Mosgiel Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Wee Nippers Mosgiel Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</p><p>12 April 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
