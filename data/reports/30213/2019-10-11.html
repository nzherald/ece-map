</table><p>PORSE Wellington S5 is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>PORSE Wellington S5, previously known as PORSE Lower Hutt S1, is a home-based education and care network operating under the umbrella of PORSE In-Home Childcare (NZ) Ltd (the organisation). It is licensed for 80 children including 80 aged up to two. Of the 66 children currently enrolled, 11 are Māori children.</p><p>Since the April 2015 ERO report the organisation had had two changes of ownership. In 2015 it was sold to Evolve Education Group Ltd. In late 2018 it was purchased by Rainbow Group. There have been significant changes to leadership positions in community teams.  A newly established role of curriculum and quality assurance coach supports the work of the national coach.</p><p>In this network four programme tutors, who are qualified and registered teachers, work alongside educators to assist them to implement care and learning programmes for children in homes. Programme tutors are supported by peer coaches. A regional coach reports to the senior leadership team.</p><p>Two options for care and education are offered; the home educator model where educators work in their own home, and the nanny educator model where an educator works in the family’s home. In this network some educators have New Zealand Qualifications Authority-approved Level 3 qualifications in early childhood education and care.</p><p>The organisation’s vision is ‘expanding the hearts, minds and wellbeing of a nation through nurturing childcare in-home’. The current philosophy guiding teaching and learning highlights ‘natural childcare’ and an increased emphasis on authentic relationships, environments and learning experiences.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified that improvement was required in the organisation's monitoring systems, including those for health and safety, curriculum planning, including Māori perspectives, appraisal, and internal evaluation. Good progress has been made in some areas, however aspects of some remain next steps for improvement.</p><p>This review was one of 11 networks in PORSE In-Home Childcare (NZ) Ltd, Wellington region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have opportunities to participate in a wide range of learning experiences in educators' homes and the local community. Many attend PORSE-organised playschools, music groups and excursions. These provide children with appropriate challenges and opportunities to socialise with peers.</p><p>Educators are well supported through regular visits and communication with programme tutors. There is a strong focus on ensuring compliance requirements are met.</p><p>There is a comprehensive and well–considered process to support children’s enrolment and transition into educator homes. This helps children to settle and develop a sense of belonging and security. Emerging interests are encouraged and achievements celebrated. Educators are attentive to the care needs for infants and toddlers.</p><p>Educators are well supported through the regular visits and communication with programme tutors. These have a strong focus on ensuring compliance requirements are met. Variability in the quality of programme tutor and educator practice is evident. Programme tutors should strengthen educators’ practice to be more responsive to children’s learning needs and parent aspirations. Next steps are to strengthen the assessment and planning documentation to better reflect <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and clearly identify children’s learning outcomes.</p><p>Programme tutors have access to a range of information and knowledge about external agencies which enables them to support children with complex or additional learning needs.</p><p>The organisation has increased their focus on the provision of a bicultural programme. This is supported through a range of useful workshops and resources. Programme tutors and educators are exploring ways to better integrate aspects of te ao Māori into the programmes. At times programme tutors work collaboratively to enhance Treaty of Waitangi based practices and to encourage greater understanding and use of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori.</p><p>Appropriate processes are in place to appraise programme tutors. Plans are in place to develop a more inquiry based approach. This along with more clearly articulated goals should make the process more meaningful for teachers. Guiding documents require further development.</p><p>The quality of the appraisal process for educators is variable. Support for appraisers to implement a more development-based approach to strengthen educators' knowledge of <em>Te Whāriki</em> is required.</p><p>The organisation should continue to develop the understanding and use of internal evaluation. Programme tutors regularly carry out reviews aligned to organisational priorities; however their approach requires improvement. This should include more systematic gathering, analysis and interpretation of evidence to guide decision-making.</p><p>The organisation at all levels should continue to develop the understanding and use of internal evaluation. Programme tutors regularly carry out reviews aligned to organisational priorities, however their approach requires improvement. This should include more systematic gathering, analysis and interpretation of evidence to guide decision-making.</p><p>A well organised governance and management framework guides operation and practice. Reporting lines and responsibilities are clear. Quality assurance is prioritised, effective and well implemented. The organisation has a comprehensive range of up-to-date guidelines and management support to guide programme tutors and educators to successfully undertake their roles. New owners have determined that the existing philosophy and strategic priorities will be reviewed. This is timely given the recent changes to the organisation.</p><p>The newly appointed regional coach works collaboratively with her team to provide responsive support and promote improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for organisation managers are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>build Treaty of Waitangi based practice in systems and processes</li>
<li>develop curriculum priorities and desired outcomes for children’s learning to align with <em>Te Whāriki </em>and the aspirations parents, families and whānau have for their children</li>
<li>revise the philosophy to reflect national and regional priorities</li>
<li>provide professional development to build capability for support coaches and programme tutors</li>
<li>develop shared understandings and effective use of internal evaluation to improve outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Network leaders and programme tutors should:</p><ul>
<li>further develop consistent and effective practices for planning and assessment that better align with the learning outcomes of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum</li>
<li>strengthen processes for providing ongoing feedback to educators to improve their practice</li>
<li>work with educators to evaluate the impact of planned strategies and experiences in supporting desired outcomes for learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of PORSE Wellington S5 completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice the service provider should:</p><ul>
<li>ensure all educators are supported by a suitable appraisal process.</li>
</ul><p>Dr Lesley Patterson<br> Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini<br>Southern Region</p><p>11 October 2019 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 621px;">

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework Ngā Pou Here:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed</li>
<li>Well placed</li>
<li>Requires further development</li>
<li>Not well placed</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
