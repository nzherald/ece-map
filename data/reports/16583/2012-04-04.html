<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Tikipunga Playcentre is a well established centre in Whangarei that operates as part of the Northland Playcentre Association. The Association provides a comprehensive adult education programme and a framework of policies and procedures to support centre members.</p><p>Since the last ERO report in 2007, there have been many changes in families attending. The centre has been relicensed under the 2008 licensing criteria, and there have been improvements to the environment and an ongoing commitment to Playcentre education training. Centre members know each other well and continue to be supportive and respectful of each other in the education and care of their children.</p><p>Centre members provide a good quality programme based on Playcentre philosophy. They value and support child-initiated play and are responsive to children&rsquo;s ideas and choices. Adults integrate aspects of literacy, numeracy and science into the programme and nurture children&rsquo;s creativity Te reo and tikanga Maori are included in centre practices and in the programme. Children and adults show enthusiasm for learning through play and a shared sense of purpose.</p><p>Children are confident, play cooperatively, and display a strong sense of belonging. They are busy, have fun and their learning is supported by well resourced play areas. The attractive outdoor area provides children with many opportunities for physical activity and imaginative play. Children eagerly engage in art and messy play activities. Infants and toddlers have access to all areas of the centre and adults cater well for their developmental needs.</p><p>The centre is managed cooperatively and effectively by the centre members. Robust self review underpins transparent decision making and guides ongoing improvements. Centre members and ERO agree that parents and wh&#257;nau should continue to develop and review strategies to enrich and deepen children&rsquo;s learning experiences.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Tikipunga Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atTikipunga Playcentre.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Tikipunga Playcentre is well established. It is managed cooperatively by the parents and wh&#257;nau of children enrolled. The centre practices are based on the Playcentre philosophy of families learning and growing together. It is open for three sessions each week.</p><p>The respectful and responsive interactions between adults and children noted in the 2007 ERO report have continued. Enthusiastic and proactive centre leadership and Association support contribute to the sustainability and success of this centre. The centre has recently been relicensed under the 2008 licensing criteria.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><em>Programme implementation.</em> Parents/wh&#257;nau provide a play-based programme underpinned by Playcentre philosophy. They value child-initiated play and ensure the programme is responsive to children&rsquo;s development and preferences. Centre members provide</p><ul>
<li>a wide range of learning experiences in a well resourced, carefully organised environment</li>
<li>good support for children to explore and make discoveries</li>
<li>encouragement for children to make choices and try out new activities</li>
<li>support for adults in their dual role as parent educator, both in and out of the centre.</li>
</ul><p>Centre members&rsquo; commitment to biculturalism is reflected in displays, appropriate resources and an increasing use of te reo Maori.</p><p><em>Participation in play.</em> Children are confident young learners. They are creative, curious and eager to learn. Adults provide extra resources, support and affirmation to foster sustained play. Children play sociably with their peers, are inclusive of younger children and happily join in group activities. They are developing independence, positive attitudes to learning and an awareness of the world around them.</p><p><em>Younger children.</em> Centre members ensure that the youngest children are well provided for in the programme. In-depth self review of the provison for infants and toddlers has resulted in a cosy area for infants with a wide variety of age appropriate resources. Centre members are aware of research and good practice in the education of infants. They encourage toddlers to explore a wide variety of activities and ensure they have opportunities to develop their physical skills. Centre members support each other in the care of each other&rsquo;s children. Infants and toddlers are confident and trusting with adults and are developing useful strategies for playing positively with other children.</p><p><em>Playcentre philosophy.</em> Centre members model Playcentre philosophy. Their commitment to biculturalism is evident in centre practices and welcoming processes. They show a genuine respect for each child and its family. Experienced centre members and Association personnel share their knowledge with new members and encourage emergent leadership. A general enthusiasm for Playcentre training reflects adults&rsquo; commitment to taking an active role in their children&rsquo;s education. All parents and wh&#257;nau are encouraged to be involved and all contributions are valued. Good administration of the centre and a shared sense of purpose enable sessions to focus on supporting children&rsquo;s play.</p><p><em>Planning and assessment.</em> Centre members have developed good systems of planning to guide the programme. Assessment information shows children engaged in play and group experiences. Planning reflects Playcentre philosophy, theories of learning and links to Te Whariki, the early childhood curriculum. Children&rsquo;s individual assessment portfolios are contributed to by a variety of adults and are used to revisit children&rsquo;s learning and development.</p><p><em>Self review.</em> Self-review processes are well developed, used effectively and evident in centre operations and programme implementation. Parents and wh&#257;nau engage in informal and formal self review to improve learning experiences for children. They regularly review the annual and strategic plan. The good quality programme implementation and stimulating learning environment reflect adults&rsquo; careful consideration of ongoing improvements. Such reflection has resulted in the development of a collegial, responsive and improvement-focused teaching team.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p><em>Extending challenges.</em> Centre members could increase the use of strategies that extend the learning embedded in child-initiated play and build on what children already know. They could also, more consistently:</p><ul>
<li>encourage children&rsquo;s greater use of literacy and numeracy in the context of play</li>
<li>make each play area more complex for older children</li>
<li>maximise leadership opportunities for children</li>
<li>make the extension of children&rsquo;s individual interests more evident in planning.</li>
</ul><p>Centre members identified that continuing the growth in trained parent educators is an area to develop.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Tikipunga Playcentre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-tikipunga-playcentre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Tikipunga Playcentre</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Tikipunga Playcentre.</p><p>Tikipunga Playcentre is a well established centre in Whangarei that operates as part of the Northland Playcentre Association. The Association provides a comprehensive adult education programme and a framework of policies and procedures to support centre members.</p><p>Since the last ERO report in 2007, there have been many changes in families attending. The centre has been relicensed under the 2008 licensing criteria, and there have been improvements to the environment and an ongoing commitment to Playcentre education training. Centre members know each other well and continue to be supportive and respectful of each other in the education and care of their children.</p><p>Centre members provide a good quality programme based on Playcentre philosophy. They value and support child-initiated play and are responsive to children&rsquo;s ideas and choices. Adults integrate aspects of literacy, numeracy and science into the programme and nurture children&rsquo;s creativity Te reo and tikanga Maori are included in centre practices and in the programme. Children and adults show enthusiasm for learning through play and a shared sense of purpose.</p><p>Children are confident, play cooperatively, and display a strong sense of belonging. They are busy, have fun and their learning is supported by well resourced play areas. The attractive outdoor area provides children with many opportunities for physical activity and imaginative play. Children eagerly engage in art and messy play activities. Infants and toddlers have access to all areas of the centre and adults cater well for their developmental needs.</p><p>The centre is managed cooperatively and effectively by the centre members. Robust self review underpins transparent decision making and guides ongoing improvements. Centre members and ERO agree that parents and wh&#257;nau should continue to develop and review strategies to enrich and deepen children&rsquo;s learning experiences.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
