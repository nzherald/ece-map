</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wakatipu Kindergarten is located in central Queenstown and close to the local primary school. Children come from a variety of countries and cultures.</p><p>The kindergarten is licensed for 45 children from 3-5 years of age. Daily sessions are from 8:30am to 2:45pm. Children may attend a range of sessions. Some children attend several different early childhood services.</p><p>Children play and learn in well-designed, attractive and spacious inside and outside areas. The kindergarten is well resourced allowing for children to make choices about their play.</p><p>The head teacher is long serving and the teaching team has been together for five years. In response to the 2010 ERO report teachers have worked hard to develop aspects of self review, planning and assessment.</p><p>The parent committee provides substantial financial support to make improvements to the physical environment. Recent building renovations and additions include a children’s library and a technology area, administration office and whānau room.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Central Otago Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from caring relationships with their teachers. They are confident to approach teachers and seek help. Children have good friendships with each other and play well in small and larger groups for sustained periods of time.</p><p>The teachers interact with children in positive and responsive ways. This helps the children to settle into kindergarten. Teachers are respectful and listen carefully to support children’s play and learning. They have a strong focus on ensuring children’s culture and language is acknowledged. They sensitively support children and their families. For example, they have helped a child to send daily emails to a mum in hospital and fundraised for families in the Philippines.</p><p>They welcome family/whānau contributions and participation. Teachers consider children’s family situations and home life. As some families do not have wider family support locally, teachers find ways to share what children are doing and learning with extended family outside New Zealand.</p><p>ERO observed teachers skilfully working with and alongside children. They see children as competent and able learners. They provide strategies for children to play cooperatively, solve problems and overcome conflicts together. There are many opportunities for children to develop their independence and communication skills.</p><p>Children choose from a range of interesting learning experiences. Teachers provide good quality learning opportunities such as:</p><ul>
<li>literacy and numeracy activities which are well integrated throughout the programme</li>
<li>a range of activities for developing children’s physical skills</li>
<li>celebrating children’s and their families’ cultures, like Japanese girls’ day</li>
<li>dramatic play where children use their imagination and role play</li>
<li>the use of waiata, karakia, kai and learning about local legends</li>
<li>a buddy programme with a local school.</li>
</ul><p>A strength of the kindergarten is the increasing use of information and ICT. Children have easy access to a number of iPads, laptops, computers and digital cameras. Teachers help children to make movies and write story books using these technologies. There are strong links between home and the kindergarten through the use of ICT.</p><p>Teachers plan and assess effectively to meet and monitor ongoing and changing needs, interests and strengths of individuals and small groups of children. They seek and respond to parents’ wishes for their children’s learning and development. Children’s goals are well displayed so that all teachers know what to focus on for individual children. The kindergarten’s philosophy of building children’s knowledge, skills and attitudes is clearly evident in what teachers do with and for children.</p><p>Teachers work effectively as a team. They reflect on their practices to continually improve what happens for children. The head teacher knows teachers’ strengths well and works to use and extend these for the benefit of all. She has developed efficient systems to manage teachers’ workload and the smooth running of the kindergarten. Teachers use self review to make positive changes and to improve their practices.</p><h4>Governance</h4><p>Over the past three years the Central Otago Kindergarten Association has gone through an unsettled period. There has been a break down in governance, management and systems which has adversely affected the effectiveness and level of leadership provided to each kindergarten. This has led to the board contracting Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association (trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens) in 2012 to undertake an independent review of the management structure. Then in September 2013, Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association was contacted again to provide management support and guidance in an effort to establish robust systems, competent leadership and management. The process for redevelopment is still underway and new systems are being established and at the time of this review, ERO found it was too early to tell how well they would be implemented. Overall, there has been a substantial turnover of teachers within the Association. ERO also found that the appraisal process was not robust and needs further development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>A further enhancement to current good practice would be for teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen their self-review practices</li>
<li>increase the depth of their bicultural practices.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have identified that a next step for them is to make more use of the significant features of the local environment to extend and enrich children’s learning. ERO agrees with this.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wakatipu Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Wakatipu Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>26 June 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
