</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bear Park Early Childhood Centre is one of a chain of Bear Park Ltd services. All of the Bear Park centres are led by the Bear Park Franchisor and the Bear Park pedagogical team. An interlinking set of policies, procedures and systems guides the centres and provides continuity and reassurance about the quality of these services.</p><p>This centre operates in an historic home on a large property. The interior has been modified to provide suitable spaces for children's play. The centre caters for 50 children, 12 of whom are up to two years of age. It serves families who live and work in the surrounding suburbs and businesses, many of whom are Chinese.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is the over-arching statement prepared for Bear Park centres. It refers to the inspiration taken from the values and beliefs of the Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education. The philosophy is strongly linked to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers of the infants and toddlers follow influences of the Resources for Infant Educators (RIE) philosophy. Day to day management of the centre is shared by the teachers, all of whom are qualified.</p><p>As noted in the 2013 ERO report, teachers continue to develop bicultural practices and the use of te reo Māori in programmes.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three early childhood centre reviews in the Bear Park Childcare Centres organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed at the start of their day and settle well into their respective groups. Teachers are respectful and appreciative of families' cultures and share information about children, sometimes with the help of interpreters. Important cultural festivals are celebrated with families.</p><p>Children are grouped according to age in designated rooms and with teams of familiar teachers. They make choices about their play for periods during the day and enjoy friendships and the company of others. Sometimes infants and toddlers have opportunities to mix with the older children in the playground. This encourages a good sense of tuakana/teina relationships, with older children setting an example for those younger than themselves.</p><p>Teachers have had a focus on broadening their professional knowledge through both national and international opportunities for learning and development. This focus continues this year with courses that teachers have been selected to attend. It results in a strong underpinning of Reggio inspirations that guide teachers' thinking about ways of provoking children's learning.</p><p>Teachers provide many opportunities for children to explore, investigate and test their own theories and those promoted by teachers. There are also many opportunities for children to discuss their activities and make decisions. Meeting times with children during the day are increasingly about children sharing their ideas. They help to strengthen children's confidence and support their in-depth study of selected topics.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are settled and calm in their attractive and peaceful environment. Teachers work closely with them, including them in small games and opportunities to explore. Children respond to their affection and attention with trust. Special attention is paid to children's beginning language and non-verbal cues. Routines are planned to align with children's home routines and are engaging times for these children. The day includes opportunities for infants and toddlers to be outdoors for prolonged periods, and to make choices about their play.</p><p>The room environments are beautifully arranged to provoke children's exploration and include high quality natural resources. Teachers carefully consider ways of supporting children's literacy and numeracy knowledge through easily available, interesting resources. Teachers provide resources to allow children to elaborate their play and to develop collaborative and negotiated games.</p><p>Children have good opportunities for physically challenging play. The outdoor areas include a secluded and pleasant garden for the younger children and a more spacious and exciting playground for the older children. Children help to maintain and care for the environment as part of the everyday programmes.</p><p>Parents have many opportunities to talk to teachers about their children. Twice yearly formal meetings and day-to-day conversations that enable teachers to respond to these in programme planning. The formation of a representative parent committee has increased parent participation in the review of policies and procedures, and in decision making about the programmes.</p><p>There has been a strong focus throughout Bear Park on increasing teachers' understanding of and knowledge about bicultural practices. This has included many opportunities for teachers who are more competent and confident in te ao Māori to share with and mentor their peers. There have also been opportunities for professional learning and development from external speakers. This has made a significant difference to the amount of te reo Māori spoken and the recognition of tikanga Māori in the Bear Park centres.</p><p>Teacher keep extensive documentation about children, the programme and self review. Some of this documentation is linked to the over-arching four year strategic plan. This enables teachers each month to review the ways in which they meet strategic goals. Teachers may find it useful, as part of regular strategic plan review, to continue to deepen their focus on ways to enhance teaching and learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The recently formed pedagogical team, which includes the owner, provides ongoing support and advice for centres. The team meets regularly to discuss and make decisions about professional development and centre progress. This team sets the direction for the organisation and supports development. The management team recruits, manages and develops teachers' competency well. The strategic placement of teachers ensures support and stronger teamwork to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers agree that the focus of ongoing critical reflection could include placing a stronger, more meaningful emphasis on supporting bicultural practices in the centre.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bear Park Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bear Park Early Childhood Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>23 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
