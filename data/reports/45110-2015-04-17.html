</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bright Horizons Drury is located in a semi-rural setting near Auckland’s southern motorway in Drury. The centre is licensed to provide full day and school length day education and care sessions for 46 children, including 24 up to the age of two years. The centre has a small number of Māori families. Children from Dutch, British and Chinese families also attend. Children with specific learning abilities are well supported in the programme. The centre prides itself on building relationships with families and the wider community.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy has a focus on collaborative relationships encouraging children’s exploration, independence, and confidence, and programmes planned to extending children’s individual and group interests.</p><p>The centre is one of two centres that are privately owned by an Australian early childhood organisation, Bright Horizons New Zealand Childcare Limited. A regional manager oversees the centre and works closely with the centre director, who is supported in the day-to-day running of the centre by the head teacher.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report suggested that the following areas could continue to be strengthened by:</p><ul>
<li>recording how teachers intend to build on children’s individual interests, capabilities and cultural heritages</li>
<li>increasing the visibility of planning documents for children and parents</li>
<li>enriching the learning environments by providing a greater selection of resources and experiences to challenge children’s learning.</li>
</ul><p>The 2012 ERO report noted that the centre managers intended to continue to strengthen self-review practices. ERO also recommended that long term plans be developed to guide the future development of the centre and that action plans be developed to address priorities. Managers and teachers have responded positively to ERO’s recommendations and have implemented improvements.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are friendly, articulate and are developing sound social skills. They manage their own care routines capably and are developing self-help skills. Consideration and empathy for others are evident in the centre. Respect and trust underpin relationships.</p><p>Younger children are supported by teachers to develop at their own pace and to build their language proficiency. Older children are developing good communication skills and readily express their opinions and ideas to each other and with teachers. All children display a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing.</p><p>Teachers know the children and their families well. They are aware of individual children’s strengths and abilities. Teachers provide opportunities for children to revisit their learning experiences. Programme plans are clearly displayed and show how teachers are providing activities and experiences to extend learning. Many parents share their specialist knowledge and expertise with children in the programme.</p><p>The learning environments have been improved and children have access to a wide range of resources. Teachers are able to adapt the programme and learning environments to support children’s new interests.</p><p>Teacher appraisal systems have been improved. The system enables managers and teachers to reflect on agreed goals more frequently. It also has the potential to strengthen teachers’ leadership skills, professional knowledge and practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers agree that it would be useful to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop tikanga and te reo Māori in the programme</li>
<li>continue to encourage staff to use appraisal processes to reflect critically on the effectiveness of their teaching and learning practices</li>
<li>continue to develop research practices and high quality indicators of good practice that add depth to learning and bring about high levels of improvement in self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bright Horizons Drury completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bright Horizons Drury will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>17 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
