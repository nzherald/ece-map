</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pencarrow Kindergarten is located in Wainuiomata and provides education and care for children from two to five years of age. It offers morning sessions five days a week for 40 children and a shorter session for 20 children in the afternoons. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 42 children. The roll has become increasingly diverse and now includes families with a range of cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The teaching team is fully qualified. The programme is further assisted by support staff. The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO. An established teaching team provides a very stable staffing place.</p><p>The August 2012 ERO report identified an area requiring further development. This included the need for teachers to refine aspects of their assessment and review. They continue to monitor and further develop these processes. Professional learning and development has been accessed to improve aspects of practice. Teachers are committed to the ongoing acquisition of professional knowledge.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Hutt City Kindergarten Association (the association). Two professional practice managers (PPMs) are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers. Since the previous review there have been several changes to the General Manager.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten kindergarten reviews in the Hutt City Kindergarten.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The head teacher has a clear vision of how the kindergarten should operate to provide high quality early childhood education. She sets clear curriculum delivery expectations for the teaching team, children and parents. As a result the environment is calm, safe, aesthetically pleasing and exciting. Teachers and parents and whānau are supported to take an active role in all aspects of the kindergarten.</p><p>Children are engaged, busy and purposeful in their play. They work individually or in small groups, taking responsibility for much of their own learning. They make good use of the many resources available, making deliberate decisions and selections for their learning.</p><p>Literacy and numeracy are strong features of the programme. These are integrated and authentically interwoven into a wide range of experiences. Teachers encourage children to think, reason and experiment. They are respectful and support each other in their learning. Strong tuakina teina relationships are evident.</p><p>The kindergarten environment has been completely redeveloped over the past few years. This continues to evolve as teachers’ thinking deepens. The agreed philosophy underpins the curriculum and overall operation of the kindergarten. It has influenced the development of the outdoor play space which reflects, promotes and celebrates the culture of Māori and Pacific children. The natural environment, both indoors and outside, invite children to explore, create, construct and investigate.</p><p>Te reo me ngā tikānga Māori are well established in the kindergarten. Te reo Māori is heard frequently and used in conversations among children and between adults and children. Waiata and poi are popular experiences. Children remain engaged in these activities for sustained periods of time, enjoying learning together and building their expertise.</p><p>Strategies to support success for Māori and Pacific children have been developed with whānau, aiga and families. Teachers participate in external professional development to progress their knowledge, skill and awareness in these areas. Annual events such as the Umu and Waitangi Day celebrations that reflect the cultural backgrounds of Māori and Pacific children have become major community occasions.</p><p>Self review is developing and results have improved outcomes for children. A key next step is for teachers to strengthen self review and build capacity to evaluate their practice. This should provide additional information to judge the effectiveness of kindergarten operations, practice and to inform decision making.</p><p>The kindergarten has a well developed assessment, planning and evaluation process. Assessment information displayed in profile books is accessible to parents through an online programme. This identifies the learning taking place, shows how teachers add challenge and complexity and highlight children's progress for parents. These stories clearly link to children’s interests and whānau aspirations.</p><p>Links to assessment are evident in daily and weekly planning meetings. Children’s progress, interests, strengths and needs are discussed and then catered for through the wider curriculum.</p><p>The association is part way through the implementation of a new approach to appraisal. Once fully established this should assist leaders to provide a robust, supportive and developmental process. Kindergarten leaders should then undertake regular monitoring of how well appraisal is being implemented in each kindergarten.</p><p>The board receives a range of useful information. A key next step is for leaders to provide more evaluative reporting to assist in decision making and ongoing resourcing. The strategic plan provides a vision and shared direction to guide development. Establishing clearer measures of success should strengthen evaluation of progress towards goals. In addition, strategies that promote cultural responsiveness to Māori and Pacific families should be highlighted in strategic documents.</p><p>The professional practice managers provide half-yearly written reports. These provide information about how the kindergarten is meeting legislative requirements and at times, make recommendations. These reports should be strengthened to show how effective the programme is in improving outcomes for children and the quality of teaching and learning.</p><p>The association provides guidance and support for continuous improvement of teaching and learning. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>a useful framework and clear expectations that guide kindergarten operations and support the services to meet legislative and health and safety requirements</li>
<li>opportunities for professional learning and development for staff</li>
<li>sound support for provisionally registered teachers.</li>
</ul><p>At the time of the review the association was involved in a formal review to determine the future direction of Hutt City Kindergartens. ERO identified that, within the current operating model, the capacity of senior staff to provide targeted support that promotes ongoing improvement to teaching and learning is limited.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified priorities for improvement should include:</p><ul>
<li>teachers to clearly articulate the whānau shared vision of success into a clear framework for ongoing development and review</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen self-review practice.</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the measures used to evaluate the progress of the strategic plan</li>
<li>provide evaluative reports to support decision making</li>
<li>at a strategic level, identify strategies to promote cultural responsiveness to Māori and Pacific families</li>
<li>monitor each kindergarten to ensure the robust implementation of the appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pencarrow Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pencarrow Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>24 June 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
