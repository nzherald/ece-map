</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pukekawa Playcentre is a parent-led, sessional early childhood education service. It is part of the Counties Playcentre Association. The centre is situated in a rural Pukekawa, near Pukekohe and offers four supervised sessions per week. It is licensed for 25 children from birth to school age in a mixed-age setting, including 15 under the age of two years.</p><p>The centre's philosophy reflects aspirations of the Playcentre Federation, of whānau and children learning together through child-initiated play. The programme is guided by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, Early childhood curriculum and honours the Treaty of Waitangi.</p><p>The playcentre operates as a parent cooperative run by volunteers and is governed by a regional body and the New Zealand Playcentre Federation. During 2018, the Playcentre Federation is transitioning from operating as a federation with 32 regional associations to becoming one national body with six regional offices. The Auckland region is now made up of 45 playcentres from the Auckland, Tamaki and Counties Playcentre Associations. A regional manager oversees the governance, management and administration for this region and has a team of staff to support individual playcentres. The restructuring includes policies, technology and adult education. There continues to be a period of transition for all playcentre whānau and staff as they adapt to new systems and responsibilities.</p><p>The federation employ a part-time centre support worker (CSW) and centre administrator (CA) to manage day-to-day operations, curriculum and administration. Since the last ERO review there have been significant membership changes particularly over the last 18 months. The leadership role is held by a president who holds a course three qualification. To enable the playcentre to meet licensing requirements a qualified early childhood teacher attends one session per week and other members have sufficient playcentre qualifications or are working towards attaining course two and course three qualifications.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2015, development and progress with the strategic plan have identified a deeper focus on long term improvement. Improvements to the physical envrionments have been implemented to support challenge and learning, and a community focus around bicultural awareness through the curriculum has been developed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three playcentre reviews in the Counties Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience positive and meaningful learning interactions with parents and other adults. They are empowered to make choices about their learning and engage in long periods of sustained and uninterrupted play. The mixed-age learning spaces are inclusive and accessible to all children including diverse learners. Members are well supported through a holistic approach that is responsive to the needs of individual children and their family. Children benefit from learning partnerships that value and affirm the experiences they bring to their learning.</p><p>Children are well supported in an extensively equipped environment with quality resources that are focused on multiple interests and levels of ability. The learning environment enables children to make choices and decisions, and lead their own learning. Literacy and numeracy experiences are authentically and meaningfully woven into children's play. Transitions into and out of the centre are positive and centre members are continuing to build positive relationships with the local school. Children benefit from an attractively presented environment that is focused on enabling them to take risk and experience challenge through their learning.</p><p>Assessment is written by parents for their own and other children, highlighting the many play and learning opportunities children experience. End of session evaluations are collaborative, linked to children’s interests and engagement, to inform future planning. Termly planning has been strengthened and is linked to children’s emerging interests. Deliberate role modelling by experienced members supports knowledge sharing for new parents. Regular excursions into the wider community focus on extending learning and link to planning. Children are seen as confident learners and explorers.</p><p>Children under the age of two years enjoy a calm and responsive learning space. It is age appropriate and allows for free movement, fostering curiosity and independence. Members are reading and responding appropriately to very young children’s cues. Māori children and their whānau are welcomed and experience opportunities to have their language and culture affirmed. There is a considered approach to strengthening the bicultural curriculum dimension through the integration of karakia and te reo Māori into the daily programme.</p><p>Collaborative leadership enables opportunities for all members to extend and share their knowledge and skills. Leaders encourage members to engage in training that will build capability with a focus on increased centre sustainability. Professional learning and development is available both at centre and at federation level. Self review has been strengthened, it is now planned and responsive, and follows a useful framework that leads to change and improvement. Children benefit from experienced leaders who model quality practice, focused on positive learning outcomes.</p><p>The regional management team take responsibility for specific tasks relating to effective operations of individual playcentres. Newly appointed regional personnel are making progress with existing systems and establishing regional management structures for supporting centres. Centre support workers are guided by regional centre support coordinators. Systems are being developed for monitoring the quality of programmes for children, adult education levels, and health and safety requirements. The teams is aware of the unique strengths and needs of the playcentre and the regional manager provides professional leadership to sustain improvement, growth and the focus on fostering positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>With the centre having many new members there is now a need to offer mentoring and guidance to ensure:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>consistency of assessment practices are in place to support the understanding of noticing, recognising and responding to children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self review is consistently focused on positive outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve and strengthen practice the Auckland Playcentre regional leaders should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>revisit the commitment to Te Tiriti partnership to increase bicultural understanding and integration of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori to support playcentres' practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clarify and upskill playcentre support roles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build regional office capability to embed new parent education programmes and qualifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve understanding and use of internal evaluation as a tool to guide practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop, evaluate and report against a regional long-term and annual action plan aligned to goals for improvements at national and regional level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embed and evaluate how effectively the new playcentre structure and systems support all learners including Pasifika and children with additional needs.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pukekawa Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pukekawa Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Adrienne Fowler</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>9 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
