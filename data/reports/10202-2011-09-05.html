<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p>Bear Park Mt Eden Preschool provides very good quality education and care for children between two-and-a-half to five years of age. The centre shares the site with Bear Park Mt Eden Infant Toddlers, which caters for infants and toddlers. The two centres are part of the Bear Park group of early childhood centres. The franchise management team provides centre owners within the group with advice, audit and management support.</p>
<p>Programmes at Bear Park Centres reflect the Reggio Emilia philosophy. Staff see children as competent learners who construct their own working theories about the world. Teaching practices follow this philosophy within the framework of Te Wh&#257;riki, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum.</p>
<p>Children frequently engage in complex and imaginative play in the inviting, richly resourced environment, which encourages exploration and investigation. Children have well developed social skills and are able to manage their own behaviour. They are confident and capable learners who are respectful of each other&rsquo;s work and opinions.</p>
<p>Teachers support each other very well. They work skilfully alongside children, stimulating new thinking while building on prior learning. They clearly value children&rsquo;s ideas and contributions. Programme planning, assessment and evaluation processes reflect children&rsquo;s learning and are responsive to individual and group investigations.</p>
<p>Parents express a high level of satisfaction with the quality of education and care provided by the centre. Communication between the centre and families is open and responsive. The recent introduction of a parent portal as a means of sharing children&rsquo;s learning with their families has been received with enthusiasm. Centre managers will find it helpful to make further use of this effective communication tool.</p>
<p>The licensee manages the day to day operation of the centre. Effective and efficient management practices are in place. Self review is used as a tool for ongoing evaluation and improved practice. ERO, the licensee and centre managers agree that teachers should further consider ways of working with families and the wider community to enrich children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Bear Park Mt Eden Preschool was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Bear Park Mt Eden Preschool.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The 2008 ERO report noted the high quality care being provided for children in an environment that supported their emotional and physical wellbeing. The high quality of teaching interactions, learning resources and the stimulating, well presented environment contributed to the provision of meaningful learning experiences for children. ERO recommended that the quality of education be further enhanced by ensuring that children&rsquo;s individual interests were more prominent in the learning programme.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p><em>Positive outcomes for children.</em> Children&rsquo;s enthusiastic and purposeful engagement in play ensures that they settle quickly into the programme and take opportunities to explore the centre environment. They are confident and capable learners who participate in co-operative and collaborative play scenarios. Groups of children work together for sustained periods of time to develop complex, imaginative ideas. They are skilful in managing interactions with their peers, and show empathy, thoughtfulness, respect and care for others. Children are confident communicators who enjoy occasions when they can share their knowledge and ideas with teachers and other children.</p>
<p><em>Teaching and learning.</em> Teachers have formed warm and caring relationships with children. They have a good knowledge of children&rsquo;s interests and experiences away from the centre environment. Teachers are responsive to children and work to support and extend their learning. Most teachers use open-ended questions skilfully to challenge children&rsquo;s thinking, sustain conversations and to encourage children to talk about their own ideas. They use interactions with children to help them to develop increased knowledge and understanding and to prompt them to think about their prior learning.</p>
<p><em>Learning environment.</em> The spacious indoor and outdoor environments are attractively and thoughtfully presented and provide opportunities for children to engage in physical, imaginative and exploratory play. An extensive variety of activities support children&rsquo;s investigation and inquiry. Opportunities to develop learning about literacy, numeracy and science are integrated into the context of children&rsquo;s play. Children&rsquo;s sense of pride, ownership and respect for the centre&rsquo;s environment is evident as they engage in play activities.</p>
<p><em>Programme management.</em> Teachers notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s interests and encourage their involvement in a high quality educational programme. Regular entries in children&rsquo;s individual portfolios increasingly indicate how children&rsquo;s learning is extended over time. Planning documents show how teachers and children identify a focus for investigation and inquiry, share their knowledge, and then research and explore new ideas together. A collaborative team approach to assessment and evaluation facilitates reflective discussion that results in further enhancement of children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p><em>Partnerships with parents.</em> Families express a high level of satisfaction with the centre and comment on the reciprocal and trusting relationships that they and their children have with the teaching team. A wide variety of communication techniques, including an online parent portal, continues to provide opportunities for parents and teachers to work together. Regular informal sharing of information about children, and formal parent/teacher interviews, also contribute to positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p><em>Management and self review.</em> Annual and strategic management goals focus on ongoing improvement and whole centre development. Self review is systematic, well established and transparent. Review practices inform policy analysis and guide the ongoing enhancement of the learning programme for children. A responsive approach to external review has enabled centre managers to identify ways in which practices could be improved. Resultant improvements have had a positive impact on the programme provided for children.</p>
<p>Teacher appraisals promote reflective teaching practices and contribute to continued professional learning and development. Constructive feedback from managers enables teachers to refine their teaching practices and programme delivery. A comprehensive support and guidance programme is provided for provisionally registered teachers.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p><em>Ongoing improvement.</em> The licensee, management team and teachers work collaboratively to provide a high quality learning programme for children. The programme could be further enhanced by centre managers:</p>
<ul><li>continuing to build teachers&rsquo; skills in facilitating group learning opportunities</li>
<li>using parents&rsquo; feedback and contributions as part of processes for assessing and evaluating children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>ensuring teacher appraisal goals are more measurable</li>
<li>identifying positive outcomes for children in self review against strategic and management goals.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3>
<p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul><li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4>
<p>Although there are no M&#257;ori children currently enrolled in the centre, managers and teachers have considered ways in which they could welcome and respond to M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau in the future.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>Teachers have identified that developing relationships with all families is important. An individualised programme to support children&rsquo;s transition into the centre provides a sound base for the development of responsive and reciprocal relationships with wh&#257;nau.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p>In order to improve current practice and to reflect their commitment to New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage, centre managers and teachers could:</p>
<ul><li>place an increased focus on strengthening bicultural practices, including more frequent incidental use of te reo Maori in the programme</li>
<li>review centre philosophy, policies and teaching practices using tools such as Ka Hikitia, the Ministry of Education&rsquo;s M&#257;ori education strategy in relation to future provision for M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the management of Bear Park Mt Eden Preschool completed an ERO <em>Centre Management Assurance Statement</em> and <em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>

<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Bear Park Mt Eden Preschool.</p>
<p>Bear Park Mt Eden Preschool provides very good quality education and care for children between two-and-a-half to five years of age. The centre shares the site with Bear Park Mt Eden Infant Toddlers, which caters for infants and toddlers. The two centres are part of the Bear Park group of early childhood centres. The franchise management team provides centre owners within the group with advice, audit and management support.</p>
<p>Programmes at Bear Park Centres reflect the Reggio Emilia philosophy. Staff see children as competent learners who construct their own working theories about the world. Teaching practices follow this philosophy within the framework of Te Wh&#257;riki, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum.</p>
<p>Children frequently engage in complex and imaginative play in the inviting, richly resourced environment, which encourages exploration and investigation. Children have well developed social skills and are able to manage their own behaviour. They are confident and capable learners who are respectful of each other&rsquo;s work and opinions.</p>
<p>Teachers support each other very well. They work skilfully alongside children, stimulating new thinking while building on prior learning. They clearly value children&rsquo;s ideas and contributions. Programme planning, assessment and evaluation processes reflect children&rsquo;s learning and are responsive to individual and group investigations.</p>
<p>Parents express a high level of satisfaction with the quality of education and care provided by the centre. Communication between the centre and families is open and responsive. The recent introduction of a parent portal as a means of sharing children&rsquo;s learning with their families has been received with enthusiasm. Centre managers will find it helpful to make further use of this effective communication tool.</p>
<p>The licensee manages the day to day operation of the centre. Effective and efficient management practices are in place. Self review is used as a tool for ongoing evaluation and improved practice. ERO, the licensee and centre managers agree that teachers should further consider ways of working with families and the wider community to enrich children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h4>About ERO Reviews</h4>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<p>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</p>
<p>provide information to parents, communities and the Government. Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h4>Review Focus</h4>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h4>Review Coverage</h4>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h4>Review Recommendations</h4>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
