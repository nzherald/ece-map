<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Background</span></h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Small Oaks Early Learning Centre governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the November 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>management practice in relation to administrative and programme management systems</li>
<li>programme planning and implementation</li>
<li>self-review processes</li>
<li>appraisal of teachers</li>
<li>any other issues relevant to the management and operation of the centre that arise during the course of this review.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Small Oaks Early Learning Centre provides early childhood education and care for up to 25 children from infancy to school age in an adapted residential property in Manurewa, Auckland. This is the first ERO review of this centre under its new name. The centre was previously known as Original Kids Care and Education Centre and had been under new ownership for ten weeks prior to the November 2012 ERO review. It was relicensed under the 2008 Early Childhood Education Regulations in September 2013 and now includes provision for four children under two years of age.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report recommended centre managers continue to strengthen centre management and self-review processes. Centre managers have responded positively to ERO&rsquo;s findings. They, along with staff, have engaged in professional development to improve the quality of programme planning and implementation.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report also noted that children were settled, confident and played cooperatively. Teacher support for these good practices has been maintained.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>Teachers provide a good quality programme. This significant improvement has been helped by the enthusiasm and responsive approach of the centre owners and teachers. Teachers work well together and show a shared understanding of centre philosophy, expectations and effective practices. The use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori is a strength of the programme. Routines are flexible, responsive to children&rsquo;s preferences and encourage the development of children&rsquo;s social and self-managing skills</p><p>Children are confident and use their imagination in play. They have a strong sense of belonging in the centre and enjoy the company of their teachers and peers. Infants and toddlers spend most of their day with their older peers and have a restful space for quiet times. Teachers interact with children in supportive and caring ways, and respond positively to children&rsquo;s ideas and preferences. They could increase their use of strategies that further develop conversations with children to promote children's independent thinking, language development and problem-solving skills. This good practice would help extend child-initiated play and is likely to promote more complex and interesting learning experiences.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s opportunities to learn and engage in sustained play are well supported through the range of resources, equipment and activities available in the centre environment. Children have good opportunities for physical challenge in the recently redeveloped outside area. The environment is well organised, family orientated and welcoming. It reflects a commitment to biculturalism and appreciation of children&rsquo;s creative expression. Children have freedom to explore, have fun and learn in a purposeful and relaxed atmosphere.</p><p>Teachers are now documenting planning and assessment processes well. They record how they notice and respond to children&rsquo;s group interests. Planning is becoming increasingly focused on extending child-initiated learning. Children&rsquo;s individual learning portfolios provide a good record of their involvement in the programme.</p><p>Good management and effective administration systems have been established and contribute to the smooth running of the centre. Effective processes include:</p><ul>
<li>self review focused on improving outcomes for children</li>
<li>comprehensive centre record keeping</li>
<li>a sound policy and procedure framework to guide teacher practice</li>
<li>long-term and annual plans with strategies for ongoing development</li>
<li>vigilant monitoring of health and safety practices</li>
<li>implementation of a sound performance management process that promotes teacher reflection about good professional practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>Centre managers agree that engaging in external professional development would assist them in developing robust self-review practices.</p><p>Continued external centre-wide professional development should further improve assessment, planning and evaluation practices. Good practices could include:</p><ul>
<li>more parent and child involvement in assessment and planning</li>
<li>children&rsquo;s portfolios more consistently reflecting the child&rsquo;s cultural heritage and recording how the child&rsquo;s individual interests were noticed, responded to and built on over time</li>
<li>evaluation of the effectiveness of teaching strategies in extending children&rsquo; interests and ideas.</li>
</ul><a id="3-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>27 March 2014</p><a id="information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Service</h2><table>
