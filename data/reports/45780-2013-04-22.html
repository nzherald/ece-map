<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Kauri Kids Otara is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Kauri Kids Otara has been in operation for a year and is fully licensed under the 2008 Early Childhood Regulations to provide an all day service. It is one of five centres that operate under the Auckland Council Manukau Leisure Services and caters for children from two to five years of age.</p><p>Leadership of the centre is provided by a manager appointed by the Council. A curriculum leader, who works in all five centres, has supported staff with advice and professional learning opportunities. The supervisor provides support and guidance as well as cultural expertise for the centre and for its Pacific community. The centre&rsquo;s annual planning is informed by its strategic priorities as well as the Auckland Plan. The centre benefits from the services and facilities provided by the Auckland Council Manukau Leisure Services. Children and families make good use of the community facilities in the Manukau Leisure Centre complex.</p><p>This is Kauri Kids Otara&rsquo;s first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The management and teachers have established good systems, policies and procedures to provide an education and care service for children. Effective systems are in place to create a secure environment that welcomes families and children into the centre. Children&rsquo;s interests are promoted through positive relationships and learning through play. The diverse team of teachers at the centre work collaboratively to provide for their multicultural community, most of whom speak English as an additional language.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy is evident in the programme and environment and caters appropriately for the community. Teachers and children show respect for others as well as for the learning environment. The focus on fun and developing strong social skills is a priority for children&rsquo;s learning that is identified by parents and promoted by teachers. Families benefit from the support and guidance provided by the centre.</p><p>Leaders have established a culture of ongoing improvement. Policies are up to date, reviewed regularly and guide good practice. Self review systems are evident and inform planning. Resources and funding are well managed. Teachers evaluate the programme regularly. Leaders want to continue their work to develop the centre philosophy so that they promote a good quality service that is directed and targeted to M&#257;ori and Pacific children.</p><p>Developing strong leadership and succession planning is a priority for the Council. The centre supervisor has built credibility with the Pacific community and models culturally appropriate practices for teachers, parents and children. Ongoing learning is provided through workshops across the network of five centres where teachers are supported to build their professional practice. Teachers&rsquo; professional development needs are identified with their appraisers and monitored regularly. Ongoing sharing of their practice with other centres will continue to build teachers&rsquo; capability and expertise. Managers could also support teachers to develop a stronger culture of reflection on their own practice and its impact on children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Respectful, culturally appropriate relationships are evident among teachers, and between teachers and children and wh&#257;nau, families and aiga. These relationships have built a trusting and caring atmosphere in the centre. Teachers work well together. They understand the community and respond appropriately to children&rsquo;s learning needs.</p><p>Children confidently approach their teachers who take time to listen and support them, especially those with English as an additional language. Teachers could now consider ways to extend children&rsquo;s thinking through fostering more complex play and building children&rsquo;s confidence to talk and extend their conversation skills.</p><p>Curriculum expertise is provided through the curriculum leader who has set up systems and processes for the centre. <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, is evident in the planning and the programme. Parents are invited to view and contribute to the planning. Portfolios show children&rsquo;s learning through stories and photographs that highlight their interests. They are available for parents, who are encouraged to comment on their child&rsquo;s progress.</p><p>The learning environment is well maintained, cheerful and welcoming. A variety of equipment and resources are provided so that children learn through play, and children are engaged for extended periods of time on some activities. The next stage would be for teachers to further develop the environment to encourage children&rsquo;s thinking and creativity, and to better reflect the diverse cultures of its community.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kauri Kids Otara completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>22 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><h3>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h3><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
