</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kawerau Preschool Learning Centre operates from 7.30am to 5.15pm Monday to Friday. The current roll of 58 children includes 40 who are of Māori descent. The centre operates two areas, one for infants and toddlers and the other for young children.</p><p>The centre’s is governed by an incorporated society whose membership consists of voluntary parent and community members. At the recent 2015 annual general meeting a larger group of parent and community members were elected.</p><p>This centre’s philosophy is currently been reviewed. Whanaungatanga is the foundation for collaboration between children, whānau and community. Curiosity, creativity and imagination are encouraged through child-initiated play experiences and the exploration of the natural world.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review there have been considerable upgrades to centre environments. There has been significant development in the areas identified in the 2012 ERO report. These relate to strengthening bicultural assessment, increasing the priority on literacy, numeracy and computer technologies and continuing to document children's learning and development over time.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>An experienced and knowledgeable chairperson leads the management committee and works closely with the centre manager to set direction and purpose for the centre. A strategic plan clearly identifies the centre priorities and goals, which are strongly linked to positive outcomes for children and their families. A strong emphasis is placed on encouraging parents and whānau to take an active role in their children’s learning and education.</p><p>The centre manager provides strong professional leadership. Together with staff she has developed a collaborative approach to providing positive learning opportunities for infants, toddlers, young children and their whānau and families. Leaders have established a culture in which children are first and foremost valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning. Leaders keep up to date with current theories and practices in early childhood education through ongoing professional development. All teachers are valued and active participants in centre appraisal processes. Their knowledge and skills are recognised and opportunities are provided to build emergent leadership.</p><p>Strong responsive, respectful relationships are formed with children and their families. Teachers know children and their whānau well and acknowledge parent and whānau aspirations. Children experience a wide range of learning opportunities through community involvement, excursions, and visitors to the centre. Te ao Māori is naturally integrated into all areas of learning through the implementation of kaitiakitanga (sustainability), auahatanga (creativity,) whakawhānaungatanga (relationships), and tino rangatiratanga (independence). Children learn through play and are encouraged to follow their interests. Self review is well used to evaluate centre practices and is leading to continual improvement in learning opportunities for children. Parents and whānau are informed through a range of communication practices about children's learning and daily activities at the centre.</p><p>A feature of the centre is the calm, peaceful and trusting environment provided for infants and toddlers who are settled and confident. Teachers model care, respect and aroha through their interactions and flexibility in health care routines.</p><p>Teachers use effective strategies to engage children in learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>open-ended questions to encourage thinking and problem solving</li>
<li>recognising opportunities to build literacy and numeracy concepts in children’s play</li>
<li>fostering tuakana-teina relationships to support childrens learning</li>
<li>supporting children to make decisions about their learning.</li>
</ul><p>Through the use of these strategies teachers strongly promote the success and well being of infants toddlers and young children.</p><p>Children’s sense of belonging is nurtured through effective transitions into, and within the centre. Parents are encouraged to actively participate in transitioning their child to school.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management, leaders and teachers continue to develop the learning partnership with whānau and parents to:</p><ul>
<li>make the voice of children, parents and whānau more visible in information about children’s learning</li>
<li>further extend children’s learning to build on their capabilities and competencies.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kawerau Preschool Learning Centre (Incorporated) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kawerau Preschool Learning Centre (Incorporated) will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>22 February 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
