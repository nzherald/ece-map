<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Nawton Family Playcentre governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the June 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>the development of a shared centre philosophy aligned to playcentre philosophy</li>
<li>valuing cultural diversity and reflecting this in the programme</li>
<li>maximising the potential of equipment and materials for learning</li>
<li>recording children&rsquo;s learning to enable them to revisit, share and celebrate their achievements</li>
<li>aspects of compliance related to trips and excursions, fire and earthquake drills, and securing heavy equipment that might fall or topple.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Nawton Family Playcentre is located in the suburb of Nawton, Hamilton. It operates under the umbrella of Waikato Playcentre Association (WPA). It is licensed for 30 children at any one time, including up to 17 children under two years of age. At the time of the review, 9 children were enrolled, including 4 children under two years old. The centre was relicensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em> in April 2013.</p><p>Centre members, with effective support from WPA personnel, have made good progress in establishing a shared centre philosophy. Centre membership has increased and the centre continues to host Supporting Parents Alongside Children&rsquo;s Education (SPACE) sessions on five afternoons each week. The WPA has employed a teacher with a playcentre qualification and a recognised qualification in early childhood education to supervise playcentre sessions and assist with centre management. Significant improvements have been made to the safety of the outdoor play area.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>The centre philosophy is prominently displayed and highly evident in centre culture. Parents and children are enjoying positive and reciprocal relationships in a welcoming and inclusive social environment. This reflects the agreed philosophy statement, &lsquo;adults and children playing and learning while having fun at playcentre&rsquo;.</p><p>Centre members have attended regular planning meetings to focus on children&rsquo;s individual interests. They are gaining confidence to document and display children&rsquo;s interests and to guide parent interactions with children. Parents meet as a group at the end of each session. This time is used to evaluate and review the programme and to plan activities and experiences for following sessions. Individual learning stories are displayed for parents and later included in children&rsquo;s individual profile books. These books are available to children and contain a record of their participation in aspects of the programme. Parents are building their understanding of assessment and documenting children&rsquo;s learning by attending in-centre training courses provided by the WPA.</p><p>M&#257;ori cultural perspectives are now more visible in the environment and programme. This development has been enhanced by the WPA&rsquo;s appointment of a knowledgeable kaiawhina who guides and builds parent understanding of tikanga M&#257;ori and te reo M&#257;ori. Centre members have celebrated Matariki at the centre and enjoyed sharing food and appropriate activities with children. The diverse cultures of families are also more visible in centre displays and celebrations. These improvements are contributing to a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing amongst families, wh&#257;nau and children.</p><p>The presentation of equipment and materials for play is attractive and enables children to explore and experience a wide variety during the session. Recently, there has been a focus on familiarising new members with the 16 areas of play. Members have taken responsibility for overseeing a particular area of play during the session. More experienced members and the centre supervisor model and guide newer members in the use of equipment and resources to promote and extend children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Centre self review has recently focused on the centre philosophy, strengthening biculturalism and centre planning. The self-review process is supported by useful frameworks to guide centre members. Regular meetings are held to make decisions about centre operations and programme plans. Self review is contributing to centre development and improvement.</p><p>The experienced centre support worker and other knowledgeable and enthusiastic WPA members continue to provide ongoing and valued support and mentoring for the centre. The well-qualified supervisor is providing effective leadership for the centre and contributes significantly to the quality of the programme for children and their families. This ongoing professional support enhances centre sustainability and ongoing development in the context of a parent-led playcentre cooperative.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that areas for further review and development are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>integrate the philosophy with the playcentre curriculum and the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whariki</em> the early childhood curriculum</li>
<li>develop assessment practices and display current learning stories where children can easily view them to revisit and share their learning</li>
<li>strengthen the connection between identifying children&rsquo;s interests, strengths and their next steps in profile books and programme practice</li>
<li>support parents and wh&#257;nau to develop their understanding of the environment as the third teacher, and develop parents own role as teachers when interacting with children.</li>
</ul><p>These reviews and developments need to be supported by making effective use of the Ministry of Education&rsquo;s guidelines and resources for self review, programme development and meeting regulatory requirements.</p><a id="3-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>2 September 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Service</h2><table>
