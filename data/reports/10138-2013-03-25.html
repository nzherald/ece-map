<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Natural Steps Early Childhood Centre (Ellerslie Village) is well placed to promote positive outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Natural Steps Early Childhood Centre (Ellerslie Village) was, prior to 2011, known as Incey Wincey Learners Private Pre-School. In November 2012, the centre was licensed under the 2008 Regulations. Under its previous owner the centre has had a history of positive ERO reviews.</p><p>There are two separate buildings on this large site. Renovations are underway to create spaces that will maximise children&rsquo;s learning and have a better flow when children are moving between play spaces. Currently one villa is used for children up to the age of two years and the other is for children from two years to school age. The owner is committed to maintaining the good adult-to-child ratio she has established.</p><p>There are 13 staff members. Most are long serving, qualified and registered teachers. Teachers are supported through professional development to meet the centre&rsquo;s aspirations for high quality programmes. The leadership team consists of the owner, the centre director who manages the centre&rsquo;s daily operations, and two head teachers who lead the curriculum and teams in their different age groups.</p><p>The new owner is an experienced educator. She has established a teaching team with shared philosophies and understandings about quality provision for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The model of primary care giving for children up to the age of two years helps children to settle into the centre. Positive relationships between the wh&#257;nau and teachers are enhanced and teachers develop a close bond with the children in their care. Walks in the local community strengthen connections with the community.</p><p>Under the guidance of a very capable centre director the teachers have used self review to improve their teaching practice. They could now strengthen their self-review processes by using formal documentation to monitor their progress. Team leaders and teachers acknowledge how much they have accomplished since the change of ownership.</p><p>A culture of respect, care and affection is evident between adults and children. Deliberate and effective modelling of appropriate teaching practices by more experienced teachers helps teachers in training and those new to their roles. There is a sense of all adults valuing and being open to learning.</p><p>The dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand is evident in the programme. Teachers consistently use te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in their incidental interactions with children. Teachers identified that they should continue to strengthen their bicultural practices and to provide opportunities for all children to be recognised as unique individuals with their own identity, culture, and language.</p><p>The curriculum for children over the age of two years is determined by the centre&rsquo;s educational philosophy and practices. Teachers value children&rsquo;s learning. They see children as competent and capable of building their own theories, making sense of their world. The play areas are well resourced and inviting. The new owner has challenged teachers to make informed choices about how well they highlight children&rsquo;s learning experiences.</p><p>Leadership in the centre is collaborative. Teachers understand parents&rsquo; aspirations well and are responsive to them. Self review is valued and is effectively led. The centre director and owner ensure that teachers have time to critically reflect on their practice. They encourage teachers to develop their leadership capacity through delegated responsibilities with events and focused projects in the programme.</p><p>The centre is well managed. Clear documentation and systems are in place enabling the centre to build its capacity and sustain its good practices in the future. The centre&rsquo;s strategic plan gives direction for managers and the staff. To support their strategic plan the centre director could improve annual plans and monitor the extent of progress towards strategic goals.</p><p>The leadership team agree that teachers could further strengthen the curriculum and promote positive outcomes for children by:</p><ul>
<li>developing programme planning that supports individual children's interests</li>
<li>improving the quality and frequency of the documented assessment for individual children.</li>
</ul><p>ERO and the leadership team agree that relevant next steps to strengthen governance and management include:</p><ul>
<li>developing performance management systems so that appraisals and professional development are more clearly aligned and linked to the centre&rsquo;s strategic and annual goals</li>
<li>reviewing the centre&rsquo;s philosophy so that it reflects their commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Natural Steps Early Childhood Centre (Ellerslie Village) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>25 March 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
