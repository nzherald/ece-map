</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waianiwa Kindergarten has recently changed from being community-based to a privately-owned kindergarten in Western Southland. It is a small, rural centre with a maximum roll of 19. Children come from a wide geographical area to attend the centre. The centre has extended its hours of service and is now open five days a week from 8.00am until 2.30pm.</p><p>All staff, apart from the owner, are new to the kindergarten, since the 2015 ERO review.</p><p>Key points from the philosophy include a focus on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strong, reciprocal relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children learning in a positive, safe environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allowing children time to be competent, confident, life-long learners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting tuakana-teina relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teaching children to respect and take responsibility for people, places and things</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing a fun, child-initiated, play-based programme that challenges and empowers children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers have made good progress on most of the recommendations since the last ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive, respectful relationships are highly evident at all levels. Interactions between teachers and children are learning focused. Teachers build children's oral language, support children's literacy and numeracy development and build children's knowledge of the world and understanding of themselves as learners. Teachers actively support children to be independent and confident.</p><p>Children play and learn through a variety of interesting activities. The centre provides a wide range of resources which children have ready access to. This enables them to make choices about what they want to do and use. Regular visits and shared activities with the local school help children to make smooth transitions. Teachers provide activities and experiences that are relevant to the rural environment and children's home lives.</p><p>The curriculum includes Māori perspectives. The support from The Resource Teacher of Māori has strengthened the competence of teachers in te reo and tikanga Māori. Children's awareness of their bicultural heritage is increasing.</p><p>Planning and assessment links closely to Te Whāriki (The Early Childhood Curriculum). Planning supports children's identified needs and learning. Teachers and parents set goals for children's learning and development. Learning stories clearly show children's progress towards identified goals and how teachers plan to extend the intended learning. Children with diverse needs are well catered for. They have individual development plans and receive support from outside agencies.</p><p>The owners have strengthened the professional capability of the staff by addressing both individual teacher and centre needs. The centre is at the beginning stages of implementing internal evaluation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre have identified the following areas for further development to improve outcomes for children. These are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>gather parent voice for the development of the philosophy and valued outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reflect the centre's commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi in the philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reinstate group planning based on the identified needs of the children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The owners and centre manager need to develop and implement a system for the timely review of policies and procedures.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waianiwa Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>A number of health and safety issues were identified while ERO was on site. To address these issues the owner and manager need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure exit doors are clear of obstacles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop risk-analysis management documents for all excursions beyond the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>add the Vulnerable Children's Act requirements to the appointments procedure.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waianiwa Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>30 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
