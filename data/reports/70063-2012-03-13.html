<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p>ABC Tumara Park Rua caters for children from birth to school age. The nursery and the preschool are separate and each has its own outdoor space. The teachers are qualified early childhood teachers or training to become early childhood teachers.</p>
<p>The centre provides good quality care and education for children. Staff members are warm, welcoming and responsive. They respect children and place considerable importance on children&rsquo;s well-being. This helps to ensure that there are positive relationships between children and their teachers, and with each other. ERO observed children who were happy, settled and confident in the centre environment.</p>
<p>Parents&rsquo; contributions are valued. They make considerable contributions to their child&rsquo;s learning at the centre and maintain links between home and centre learning.</p>
<p>Other features of the programme include the:</p>
<ul><li>organised and resourced learning environment</li>
<li>inclusion of literacy, numeracy and te reo M&#257;ori</li>
<li>good use of assessment information to plan programmes for individual children.</li>
</ul><p>Leadership is effective. The area manager and centre director share a vision for the centre and children&rsquo;s learning that has been developed in consultation with staff and families. Plans for the future development of the centre incorporate this vision. Progress is carefully monitored by managers, staff and families.</p>
<p>The centre has gone through a number of staff changes. New children have joined the centre during 2011 and 2012. Many of these changes have been as a result of the Christchurch earthquakes.</p>
<p>The next steps for the centre include ensuring that the centre&rsquo;s vision for high-quality learning and teaching is shared, understood and worked towards by all staff and families.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of ABC Tumara Park Rua was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atABC Tumara Park Rua.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The centre philosophy states that the centre will provide a warm, friendly and inviting atmosphere for children and families. Children will be nurtured and respected. Teachers will know the children well and make effective use of their interests to extend their learning. Family cultures, values and beliefs will be incorporated into the programme.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>Relationships are positive and respectful between teachers and children, and among children and each other. Teachers work effectively as a team to support each other in the programme and children&rsquo;s well-being. Parents are encouraged to be an integral part of the centre and their children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p>The learning environment is well organised and responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and needs. Teachers provide a good range of activities and resources that children freely select from. Literacy and numeracy are well integrated into the programme. Many teachers use te reo M&#257;ori naturally in their conversations with children. Children make good use of imaginative play to develop their understanding of the real world.</p>
<p>Routines are well considered and shared with the children in the nursery and the preschool. Nursery staff make good use of routines to help children develop a sense of belonging and predictability to their day. Children know the limits and boundaries of acceptable behaviour in the preschool. Transitioning into the centre and between the nursery and the preschool is well managed and respectful of children and families. As a result, children and families identify strongly with the centre as a place where they belong and feel at home.</p>
<p>Most teachers make good use of assessment to plan programmes for individual children that build on their interests and provide direction for future learning. Parents are active partners in their child&rsquo;s learning, helping children and teachers to link home and centre learning and experiences.</p>
<p>Leadership is effective and shared. Individual staff strengths are recognised and used at all levels. Managers and staff make good use of strategic planning and self review to continue to improve the quality of learning and care for children.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p>The centre has experienced a number of staff changes and introduced many new children to the centre during 2011 and 2012.</p>
<p>The managers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps for improving learning and teaching include:</p>
<ul><li>reviewing the philosophy to ensure that there is a shared understanding among managers, staff and families</li>
<li>ensuring that there is consistency and a shared understanding of assessment and planning practices</li>
<li>continuing to develop teaching strategies to extend children&rsquo;s thinking and problem-solving skills.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of ABC Tumara Park Rua completed an ERO <em>Centre Assurance Statement</em> and <em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>

<ul><li>organised and resourced learning environment</li>
<li>inclusion of literacy, numeracy and te reo M&#257;ori</li>
<li>good use of assessment information to plan programmes for individual children.</li>
</ul><p>Leadership is effective. The area manager and centre director share a vision for the centre and children&rsquo;s learning that has been developed in consultation with staff and families. Plans for the future development of the centre incorporate this vision. Progress is carefully monitored by managers, staff and families.</p>
<p>The centre has gone through a number of staff changes. New children have joined the centre during 2011 and 2012. Many of these changes have been as a result of the Christchurch earthquakes.</p>
<p>The next steps for the centre include ensuring that the centre&rsquo;s vision for high-quality learning and teaching is shared, understood and worked towards by all staff and families.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h4>About ERO Reviews</h4>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h4>Review Focus</h4>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h4>Review Coverage</h4>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h4>Review Recommendations</h4>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
