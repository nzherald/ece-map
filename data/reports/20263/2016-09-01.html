</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Gillies Ave is part of the BestStart Education and Care Centres organisation. BestStart provides this service with an overarching governance and management structure and support, and key personnel who oversee centre operations. A new centre manager and a head teacher work closely with a designated Professional Services Manager and a Business Manager from BestStart.</p><p>This purpose-built service is licensed for up to 65 children, with a maximum of 20 aged under two years. The roll reflects a range of cultures and ethnicities. Children are provided for in two distinct areas, designated for infants and toddlers under two, or for pre-school children aged over two years. Each has an age-appropriate outside space. The centre is seeking to appoint a second head teacher, so that each learning area will be overseen by a member of the leadership team. The majority of staff are permanent qualified teachers or BestStart relievers.</p><p>ERO's 2013 report identified positive outcomes for children and families, with respect for diverse languages and cultures evident. ERO noted that the service needed to lift the overall quality of teaching practice and improve the learning environment for infants and toddlers. Since then, the environment has been completely refurbished, and the majority of staff have been newly appointed. From 2015, a new centre manager has worked purposefully and collaboratively to promote enhanced outcomes for all children. A range of systems, expectations and procedures have been developed, supporting strategic improvement at all levels.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children in this centre are confident and enthusiastic learners and explorers. Their wellbeing is prioritised with respectful and nurturing relationships that are focused on supporting a strong sense of belonging. Children are invited appropriately to participate in routines and to make decisions about their play. The two learning areas provide stimulating and age-appropriate materials and activities that have been well organised to support developing interests and learning dispositions. Outdoor areas promote physical activity and exploration. Considered placement of wall displays and collections of materials and artefacts prompt children to peruse, explore and engage in activities. Children are settled and engage in creative, social and imaginative play.</p><p>The centre programme and philosophy are well articulated, and are underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. These highlight a set of key values, and are purposeful and forward thinking in supporting children's readiness for school and promoting a respect for nature and the environment. Mathematics and literacy learning are incorporated through play. With sound leadership, there has been a significant positive shift in teaching practices aligned to these key documents, reflecting the centre's priorities and goals for children's education and care.</p><p>Teachers seek to uphold home routines and foster strong attachments with children and families. Good information is provided for parents about the centre operations and approach. A new digital parent-portal provides an additional way for reciprocal home-centre sharing of learning.</p><p>Teaching teams have worked in a focused way to improve planning, by developing a new approach. Wall displays identify key group themes, and recognise threads of learning linked to the curriculum. The language, culture and identity of children and their families are respectfully represented in activities and the environment, and in conversation. Managers are supporting teachers to further move toward child-led play. Teachers now need to articulate how they actively and regularly support children's learning and development in deliberate ways, making these threads of learning more evident in individual planning and assessment records.</p><p>The new centre manager has expectations for high quality practice. BestStart systems, procedures, policies and personnel provide good support for the centre. Managers effectively oversee service operations, using BestStart audit and appraisal systems. They value self review as a tool for improvement, and collaborate with teachers to evaluate aspects of programmes, practice and environment. Regular meetings are a forum for discussing self-review findings and children's learning, supporting enhanced professional practice. Managers are initiating teachers' deeper reflections about practice, and continue to scaffold a shared understanding of evaluation approaches, and use.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>BestStart managers and the head teacher agree that key next steps for the service include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to improve planning and assessment practices, so that teachers more clearly identify ways they can support and extend learning opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a strategic plan for further promotion of Māori language, culture and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhancing transition practices by now strengthening links with local schools</p>
</li>
</ul><p>teachers documenting their reflections and examples of inquiry, in line with BestStart expectations, and to show how they are meeting the <em>Practising Teacher Criteria.</em></p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that BestStart managers continue to support the centre leadership team to implement and embed its plans for quality improvement.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Gillies Ave completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, centre managers could review sleeping routines for children over two years, to ensure they receive undisturbed rest.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Gillies Ave will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>1 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
