<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p align="left">Paremata Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p align="left">Children at Paremata Kindergarten are highly engaged in self chosen learning activities. There are regular opportunities for the children to direct their own play. They are encouraged and supported by teachers to regularly think and talk about activities and children&rsquo;s use of them.</p>
<p align="left">Planning is highly responsive to children&rsquo;s interests. Daily lunchtime review and planning sessions allow children to have input into programmes and assessment. Through the &lsquo;show and tell&rsquo; sessions children share models to encourage and inspire other children&rsquo;s learning. Children develop confidence and leadership skills in group situations.</p>
<p align="left">Portfolios clearly identify each child&rsquo;s learning and progress over time. Many learning stories communicate teachers&rsquo; depth of knowledge about the child&rsquo;s strengths and developmental interests. Including more regular parent and children&rsquo;s voice should strengthen these records of learning.</p>
<p align="left">Evaluation and self review practices are inclusive, widespread and well documented. Self review is becoming embedded across kindergarten programmes and procedures. Teachers demonstrate a collaborative, reflective approach to continually improve their practice and outcomes for children.</p>
<p align="left">Children freely access the wide range of learning resources to sustain and enrich their interests and learning. The environment enables children to engage in self- directed play. They have access to a wide range of natural materials to support their creative and construction activities. Wall displays reflect the kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy, current programme planning and outcomes to inform and involve parents. The welcoming and inclusive environment promotes a sense of belonging for children and parents alike. Transitions in and out of the kindergarten are planned and well managed. Parents and siblings are encouraged to be involved. The kindergarten has close relationships with local schools. Parents support and celebrate children&rsquo;s progress and achievement.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p align="left">Before the review, the management of Paremata Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atParemata Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p>
<ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p align="left">Paremata Kindergarten is a well established centre situated in a sheltered seaside location at Ivey Bay. Since the May 2008 ERO review, the kindergarten has moved to an all day licence and the teaching team increased to a head teacher and three teachers. Older children attend for three days and younger children on the other two.</p>
<p align="left">The addition of native plantings, landscaping, redevelopment of some exterior areas and interior refurbishment has enhanced the aesthetics, safety and opportunities for play and learning.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p align="left"><b>Programme</b></p>
<p align="left">Children are highly engaged in self-chosen learning activities. There are regular opportunities for children to direct their own play. They are encouraged and supported by teachers to regularly think and talk about their learning. Teachers also support children to follow, enrich and extend their interests through deliberate teaching strategies.</p>
<p align="left">Planning is highly responsive to children&rsquo;s interests. Teachers use daily lunchtime review and planning sessions to gather children&rsquo;s input into programmes and assessment. Teachers&rsquo; daily meetings include reflection and monitoring of learning stories. Useful systems for planning and assessment allow educators to capture and respond to learning.</p>
<p align="left">Children are increasingly willing to share their learning with others. They act as tutors and provide models to encourage and enhance other children&rsquo;s play. Learners have regular opportunities to extend their literacy, numeracy, science and technology skills and interests. They are challenged to think, problem solve and test their ideas in a range of contexts. Children successfully integrate information and communications technology (ICT) to broaden their learning options.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers actively promote the use of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori through the programme, their interactions and the environment. Children actively participate and respond in weekly sessions led by an external tutor. Opportunities are highly valued and supported by parents and teachers to further their own learning and confidence. Educators are currently reviewing the links between the principles and values of tikanga M&#257;ori and the kindergarten philosophy.</p>
<p align="left">Portfolios clearly record each child&rsquo;s learning and engagement with the programme and progress over time. Many learning stories communicate a teacher&rsquo;s depth of knowledge about a child&rsquo;s strengths and developing interests. They celebrate relationships and emerging social skills. They often link to earlier stories and parent aspirations.</p>
<p align="left">The next step is to provide more space and opportunities to collect and document child and parent voices. ERO affirms teachers&rsquo; initiatives for reviewing this area to further strengthen partnerships.</p>
<p align="left">Evaluation and self review practices are responsive, widespread and well documented. They are becoming increasingly embedded across programmes and procedures. Teachers demonstrate a highly reflective enquiry approach to their practice. They work collaboratively to develop a shared understanding of quality early childhood education programmes and practices.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers have established a useful framework for curriculum reviews which:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left">helps examine teachers&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s roles in learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">evaluates the impact of a programme on children&rsquo;s knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">examines the learning partnerships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">identifies priorities and emphases in the curriculum and programmes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Transitions in and out of the kindergarten are planned and well managed. Parents and siblings are encouraged to be involved in sessions and learning opportunities. The kindergarten has close relationships with local schools. Exit interviews with parents share and celebrate progress and achievement.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Interactions</b></p>
<p align="left">Respectful, inclusive and calm interactions among teachers, children and parents are widely evident. Teachers engage in authentic and meaningful conversations about the child&rsquo;s interests and the world.</p>
<p align="left">Educators show a high level of interest in children and their family context and well-being. Parents value the commitment to and care of their children. Teachers support children to play cooperatively and affirm each other. Social skills are modelled and reinforced in group situations.</p>
<p align="left">A belief in whanaungatanga is evident at mealtimes and in practices and routines during the day. Children have many opportunities to learn about and through bicultural perspectives.</p>
<p align="left">The team is effectively led by the head teacher and demonstrates a strong sense of professionalism, purpose and collegiality.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Environment</b></p>
<p align="left">Well resourced and thoughtfully placed learning spaces enable children to move freely between areas to engage in real and deliberate learning opportunities. Good indoor and outdoor flow allows play to be extended.</p>
<p align="left">Children freely access the wide range of learning resources to support and enrich their interests and learning. The environment enables children to engage in self- directed play. Children have access to a wide range of natural materials for creative and construction activities.</p>
<p align="left">The indoor environment has generous space to display planning, celebrate achievements and offers opportunities for children to revisit learning. The welcoming environment promotes a sense of belonging for children and parents alike.</p>
<h3>Association Support</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p align="left">The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p>
<p align="left">Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p>
<p align="left">The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy <em>Te Manawa</em>: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p align="left">The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left">the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">a wide range of professional development opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p align="left">The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left">further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</p>

<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-paremata-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Paremata Kindergarten</h2>
<p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Paremata Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">Paremata Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p align="left">Children at Paremata Kindergarten are highly engaged in self chosen learning activities. There are regular opportunities for the children to direct their own play. They are encouraged and supported by teachers to regularly think and talk about activities and children&rsquo;s use of them.</p>
<p align="left">Planning is highly responsive to children&rsquo;s interests. Daily lunchtime review and planning sessions allow children to have input into programmes and assessment. Through the &lsquo;show and tell&rsquo; sessions children share models to encourage and inspire other children&rsquo;s learning. Children develop confidence and leadership skills in group situations.</p>
<p align="left">Portfolios clearly identify each child&rsquo;s learning and progress over time. Many learning stories communicate teachers&rsquo; depth of knowledge about the child&rsquo;s strengths and developmental interests. Including more regular parent and children&rsquo;s voice should strengthen these records of learning.</p>
<p align="left">Evaluation and self review practices are inclusive, widespread and well documented. Self review is becoming embedded across kindergarten programmes and procedures. Teachers demonstrate a collaborative, reflective approach to continually improve their practice and outcomes for children.</p>
<p align="left">Children freely access the wide range of learning resources to sustain and enrich their interests and learning. The environment enables children to engage in self- directed play. They have access to a wide range of natural materials to support their creative and construction activities. Wall displays reflect the kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy, current programme planning and outcomes to inform and involve parents. The welcoming and inclusive environment promotes a sense of belonging for children and parents alike. Transitions in and out of the kindergarten are planned and well managed. Parents and siblings are encouraged to be involved. The kindergarten has close relationships with local schools. Parents support and celebrate children&rsquo;s progress and achievement.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.&nbsp;</p>

<a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2>
<h3>About ERO</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
