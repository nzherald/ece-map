</table><p>Kindercare Learning Centres 209 is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres 209 is located in Woolston. It is one of 11 early childhood education and care centres in Christchurch owned and administered by Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd. The service owners have a strong philosophy, policies and procedures and a framework for monitoring health and safety. An area manager works in partnership with the centre director to support the effective operation of the centre.</p><p>The areas for review and development identified in the April 2011 ERO report, including interactions, group planning and self review have been successfully addressed. The centre director has identified that aspects of long and short-term planning and evaluation could be further improved to build on the good practices evident during this review. The service philosophy of providing children with security, love and learning, is well reflected in centre practices and documentation.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews in the Kindercare Learning Centres Service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children across the centre benefit from secure and responsive relationships with teachers.</p><p>Teachers are friendly, welcoming and caring. They focus strongly on promoting children’s wellbeing and belonging. Children enjoy a calm, slow pace that allows them time and space to lead their own learning.</p><p>Teachers notice and respond to children’s interests well and effectively use teachable moments to engage children in learning and play. They involve children in learning conversations that help them to think more deeply, extend their ideas, and their oral language. Children are confident to share and develop their ideas with each other, particularly through imaginative role play. Children are confident, express themselves well, and demonstrate a good sense of belonging.</p><p>The centre provides children with an attractive, well-managed environment that inspires their curiosity and exploration. Individual and group interests are well fostered through the provision of good quality resources and learning opportunities. Children’s transition into the centre, and between rooms, is responsive to children’s capabilities and parents' preferences. Shared outdoor spaces between classrooms help children to build and maintain relationships as they move through the centre.</p><p>Teachers are respectful and sensitive in the ways in which they work to meet the individual needs of infants and toddlers. Teachers recognise that continuity and consistency of routines, and relationships provide a good foundation for children as they move through the centre.</p><p>Children with diverse needs are well supported within an inclusive centre culture and learning programmes.</p><p>All children have many opportunities to develop their understanding of te ao Māori in ways that are meaningful and respectful of the Māori culture.</p><p>All staff are welcoming of children and their parents. They value the views of parents and encourage their participation in children’s learning. Teachers have a good knowledge of children and this helps them to make meaningful links to family and home. Parents are well informed about their children’s interests and participation in the programme through attractive and informative portfolios and wall displays.</p><p>The centre director fosters relationships that are based on respect and trust. She works well with teachers to achieve the philosophy, vision and goals through a shared understanding of effective ways of working with children and their families.</p><p>Leaders have developed useful links to local schools and the community to support families. Teachers are provided with many opportunities to grow their leadership potential.</p><p>Centre leaders use a systematic process to effectively guide self review that supports ongoing improvement across the centre. The outcomes of review are used by teachers to make improvements to learning and teaching. Teachers’ reflective processes are well developed and supported through reflective journals. Appraisal processes are effectively used to improve the quality of learning and teaching. The centre ensures teachers are well supported by specific individual and team professional development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre’s operation and curriculum is guided by the Kindercare service’s strategic goals. Senior managers have recently extended the strategic plan to identify indicators of success for their goals. They have identified that the next steps are to support each centre to:</p><ul>
<li>develop long-term and annual planning for the centre so that it can prioritise how it will meet the Kindercare vision and goals</li>
<li>develop a planned approach to self review that aligns to centre priorities and the service’s goals.</li>
<li>Leaders and ERO have identified next steps that will further enrich children’s learning. They include:</li>
<li>identifying and planning intentional teaching strategies that will add value to children’s learning</li>
<li>evaluating the impact of teaching strategies on the learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>making teaching and learning documentation more visible in the under-two area</li>
<li>strengthening child and parent contributions in children’s learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres 209 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres 209 will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>26 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
