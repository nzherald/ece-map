<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Little People Ltd (Learning Centre) is developing its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children. Managers have established systems to support ongoing centre-wide improvement. When these systems are refined and embedded they should lead to improved provisions for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Little People Ltd (Learning Centre) is located in Glenfield, Auckland. The centre provides full day education and care for up to 38 children from the age of three months to five years, and children are catered for in two age groups. The centre is one of two owned by the licensee. The second centre in the next street caters for children over two years of age.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s mission is to provide a stimulating learning environment which is a &lsquo;home away from home&rsquo; for children and their families. Managers and teachers place strong emphasis on developing and maintaining close relationships with parents and wh&#257;nau. Stable staffing has helped to promote and sustain these positive relationships. The majority of teachers are appropriately qualified and registered and are representative of some of the cultures in the centre&rsquo;s community.</p><p>Centre managers should continue to progress curriculum management systems that respond to children&rsquo;s interests, as recommended in the 2010 ERO report.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Relationships between children and adults are respectful and support children&rsquo;s learning. Children are settled and socialise well with their peers. They enjoy opportunities for individual and group play within a calm learning environment. Teachers support children to make choices from a range of learning activities. They implement a programme that minimises interruptions to children&rsquo;s play.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to children and provide individualised care for infants and toddlers. They manage the transitions between the two areas as children age and develop so that the change for children is gradual and responds to their growing confidence.</p><p>The centre curriculum is becoming more responsive to children&rsquo;s interests. Teachers generally listen carefully to and respond to children. They encourage them to express their ideas and suggestions.</p><p>Teachers are increasingly confident in using te reo M&#257;ori and integrating tikanga M&#257;ori into the programme, environment and teaching practices. They are developing more collaborative approaches to teaching and work well as a team.</p><p>The centre operates under a sound organisational structure. Governance, management and teaching leadership roles are clearly defined. The professional development of teachers is valued and supported. Teachers are reflective and have opportunities to share their learning through discussions. Centre managers now monitor teaching more closely and help teachers to make improvements in their practice.</p><p>Managers and teachers have begun to review the values articulated in the centre&rsquo;s philosophy. They acknowledge that the philosophy could be more explicit in outlining how they intend to implement good quality learning outcomes for children. A review of the centre&rsquo;s philosophy and how well it is implemented could provide an opportunity to review the education and care for children up to two years of age.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers agree that key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>ensure all teachers engage children in high levels of conversation throughout the day</li>
<li>develop the centre curriculum so it is more responsive to children and to ensure that it offers children more complex and stimulating learning experiences</li>
<li>continue to develop ways for teachers to reflect on their teaching and to consider the impact of their practice on children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>align teacher performance appraisal to the Registered Teacher Criteria</li>
<li>include how the curriculum will be developed and improved over time in the centre&rsquo;s strategic plan.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Little People Ltd (Learning Centre) completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.Click here to enter text.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>20 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues.
