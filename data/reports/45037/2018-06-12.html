</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>First Steps Abacus is situated in Taupō. It provides full-day education and care for children from birth to school age in two rooms. It is licensed for 37 children, including 10 up to the age of two years. The current roll of 52 includes 21 children of Māori descent, and eight from a range of other ethnicities.</p><p>The centre's vision is to develop a sense of belonging for children, celebrate who they are and where they have come from and enable them to become confident and capable learners. The centre's philosophy has four main areas of focus; belonging - te turangawaewae, being - te tu tamaiti, becoming - te tiakitanga and growing together - te tautoko.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in 2013, there have been many changes to staff. The centre has changed its name from Abacus Childcare to First Steps Abacus. The governing organisation has also changed its name from Kidicorp to BestStart Education and Care, and has become a not-for-profit organisation. The centre has an area manager who provides professional leadership and business management. The centre manager is supported in her role by an assistant manager and head teacher. There is one additional teacher who is fully qualified, three teachers in training and one caregiver.</p><p>In addition, since the 2013 ERO review the centre has converted an existing area into an administration office and purchased an additional building for a new non-contact space for staff. The centre has made progress in addressing the areas identified in the previous report. It has developed links with the local Tūwharetoa iwi, and is an active member of the Taupō Community of Learning|Kāhui Ako.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The curriculum responds well to children’s interests and needs. There are many opportunities for children to engage in meaningful learning, exercise choice and capably self manage. Māori children’s heritage and culture are affirmed through bicultural practices and through the use of te reo Māori, which is also evident in children's learning portfolios. The assessment, planning and evaluation process for children's learning has recently been reviewed. There is a strong focus on an individual planning system for all children. There are positive and supportive transitions into and out of the centre. Children are confident and independent learners.</p><p>There are responsive and respectful relationships between teachers and children. Teachers adapt the environment to enrich, revisit and extend learning for children. They foster children’s friendships and social skills. To improve outcomes for children, teachers are actively engaging in relevant inquiries. Effective teaching practice is evident through intentional teaching and teacher involvement in child-initiated play. Children experience a sense of belonging and wellbeing.</p><p>Children up to the age of two have their individual needs and routines well met. Teachers encourage children to problem solve, explore and master physical skills. Well-supported transitions into and within the centre, address the individual needs of children and their families.</p><p>Leadership is highly collaborative and includes strong relational trust. Leaders are developing teacher capability through appraisal and are modelling effective practice. There is open communication with parents, families and whānau whose views and aspirations are sought. Parents feel welcome in the centre.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well identified and leaders have strengthened relationships with external agencies to support the learning and development of these children. A supportive learning culture enables positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The governing organisation has strong systems and processes to guide centre operations. Centre priorities are well aligned to the overarching strategic plan, vision and goals. There is regular consultation with parents and staff and a commitment to children and staff wellbeing through targeted programmes. Extensive opportunities for professional learning and development are provided and there is a strategic approach to growing leaders within the organisation. Effective internal evaluation focuses on improved practice and outcomes for children. Children benefit from high-quality education and care.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree the next steps for this centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>embed the new assessment, planning and evaluation system to strengthen progression of learning over time and links to parent aspirations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the integration of literacy and mathematics learning, particularly in the outdoor environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to plan for the ongoing maintenance and upgrading of the physical environment and resources, including hazard identification, to ensure a safe and attractive environment for learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of First Steps Abacus completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of First Steps Abacus will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>12 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
