</table><p>Hampstead Free Kindergarten is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hampstead Kindergarten is one of five kindergartens administered by the Ashburton Kindergarten Association. A manager oversees the association under the governance of a board. An education service manager provides advice and guidance to teachers on the curriculum and programme. The head teacher manages the day-to-day operation of the kindergarten. The kindergarten provides care and education for children from two years old until school age.</p><p>Since the March 2011 ERO review, there have been changes in staff, and an increase in Māori and Pacific families attending the kindergarten.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews in the Ashburton Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a programme where they can lead their own learning, regulate their time, make choices and decisions about their learning, and develop problem-solving skills.</p><p>Teachers place emphasis on supporting children to develop successful relationships with others and effective social skills. This includes a focus on cooperation, collaboration, taking turns and supporting children to teach and learn from each other (ako).</p><p>Children benefit from a well-resourced, spacious learning environment. Resources that promote literacy such as books, music, writing tools and displays were very evident in the kindergarten environment and well used by children.</p><p>Teachers respond well to children’s interests and reflect on positive strategies that support children’s learning. They make good use of research and professional development opportunities to improve practice and increase teacher’s knowledge. Teachers are making good use of the appraisal system to reflect on their teaching and receive feedback.</p><p>Teachers use positive and effective strategies to support children’s learning. They regularly listen and respond to children’s ideas and encourage them to wonder about things, set their own challenges and find answers to their own questions. Children are encouraged to develop self-help skills.</p><p>Teachers promote a welcoming and inclusive environment. Leaders and teachers have a strong awareness of priority learners and their needs. They actively seek ways to help children with the greatest learning needs have a successful learning experience at the kindergarten. This includes a ‘no fees’ policy, targeted professional development and an awareness of larger education plans to support these learners. They make good use of external specialists when needed. Māori children are able to succeed and learn as Māori. Both Māori and Pacific cultures are visible in kindergarten environment.</p><p>Leaders are focused on valuing and respecting the needs, interests and backgrounds of children attending the service and their families. They are strong advocates for children and their families. The education service manager is providing useful guidance and advice to the teaching team. The introduction of indicators of good practice is helping teachers reflect more deeply on their practice and outcomes for children. Teachers have also revisited the kindergarten vision and are making better use of this to guide self review.</p><p>Teachers have positive relationships with whānau. They provide opportunities for parents to contribute the views and aspirations they have for their children’s learning.</p><p>The kindergarten association has a comprehensive policy and procedure framework in place to provide good guidance for kindergarten operations and the monitoring of health and safety. Association goals are well known by all staff. These appropriately include a goal focused on promoting leadership. Since the 2011 ERO review, the association has improved the quality of the information the manager receives about the effectiveness of each kindergarten’s programme. The association initiative of employing a speech language therapist to work with identified children is resulting in improved learning outcomes for some children and providing helpful additional support for families and teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers and teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps for improving outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening planning and assessment practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving the documentation of self review to more clearly show the robustness of the process followed, what changes have been made and the impact of these changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers becoming more proactive in using children’s home languages (Pacific and Māori) during the programme and increasing their understanding of the Māori values already evident in the programme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building on existing practices to further strengthen relationships with Pacific families and support children and families who do not have English as a first language.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The new board has identified that they require more training to familiarise themselves with their roles and responsibilities, and further develop the following areas of governance:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>association strategic planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the board’s role in supporting kindergartens to respond to priority learners within their communities, such as the growing populations of children and families from Māori and Pacific backgrounds and children who do not have English as their first language.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hampstead Free Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hampstead Free Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>29 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
