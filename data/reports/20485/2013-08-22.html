</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tots Corner in Northcote is a well established early childhood centre that offers education and care for children from birth to school age. In 2012 the centre was relicensed under the 2008 Early Childhood Regulations.</p><p>The centre has a history of positive ERO reports that affirm the provision of effective leadership and high quality programmes for children. These characteristics continue to define the centre.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy is reflected in the programme, through an education model from northern Italy that is complementary to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. Professional development has resulted in teachers promoting education as a process that is collaborative and recognises children, parents and whānau as valuable partners.</p><p>A commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi is evident in the programme. Success for Māori and Pacific children is acknowledged through respectful and sensitive partnerships with whānau and families.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are highly engaged in the centre programme. Purposeful learning experiences and good use of resources support them to develop as confident and competent learners. Children can sustain their interests for long periods as they play either independently or with other children. They initiate their own learning and teachers support children’s play well.</p><p>Well resourced learning areas encourage children to explore the environment, and promote their curiosity and theorising about the world they live in. Good use of space allows children to extend and develop their imaginative play and experiences.</p><p>Partnerships with parents and whānau are valued and acknowledged by teachers and the manager. The knowledge, skill and expertise that whānau Māori and other cultural groups bring to the service is respected and appreciated. Teachers’ knowledge of waiata and karakia helps to extend children’s thinking and fosters their understanding of New Zealand’s bicultural heritage.</p><p>Children’s interests are supported through books, internet-based resources, and by asking local community specialists, families, tangata whenua and tangata Pasifika to contribute to the learning programme.</p><p>Managers and teachers use self review to reflect on their practice and recognise the value of children learning through play. They regularly discuss and review the impact of curriculum decisions on infants, toddlers and young children. <em>Te Whāriki</em> is used as a basis for evaluating the programme to promote ongoing enrichment of children’s learning and development.</p><p>Managers implement highly effective planning systems, policies and procedures that are regularly reviewed for their effectiveness. This systematic self review has lead to improved outcomes for children. Centre staff have a good understanding of the dual purpose of self review, leading to improvement and accountability. Professional development is budgeted generously for and collaborative leadership provides opportunities for all teachers to become effective practitioners.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager, leaders and ERO agree that a key next step is to continue to strengthen the bicultural focus across all aspects of centre operations.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tots Corner completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tots Corner will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>22 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
