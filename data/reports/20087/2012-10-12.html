<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2>
<h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3>
<p>Kindercare Learning Centre (8P) in Pakuranga is continuing to build its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children. The centre is trialling new ways of working across the six rooms that make up this early childhood service. While these new methods will take some time to establish, the positive outcomes seen in those rooms already using the new methods are providing satisfaction for children and teachers.</p>
<h4>Context</h4>
<p>Kindercare Learning Centre (8P) is part of a complex that operates under two early childhood licences. This licence provides care for 50 children over the age of two years in three age-grouped rooms. Children come from the local community and represent a number of ethnicities. The centre is managed in accordance with the Kindercare philosophy, policies and procedures that provide guidance for the operation of the service.</p>
<p>Kindercare&rsquo;s philosophy outlines the intentions of the service to provide an environment where children feel safe and loved, and where learning is fun. New methods of implementing programmes are proving effective in meeting these goals. Children in these rooms show the benefit of more relaxed routines and are calm and happy in their play.</p>
<p>Staffing for the service has been generally stable since the 2009 ERO review. As a result there are well established patterns of work and strong collegial relationships across teaching teams. Teachers report that professional development provided by Kindercare Centres is building their professionalism and generating improvements in the programme.</p>
<p>If the centre is part of a cluster review, select context from drop-down</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Teachers and children enjoy friendly relationships. Teachers are caring and attentive with children. They work in responsive ways that recognise individual needs and preferences. The programme offers children a blend of structured and free play. Recent training about the foundations for learning in literacy, numeracy and science is beginning to have an impact on children&rsquo;s learning in these programmes. The centre manager has plans to extend new programmes that are more strongly based on children&rsquo;s interests.</p>
<p>Teachers have established strong relationships with the local marae. Careful training enabled teachers and children to confidently engage with protocols during marae visits. Teachers use, and children demonstrate familiarity with te reo M&#257;ori. Several teachers plan to build their confidence in using te reo M&#257;ori.</p>
<p>Throughout the centre teachers create environments that support children&rsquo;s learning. A recent focus on de-cluttering environments has improved children&rsquo;s access to resources and established discrete areas for different types of play. Upgrading to the outdoor areas now provides a greater range of physical opportunities and challenge for children.</p>
<p>Teachers&rsquo; self-review practices inform their decision making and provide directions for improvement. Teachers&rsquo; reflections contribute effectively to appraisal and teacher registration processes.</p>
<p>Centre managers and ERO agree on next priorities for development could include:</p>
<ul><li>continuing to strengthen interactions that further encourage children&rsquo;s problem solving and thinking skills</li>
<li>further enhancing children&rsquo;s social competence through the development of teaching practice</li>
<li>sharing reflections based on research to strengthen effective practices</li>
<li>continuing with the focus on embedding new planning systems that include responding to children&rsquo;s interests and strengths.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Kindercare Learning Centres (8P) completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>

<h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p>

<h4>About ERO Reviews</h4>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>Review focus</h3>
<p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p>
<p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
<p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p></html>
