</table><p>Lakeview Private Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lakeview Private Kindergarten in Takapuna provides sessional and full-day education and care for children from two to five years of age. In 2018, the owner, who maintains a strong involvement in the kindergarten operations, promoted the supervisor to a centre manager role. The manager works with an assistant manager.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is consistent with the intentions of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. It recognises the importance of providing an inclusive environment that promotes self-help and independence, and where children have opportunities to learn through play. The philosophy promotes partnerships with parents/whānau.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report commented positively about centre management and leadership, the quality of teaching, and learning opportunities for children. It recognised progress in using te reo Māori and in planning and assessment. Areas for development related to challenging children’s thinking and extending their learning, building teachers’ capacity to evaluate their professional practice, and strategic planning.</p><p>The service is a member of the Pupuke (Westlake) Community of Learning | Kāhui Ako.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children continue to benefit from positive relationships with teachers and each other. They learn in an environment that promotes their independence and allows them to follow their interests.</p><p>Teachers' interactions with children are positive and affirming, and support children's language and cognitive development. Teachers make time to listen to children and engage them in conversations about their play. They implement care routines sensitively and respectfully for each child. Children with additional learning needs are well supported.</p><p>The learning environment has been developed well to support children's learning through play. Children can access a wide range of equipment and open-ended resources in the main play areas, including the outdoor area. The mixed-age group promotes tuakana/teina relationships with the younger children learning from the older children.</p><p>Children's literacy and numeracy learning is promoted through resources used and conversations in the context of play. The phonics programme for four-year olds should now be reviewed to ensure that it reflects the centre's philosophy and current best practice in early childhood education.</p><p>The centre has made a commitment to include te reo and tikanga Māori in the programme. Teachers' confidence in this area is growing, and well supported through professional learning and development. Te reo and tikanga Māori are particularly evident in some areas of the programme and in the environment.</p><p>Staff know the children and their families well and work in partnership with parents. Communications between the centre and parents/whānau are well developed, using face-to-face discussions and electronic tools. Parent contributions are especially apparent in some children's learning portfolios. Parents are consulted about and involved in a variety of areas of centre operations.</p><p>Recent professional learning related to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, has prompted a review of teachers' assessment of children's learning and programme planning. Teachers are currently exploring ways to document how they intend to plan responses to opportunities for extending children's learning.</p><p>There is a culture of ongoing improvement in the centre. Teachers are motivated and supported to improve their practice. They participate in relevant and significant professional learning and an effective appraisal system that encourages reflection on professional practice. Internal evaluation is used to guide changes to centre operations. Strategic planning would be strengthened by documenting improvement goals and how these goals will be met.</p><p>The centre is well managed. The centre's philosophy and an up-to-date policy framework guide decision making and promote teacher reflections. The centre owner, a registered teacher, takes a keen interest in all aspect of centre operations and is well supported by centre managers. Together, they have engaged with the Kāhui Ako, and especially with local primary schools.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening strategic planning by developing action plans that guide staff to achieve documented strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen the centre's bicultural curriculum by increasing the use of te reo Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refining planning processes by more clearly documenting intentional teaching plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that the methods of supporting early literacy development are consistent with the centre's philosophy and <em>Te Whāriki</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lakeview Private Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to strengthen current practice, teachers should document in greater depth how they will manage risks related to excursions.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>1 July 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
