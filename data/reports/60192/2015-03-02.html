</table><p>Grafton Private Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Grafton Private Kindergarten is located in the Kapiti community of Paraparaumu. The service has been operating for 25 years. Children and families come to this kindergarten from a wide geographical area, from Raumati South through to North Beach, Paraparaumu.</p><p>The education and care service is privately owned, operated and managed by the owner. A newly-established collaborative leadership model has been set up. Two centre supervisors lead the day-to-day operations of the kindergarten. The all-day service is licensed for up to 32 children aged over two years. Of the 55 children enrolled six are Māori. </p><p>The vision statement and philosophy of the service is incorporated through centre practices. The centre philosophy prioritises ‘a happy learning environment which will foster children’s physical, emotional, social, creative and cognitive development, whilst acknowledging their background and family values.’ Te Whāriki, the early childhood curriculum, guides children’s engagement through learning experiences and interactions which are fun and encourage a lifelong love of learning.</p><p>Respectful relationships between staff, parents and families support children's learning.The identified centre strengths in the March 2012 ERO report have been sustained. Recommendations and areas identified for further development at that time have been progressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience positive, warm and caring relationships with teachers and other children. Wellbeing and social competence are prioritised and supported. The rhythms of the children are observed, and teacher interactions and interventions are responsive and respectful.</p><p>The tone is settled and calm. Teachers know the children well, highlighting their individual needs, interests and strengths. A well-considered approach to encouraging children’s independence is evident.</p><p>Children demonstrate confidence and capability in leading their own learning. The programme offers opportunities for individual preference and choice. Teacher-led and child-led learning are integral to centre practice. A wide range of open-ended resources successfully supports children’s learning through exploration and creativity.</p><p>Mathematics, numeracy and literacy skills are intentionally planned for and learning experiences for children are enriched through daily routines and experiences.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation appropriately include ongoing reflection about children’s learning. Teachers are developing consistency and collective capability through collaborating, being responsive and sharing what children learn. The’ Planning Board’ highlights learning interactions, experiences and progress for individuals and groups.</p><p>Children’s profiles include narrative assessments of children’s interests and learning. Progressions are highlighted through Te Whāriki goals and learning outcomes. These narratives inform individual and group planning. Teachers collaborate about how to further develop children's learning and thinking. ERO agrees with leaders that building team consistency in assessment and evaluation processes needs further development.</p><p>The curriculum is well designed by teachers to acknowledge and include children’s language and culture. Te ao Māori contexts, symbols and natural resources are woven through the learning environment. Te reo Māori is purposefully included and children listen and respond. Kapa haka is led weekly by a community facilitator.</p><p>ERO agrees with leaders that te reo Māori and te ao Māori need to be further developed by teachers and included across the curriculum. Leaders also identify Japanese language and culture as a future focus.Transition into the service and on to school varies for individual children. Preschool meetings occur, new entrant teachers are invited into the centre and the centre ‘Club’ programme all support children’s transition.</p><p>Leaders promote positive outcomes for children, parents and whānau through effective systems and processes. A newly-developed appraisal system provides purposeful feedback and guidance for teaching practice. Teachers reflect on planning and assessment outcomes to support children’s learning.</p><p>Self review contributes successfully to decision making. Staff, parents and whānau work collaboratively. Review is leading to improvement in processes and practice, and generating positive outcomes for children. ERO agrees with leaders that further developing teacher consistency, understanding and implementation of self review are needed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre management and ERO agree that key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the quality of assessment, planning and evaluation processes centre-wide by building team capability and consistency</li>
<li>further develop te reo Māori and te ao Māori across the curriculum through the use of Ka Hikitia: Accelerating Success 2013-2017 and Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners, to support teachers to be more responsive to Māori children’s culture, language and identity</li>
<li>strengthen the quality of self review by developing team knowledge, understanding and consistency of the service's self-review process </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Grafton Private Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Grafton Private Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>2 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><em>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</em></a>.</p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><p>• Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years • Well placed – The next ERO review in three years • Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years • Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
