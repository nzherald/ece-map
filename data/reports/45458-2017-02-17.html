</table><p>Improvements are required in teaching and learning and curriculum implementation to better reflect the kindergarten's stated priorities. Review and internal evaluation for improvement is not well understood.</p><p>Stronger leadership and a collaborative partnership with the board is required to move forward</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Haleema Kindergarten provides an all-day education and care service and is situated beside the Islamic Centre in Taita, Lower Hutt. The service is licenced for 40 children over two years of age. The centre is purpose built and governed by the non-profit organisation the Haleema Trust. The roll reflects a diverse range of nationalities. The programme is based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>,the early childhood curriculum and has an emphasis on Islamic teaching and values.</p><p>A centre manager has oversight of the management and administration of the centre. The head teacher is responsible for the day-to-day running of the service, including curriculum developments and the quality of teaching. The centre has participated in an Increasing Participation Project with the Ministry of Education in 2015-2016.</p><p>The February 2014 ERO report, identified a number of areas requiring further development. These included leadership, teaching and learning, assessment, planning and evaluation, self review, appraisal and improving cultural responsiveness. Insufficient progress is evident in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and families are warmly welcomed by teachers. Children's interests are recognised by teachers who provide relevant resources to support them in their play. Teachers know children well and engage in conversations with them about things of interest to them. A next step is for teachers to consistently support children's developing social competence and independence skills.</p><p>Centre practice does not yet support the outcomes identified in the philosophy. Leaders should establish clear expectations to guide teacher practice and consider how these curriculum priorities should be reflected through all aspects of the curriculum, assessment practices and review and internal evaluation.</p><p>Stronger curriculum leadership is required to guide and support teachers' understanding and the enactment of all aspects of the kindergarten philosophy, assessment practice, review and internal evaluation to improve outcomes for all children.</p><p>A number of centre routines interrupt children's access to the play-based curriculum. Leaders should reflect on the amount of time children spend in group teaching or involved in routine times and consider how the structure of the day can better reflect the play-based focus identified in the kindergarten philosophy.</p><p>Some aspects of bicultural practice are reflected in the programme, but practice requires strengthening. Teachers should also consider how they can better reflect te ao Māori throughout the curriculum and increase their use of te reo Māori.</p><p>Reflecting all children's cultures, languages and identities throughout the curriculum, and planning and assessment remains an area for further development.</p><p>The centre-wide approach to planning is relatively new. These developments are in the early stages of implementation. As this process develops, attention should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clearly identifying the planned learning outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>well defined teaching strategies that are targeted to support the learning outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>following all aspects of the assessment, planning and evaluation cycle.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Once established the programme planning and evaluation policy and procedures should then be reviewed to ensure these align with and guide practice.</p><p>Children's individual portfolios highlight their engagement in the programme and emerging interests. Assessment practices require further development. Teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>analyse the learning for the individual in greater depth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have a stronger focus on considering their role in adding depth and complexity to children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly highlight children's progression in their learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>An appraisal process is in place and work has begun on developing a shared understanding of the attestation process. The centre manager has not yet been appraised. Ongoing improvement is required and this should focus on establishing a regular cycle of appraisal meetings, the use of clear, specific and measurable goals and leaders carrying out targeted observations of teacher practice.</p><p>Teachers should also be supported in their understanding of how they can address all requirements for the endorsement of their practising certificate. An appraisal policy and procedures should then be developed to reflect the agreed process and enacted in practice.</p><p>Limited progress has been made in using review and evaluation to determine the impact of teaching practice and the curriculum on outcomes for children. Leaders and teachers should further develop their understanding of review and evaluation.</p><p>The recently appointed centre manager has a liaison role between the board of trustees and teachers. The board is well informed of centre operation. Meeting their commitments for supporting centre operation in a more timely way would be beneficial. </p><h3>Priorities for improvement</h3><p>Stronger leadership is required in supporting teachers to enact identified priorities throughout all aspects of the curriculum. Leaders and staff need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop clear expectations to guide teacher practice and reflect centre priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistently support children's developing social competence and independence skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the bicultural programme and capitalise on the strengths all children bring from diverse cultures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve their understanding of assessment for learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build their understanding of review and internal evaluation, including teacher appraisal.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, the board of trustees should be more responsive in managing the centre's financial commitments.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Haleema Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>heavy furniture, fixtures and equipment that could fall or topple and cause serious injury or damage should be secured</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self review and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>police vetting of non teacher-registered staff.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, Regulation 45, HS6, GMA6,</em> Education Act 1989, section 78c<em>]</em> </p><p>To improve practice leaders should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review policies and procedures in line with changes made as result of the Vulnerable Children Act 2014</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>revisit and improve procedures relating to sleeping children and medication forms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>update the accident / injury policy to reflect current Ministry of Education requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistently enact the kindergartens sun safe policy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>annually appraise the centre manager.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the onsite phase of the review some of the identified areas to improve practice have been addressed.</p><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Haleema Kindergarten. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Haleema Kindergarten will be in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>17 February 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
