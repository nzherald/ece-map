</table><p>Little Ones Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Ones Early Learning Centre is a small privately-owned centre in Edendale, Southland. The owner is also the manager and a qualified early childhood teacher. She has a second centre in Invercargill. Most of the staff are registered teachers. Two teachers are not qualified but have had long experience in early childhood education. There has been little change in staffing over time.</p><p>Children from birth-to-school age attend the centre. Infants and toddlers play and learn in a separate building from the children at the preschool. Both groups share a large outdoor area. Mixed-age interactions are encouraged. The centre provides food for the children.</p><p>The centre's philosophy states that it will provide a home away from home, where children experience loving, respectful, caring |manaakitanga relationships. It also states that children will learn through meaningful, open-ended play and be seen as capable and confident. Taking responsibility and independence will be encouraged.</p><p>Most of the recommendations from the 2016 ERO report have been addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play and learn in a calm, unhurried and home-like environment. Teachers are respectful and caring in their interactions with them. Children settle quickly on arrival and show a strong sense of belonging to their centre. They show sustained interest in activities and play well independently, alongside and with others. Centre routines are adapted to be responsive to individual children's needs and wishes.</p><p>The curriculum fosters open-ended, child-led play. Core Māori values, such as manaakitanga, whanaungatanga and tuakana-teina relationships are very evident. There is also a strong focus on building children's social and emotional competence, independence, sense of responsibility and having choice. Children have good opportunities for dramatic play, learning about aspects of te ao Māori, and exploration of the natural world.</p><p>Aspects of planning and assessment contribute well to learning. Teachers collectively discuss individual children and identify relevant learning goals. The best learning story examples link back to a child's goal, show progress against it and explain how teachers have supported that learning. Teachers regularly talk with parents about their children's wellbeing, play and learning.</p><p>Children with particular needs, such as infants, toddlers and children transitioning into and through the centre and then on to school, are very well supported. This support includes additional resourcing, deliberate teaching strategies and close communication with parents. Infants and toddlers benefit from very close, nurturing relationships with their key teachers who know them and their families very well.</p><p>The manager provides good support for staff professional learning and wellbeing. Teachers have access to relevant professional development and their strengths and interests are valued. They work in collegial ways to best support the children. Findings from robust planned internal evaluations are used to make informed changes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Aspects of individual and group planning need strengthening. Presently, individual goals and group-plan learning outcomes are not clear to all staff and parents. Plans also need more detail about the strategies that teachers will use to support children's learning. Clarity about learning goals or outcomes and teaching strategies should enable teachers to better evaluate the effectiveness of their work in supporting the intended learning. There is also variability in the quality of individual learning stories.</p><p>Some aspects of curriculum could be strengthened. It is timely for leaders and teachers to review:</p><ul>
<li>how well children's oral language, early literacy and mathematics learning are supported</li>
<li>resourcing for older children throughout the centre</li>
<li>opportunities for children to revisit prior learning.</li>
</ul><p>Some areas in the centre need to be upgraded and maintenance matters need addressing.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Ones Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>18 July 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"></a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
