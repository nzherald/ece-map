</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>This is a new centre. Leadership of teaching and learning and aspects of governance and review need to be strengthened. ERO is confident that with support the centre can make the necessary improvements.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Hope Preschool opened in March 2014 and became a fully licensed early childhood service in 2015. This is its first ERO review.</p><p>The centre is attached to a local church. Its vision is to promote Christian values, enable local children to access quality early-childhood education and to support parents. Leaders need to make improvements to more fully realise this vision.</p><p>Since it opened, its roll has steadily grown. In a short time, the trust and staff have established an attractive and well-resourced centre. The spacious indoor and outdoor areas provide inviting areas for children to play in.</p><p>The centre is governed by a charitable trust. A manager oversees the day-to-day running of the centre and a head teacher is responsible for teaching and learning. The manager and trust show a strong commitment to provide the best for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from the calm environment that staff have created. They are purposeful and busy in their play and enjoy their interactions with their teachers. ERO observed frequent conversations between children and their teachers and children involved in play and/or particular activities for sustained periods of time.</p><p>Children enjoy the affirmation and acknowledgement they get from their teachers. Teachers play alongside them and support their imaginative games. Teachers notice children’s dispositions, such as curiosity, and respond to these. They allow children to lead their play and follow children’s interests.</p><p>A culture of care (manaakitanga) is evident and deliberately fostered throughout the centre. Respect is modelled, encouraged and explicitly taught.</p><p>Children know and follow well-established routines. They have good opportunities and resources for physical play, problem solving and challenge. The open layout of the centre ensures children have appropriate space, and spaces for their play.</p><p>There is a deliberate focus on building children’s independence. Children are shown how to manage their own care and take responsibility, and encouraged to do so. Teachers guide children in their interactions in positive ways. They prompt children to use appropriate language when managing conflict.</p><p>Kai (food) time is well used as a time for children’s learning. Children learn to sit and eat together and with their teachers. They practise taking turns and sharing food. They converse with their teachers and each other, and their social skills are encouraged.</p><p>Children enjoy a range of experiences. Some learning focuses, such as ANZAC and Mātariki celebrations, are sustained over a period of time. These lead to a variety of interesting learning activities. Parents and other family members sometimes share their ideas and skills related to group learning.</p><p>Four-year old children join a transition programme. This programme focuses on readiness for school and includes early literacy, mathematics and social skills. Teachers need to document their planning for this and think about how to integrate these areas more into day-to-day play.</p><p>Past records show planning for small and large-group activities. These plans have a learning focus and involve teachers finding resources to support the intended learning. Future plans will need to describe in more detail the strategies teachers intend to use to support children’s learning. Evaluations of these plans need to consider what difference these strategies have made to their learning.</p><p>The trust board is committed to the development and improvement of the centre. Most trustees have past experience in governance and/or financial management. The board receives regular reports from the manager and head teacher but these and board minutes need more detail and coverage.</p><p>Most policies and procedures are in place and a cycle of review of these has begun. The board prioritises professional support for its staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Overall, there needs to be a more deliberate focus on extending children’s learning. Past planning and assessment (i.e. learning stories) for children have been insufficient. Whilst ERO found some very good learning story examples, the quality of these varied and some children had few. Centre leaders need to develop clear expectations and guidelines for planning, assessment and evaluation of children’s learning.</p><p>Teachers need to:</p><ul>
<li>ensure children have more opportunities to learn about aspects of Māori culture, including te reo Māori</li>
<li>describe in more detail the strategies they will use to support individuals (especially those with special needs) and group learning</li>
<li>regularly record what parents want their children to learn and show how they have responded to this</li>
<li>ensure that learning stories show the progress each child has made over time</li>
<li>evaluate more deeply the impact of their strategies to support children’s learning.</li>
</ul><p>Leadership of teaching and learning needs to be strengthened. Provisionally registered teachers need better support so that they meet the requirements for full registration. Past appraisals of teachers were not completed. The appraisal process needs to better support teachers to continually improve their practice. Leadership of professional learning could be improved.</p><p>Trustees, centre leaders and teachers need to build their understanding and use of self review. Reviews need to be evaluative (ask how well), involve gathering evidence and lead to well-informed change and improvement. The scope of reviews needs to be extended to include areas such as teaching and learning. It is timely to review and expand the centre philosophy so that it includes other teaching and learning priorities.</p><p>To ensure strong governance and management, next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>developing long and short-term plans (strategic and annual) to guide the centre’s development</li>
<li>developing guidelines for the roles and responsibilities of trustees and other key governance areas</li>
<li>ensuring systems are in place so that the centre meets all legal requirements, such as appraisal of staff and support of provisionally registered teachers</li>
<li>extending management reports and meeting minutes to better cover areas such as health and safety, personnel matters, roll information and self-review outcomes</li>
<li>extending and/or developing policies/procedures related to appraisal, appointments, and a bicultural curriculum.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hope Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to the appraisal of the head teacher and teachers. In 2013 and 2014 the head teacher was not appraised. Some 2015 appraisals are incomplete. To meet requirements the service needs to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure all staff are appraised according to the Education Council guidelines and the <em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008.</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hope Preschool will be within two years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>23 February 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
