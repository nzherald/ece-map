</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Phillipstown in east Christchurch provides care and education for a diverse community of learners. The teachers foster an inclusive environment for all children and their families. The cultural and educational needs of children are given priority. Teachers work positively with families and a number of outside agencies to help children with specific learning challenges experience success.</p><p>This review was a part of a cluster of 11 kindergartens governed and managed by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The kindergarten was affected immediately after the Canterbury earthquakes by a drop in the roll. The roll has since risen as families have returned to the area.</p><p>The kindergarten is a focal point for the local community. A shared, sustainable garden is open to the community. Children and adults learn together about caring for the environment and other sustainable practices.</p><p>Since the June 2010 ERO, there has been a number of changes to leadership and to the teaching team. A new head teacher was appointed in Term 3, 2013 after acting in this position for a year.</p><p>The previous and current teaching teams have made good progress in addressing the recommendations in the 2010 ERO report. Children’s learning interests and achievements are now easier for children and parents to see and revisit. Self review has also been strengthened with some useful reviews leading to improvements to the programme and practices.</p><p>The association reports that as a result of this initiative, children’s attendance at kindergarten has increased, particularly in areas where there are high numbers of priority learners. All teachers are fully qualified in early childhood education.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers establish supportive and respectful relationships with children and families. They have a positive view of all children as capable and confident learners. They work with children in sensitive and caring ways to extend their learning.</p><p>Teachers are aware of the need to maintain children’s connections to their culture and first language. Partnerships in learning with parents/whānau are actively promoted.</p><p>Children are encouraged to take increasing responsibility for themselves and the wellbeing of others. Teachers ensure that children who require additional support for their learning participate fully in the programme with and alongside their peers.</p><p>Children’s language development is given priority. Teachers encourage children to share their experiences and ideas with their peers and adults. Children play and learn well together for sustained periods of time.</p><p>Children’s leadership is actively supported. Teachers encourage children to learn from each other and share their knowledge and skills. These learning qualities, along with others already reported above, help children make a successful transition as they move on to school.</p><p>The programme is predominantly led by the children. Teachers are highly responsive to children’s learning interests. Children benefit from a range of stimulating and varied experiences and resources that provoke their curiosity and spark their imagination. Literacy and numeracy experiences are well integrated throughout the programme. Children have good opportunities to develop their thinking, investigative and physical skills. The spacious, natural outdoor area contributes positively to this development.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have a shared understanding of and commitment to the kindergarten’s vision that emphasises bicultural concepts and values. Children have many opportunities to learn about New Zealand’s bicultural heritage in ways that are meaningful and relevant.</p><p>The new teaching team is developing a positive team culture. The head teacher recognises and makes good use of the skills of teachers to lead aspects of the programme.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are making increasing use of a systematic, planned approach to self review to make ongoing improvements to the quality of the programme and teaching practices.</p><p>The association provides effective governance and management for all of its kindergartens. The long-term vision and goals for all kindergartens are determined by the governing board. Each individual kindergarten establishes its own plan incorporating the board's goals. The association responded appropriately to the circumstances of Canterbury and Westland communities by removing all fees.</p><p>Each kindergarten is supported by education support managers (ESMs) who make regular visits and provides well-targeted professional development. In particular, teachers are well supported in developing their understanding of te ao Māori and making this more evident in documentation and practices. This remains an area for further development in this kindergarten.</p><p>The association has high expectations for teaching and learning. The use of recently developed indicators of good practice is helping to identify and spread effective practice. Appraisal is used effectively to recognise areas of strength and where further developments may be necessary.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers have identified, and ERO agrees with the need to continue to build on and strengthen recent initiatives in documenting planning, assessment and evaluation.</p><p>Aspects of self review could be extended to provide more convincing evidence to show why changes have been made to programmes and practices, and how these changes are benefiting children’s learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Phillipstown completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Phillipstown will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>18 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
