</table><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Rushton Road is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Rushton Road is located in the rural township of Morrinsville. It is licensed for 40 children over the age of two years. Currently there are 45 children enrolled, including 16 who identify as Māori.</p><p>The kindergarten’s philosophy is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em> and <em>Te Whatu Pōkeka</em> and is embodied in a whakairo 'Whakaaro nui'. This is a valued taonga of the kindergarten and represents commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi, and symbolises people and places from past, present and future, who are part of the kindergarten community.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the governance and management of the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust, a community not-for-profit organisation. The overarching philosophy of the organisation is to provide kindergartens where children learn through play and are supported to reach their potential.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 kindergarten reviews in the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten has an inclusive curriculum that promotes positive learning outcomes for children. Literacy, mathematics and other curriculum areas are interwoven into daily learning. The environment provides many opportunities for children to be creative and use their imagination. The outside play area includes a range of equipment to provide varying levels of physical challenge. Children engage in sustained and complex learning and are supported to set their own challenges and confidently assess risk. Children with additional needs and their families are well supported. The curriculum is responsive to children’s interests, strengths and abilities.</p><p>There are strong, reciprocal relationships among children, parents and teachers. Parents and whānau feel welcome in the kindergarten and interactions are genuine and respectful. There are many opportunities for children to develop friendships. Tuakana-teina relationships support children’s learning and the development of leadership skills. Relationships foster children's sense of belonging and wellbeing.</p><p>Effective teaching interactions support children’s confidence and competence as life-long learners. Teachers are skilled at noticing children’s interests and responding to potential learning opportunities. They use a range of intentional teaching strategies that encourage children to problem solve and persevere. Children are viewed as capable and supported to develop their confidence through meaningful interactions and play.</p><p>Leadership has a strong commitment to the kindergarten philosophy. Teachers have time to reflect on their practice and contribute to centre-wide review. Internal evaluation processes need to be further developed to better understand how actions support improved outcomes for children. Leaders and teachers are committed to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi and aspects of the programme reflect a bicultural approach. This could be strengthened further by increasing the confidence of teachers to use te reo Māori in their interactions.</p><p>Governance and management have comprehensive, well-established systems and practices to enable the organisation to monitor, evaluate and plan for improvement for its early learning centres. Clear guidelines and expectations for centre practice and curriculum are strongly fostered by the leadership team and trust. The vision and values support positive outcomes for children’s learning, wellbeing and that of their whānau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Next steps for the kindergarten are to:</p><ul>
<li>refine internal evaluation processes to be more systematic, to analyse evidence, and to more clearly identify improved outcomes for children</li>
<li>strengthen assessment processes to include personalised planning for all children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Rushton Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice, Central Kids Kindergarten management needs to ensure observations of teacher practice are undertaken as part of the appraisal process.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Rushton Road will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>1 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
