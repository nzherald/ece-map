</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>St John’s Progressive Childcare Centre is an established community-based centre in Whangarei City. This purpose built centre caters for 70 children from three months to school age. The centre is governed by a volunteer board of trustees and managed by a centre manager and team leaders. In 2012 St John’s Progressive Childcare Centre was reviewed by ERO under two Ministry of Education licences. It now has one licence for both centres. There have been many staff changes since the 2012 ERO reviews.</p><p>Children’s education and care is provided within five age-related groups in two adjacent buildings. A team leader manages the day to day running of each building. In one building there are three groups for infants and toddlers, and in the other building the older children are in two groups. While each age group has a designated area and staff, there is a lot of movement and connection between the groups.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy is consistent with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. It promotes a friendly welcoming environment where manaakitanga and aroha are important. Teachers are encouraged to learn alongside children, respecting their contributions and nurturing their interests and knowledge. Teachers working with the younger children focus on building relationships in a calm learning environment.</p><p>The 2012 ERO reports commented positively on the centres’ commitment to relationships and a bicultural curriculum. Good progress is being made in development areas noted in these reports related to planning and assessment, performance management and self review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s education and wellbeing are well catered for by the centre. Teachers promote children’s learning through play. The values of whanaungatanga, manaakitanga and aroha are evident in the relationships and interactions among the staff, children and parents/whānau. Parents are encouraged to be part of their children’s learning at the centre.</p><p>Children and teachers have high quality conversations that promote their oral language, thinking and the development of social and self-help skills. Children are settled, confident and play well together. They are very respectful of each other and their environment.</p><p>The curriculum is becoming increasingly bicultural. Te reo Māori is becoming an integral part of conversations and written communication as teachers gain knowledge in the language. Centre managers could now review the extent to which the curriculum supports the identity of children from other cultures who attend the centre.</p><p>The education and care of infants and toddlers are well provided for. Teachers ensure that the routines for these children are consistent with their routines at home and are used as learning opportunities. Children are well supported in their transition to the centre and through to their next age group.</p><p>The environment is well organised and resourced and promotes learning. Children have easy access to resources and move freely most of the day between the indoor and outdoor areas. Wall displays support children’s current interests and help parents’ understanding of their children’s learning. The outdoor areas encourage physical activity.</p><p>Teachers are developing effective ways of recording and sharing their planning and assessment of the learning programme. Their planning supports children to develop their dispositions and interests individually and as part of groups.</p><p>The centre is well lead by knowledgeable and experienced leaders and managers. They are improvement focused and provide strong support for teachers to develop their professional practice. There are good processes in place to manage the health and safety of children and adults. A new appraisal system is in the early stages of being introduced. This system encourages reflection on practice and is being adapted to meet new requirements.</p><p>All staff and parents are encouraged to contribute to reviewing aspects of the centre and to make suggestions for improvement. A strategic plan identifies goals for the year. The manager could now develop plans outlining the steps to be taken to achieve these strategic goals. Action plans could specify resources, personnel and timelines to complete tasks.</p><p>In order to sustain and clarify the work of the board, trustees could document the role of the board and how its work is to be conducted. Such guidelines would be useful when new trustees are inducted and could also provide a self-review tool against which the board could review its practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have identified appropriate development priorities that include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening planning, assessment and evaluation of the children’s learning programme</li>
<li>fully implementing the appraisal processes that have been adopted by the centre.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of St John's Progressive Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice the centre manager should strengthen the recording of procedures relating to personnel management so that effective systems are sustained. The board of trustees should ensure that the induction of new trustees is well supported by a guiding governance document.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of St John's Progressive Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>9 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h4>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h4><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
