</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Key Playcentre provides three sessions each week for children up to school age.  It is a small, rural centre located next to Mararoa School in The Key, Te Anau.</p><p>The sessions are led by an experienced, paid educator with the help of members. Playcentre parents are gaining Playcentre qualifications by being involved in the adult-education training programme provided by the Southland Playcentres Association (SPA).</p><p>The SPA is experiencing a time of change as all playcentre associations throughout New Zealand merge with the New Zealand Playcentre Federation (NZPF) to reduce duplication and make cost savings. This restructure will mean significant changes at the local association level. An interim board has been established at SPA to support playcentres through this transitional period.</p><p>The September 2013 ERO report identified a number of areas that required strengthening and the centre was asked to produce an action plan to guide improvements. The impact of this plan has not been monitored.  Some progress has been made in addressing the key next steps and issues related to compliance from the 2013 report. These continue to require further development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 13 in the Southland Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in a play-based programme. Members work alongside their own and other children following their interests, encouraging problem solving and exploration of the environment. The Playcentre draws on and uses the local community to enhance the curriculum provided.</p><p>An inviting area is made available for parents to settle and nurture infants. Individual preferences are respected and members are responsive to infants' individual needs.</p><p>Rich, oral language is used by members when they engage in conversations with children. Language development is supported through the use of descriptive language and conversations extended through the introduction of new words. Independence skills are promoted and children's sense of belonging is evident.</p><p>A key next step is for members to develop their understanding and knowledge of implementing a bicultural curriculum. Once established this should also support members' understanding of promoting educational success for Māori children.</p><p>Children's interests are recognised and are used to inform the group programme process. This is an area that requires further development.  The educator and members should more clearly identify the focus area and range of strategies that they will use to extend children's learning. This more purposeful planning should support members in identifying children's learning and progress.</p><p>Profile narratives reflect children's participation in the programme, the diversity of the curriculum and progress in relation to their learning goals. A next step is for members to evaluate how effectively each child's learning goal has been met.</p><p>Members regularly reflect on their roles and responsibilities. An ongoing process of regular review and internal evaluation to maintain and improve the quality of education and care is not evident. This requires urgent attention.</p><p>The board has been proactive in developing processes to assist in the smooth transition for playcentres to work under the NZPF. Opportunities have been offered to playcentre members to engage with the SPA to consider how the board could best provide support to services through the impending restructure.</p><p>The board has identified a number of systems and processes have lapsed and need improvement. Immediate attention is required to review policies that guide the appointments procedure and health and safety practices. The appraisal process has also lapsed or not been robustly implemented. These improvements are a priority to meet licensing criteria, and for monitoring the quality of centre practices.</p><p>More consistent, timely and evaluative reporting should be provided to the board to assure them that accountabilities are met and to better inform their decision making.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The playcentre educator and members agree areas for strengthening include:</p><ul>
<li>the bicultural curriculum</li>
<li>promoting educational success for Māori children</li>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><p>Key next steps for the association are to:</p><ul>
<li>review SPA policies, giving priority to those related to appointments and health and safety practices</li>
<li>re-establish the appraisal process</li>
<li>facilitate the evaluative reporting to the board.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Key Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to health and safety. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>a record of excursions that is signed by the person responsible and includes appropriate assessment and management of risk</li>
<li>a procedure for monitoring children's sleep which is displayed and implemented including keeping a record of children's sleep times. <br> <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS17, HS9]</em></li>
</ul><p>ERO also identified areas of non-compliance for the Southland Playcentre Association in relation to governance and management. To meet requirements the association needs to:</p><ul>
<li>implement a system of regular appraisal.<br> <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7]</em> </li>
</ul><p>To improve practice the Southland Playcentre Association should:</p><ul>
<li>ensure policies and procedures for travel by a motor vehicle clearly specify the person responsible for excursion approvals has verified all drivers have a current full New Zealand driver licence and each vehicle is registered and has a current warrant of fitness.</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Key Playcentre will be within two years. </p><p>Patricia Davey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>18 May 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
