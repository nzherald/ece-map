</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kowhai Kids Educare is located in a residential area of Warkworth. The centre provides full day care and education and caters for babies and children up to five years of age. Children are accommodated in two buildings and teachers plan for three broad age groups. Children up to two years of age enjoy purpose built facilities, and the two to five year olds are located in an adjacent building on the same site. Both areas provide children with easy access to large outdoor areas.</p><p>In 2014 the centre changed ownership. It is now part of the Evolve organisation that provides the centre with administrative and professional support. A centre manager supervises and takes responsibility for the day to day centre operations and team leaders have responsibility for care routines and the programme provided in the different rooms.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is based on four main principles: respect, partnership, whānau and biculturalism. These principles are evident through the centre and underpin the centre’s values.</p><p>The centre has responded positively to areas for improvement identified in the 2013 ERO report. There are plans for further work in the areas requiring ongoing development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children respond positively to the warm welcomes they receive from teachers and one another on arrival. They play well with their peers and in mixed age groups. Tuakana/teina relationships are evident among the younger and older children as they learn from and support each other. This contributes positively to children’s play and their social development. Children make free choices about their play activities and have ready access to a range of learning resources. They organise themselves to play, supported by teachers.</p><p>Providing more challenging play opportunities with greater complexity is necessary for the four to five year old children. Teachers acknowledge, and ERO agrees, that this is necessary to grow the physical and cognitive abilities of these older children.</p><p>There is good provision for infants and toddlers up to two years of age. They receive good nurturing and care. Adults interact with them respectfully and regard infants as active participants in verbal conversations.</p><p>Teachers develop and plan a curriculum based on their knowledge of children’s interests and strengths. Curriculum planning is offering learning opportunities for children across all of the learning areas. Programme evaluation continues to be strengthened by teachers focusing on individual children, and using children's next learning steps to inform the planning cycle.</p><p>Children can see themselves and their learning in the centre environment. Wall displays reflect children’s voice and include photographs of learning in action. Parents and whānau have access to these displays and can contribute ideas and reflections for the programme.</p><p>Biculturalism is visible through the centre and is an area that teachers continue to develop. Pacific cultures are also visible, in particular the Kiribati culture. This reflects the children and families from this region.</p><p>Teachers know children and families well. This is evident in the close relationships that the centre has with its families. Children with additional needs are catered for well and can participate fully in the programme.</p><p>Self review is used by teachers to reflect on their practice, and on teaching and learning programmes. Centre leaders agree that teachers would benefit from professional development aimed at deepening their reflective processes so that they are more evaluative. Strategic and annual planning would be more likely to help move the centre forward if leaders and teachers made increased use of the findings and outcomes from centre self-review.</p><p>Centre leaders have identified that for the centre to progress, professional development about leadership will need to be a key focus. ERO endorses the centre manager’s intention to seek external professional development in the areas of leadership, coaching and appraisal. Developing professional expectations for teachers that are aligned with the centre philosophy would also help the centre manager to lead her team.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that to support ongoing improvement in the centre a high priority should be given to professional learning and development that:</p><ul>
<li>strengthens centre leadership</li>
<li>provides strategies for teachers to interact with older children in ways that increase the challenge and complexity of play</li>
<li>further develops the effectiveness of self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kowhai Kids Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kowhai Kids Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>5 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
