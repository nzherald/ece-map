</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rainbows Gordonton is a Christian-based centre located in the rural settlement of Gordonton, close to Hamilton. It is sited on the campus of Eastwest College of Intercultural Studies. The service provides a sessional and all-day service of education and care for a maximum of 50 children at any one time, including up to 10 children under the age of two years. At the time of this ERO review, 57 children were enrolled, of whom 10 are identified as Māori.</p><p>The centre is managed by a charitable trust associated with the Eastwest College. A contact person acts on behalf of the trust, overseeing the centre’s licensing obligations and providing ongoing support to leaders and teachers. The supervisor and two team leaders are responsible for the teaching and learning in two age-group areas, one for babies and one for children aged over two years. At times toddlers follow routines, modified for their needs, within the over two area. The centre’s philosophy is based on Christian values, which are modelled in the curriculum.</p><p>Since the last ERO review the centre has made extensive changes to the curriculum and the environment. Self-review processes have been further developed and used to evaluate and enhance the learning opportunities for children. Teachers have recognised the value of working more collaboratively and sharing their knowledge and skills to enhance the responsiveness of their teaching.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are developing as confident, competent learners in a culture of respect and inclusion. They play happily alongside others, displaying good social skills, and form friendships with their peers. Children play outdoors actively, growing their physical skills and coordination. The attractive, well-presented environment encourages children to explore their interests. These may develop into long-term group projects that are supported by teachers, who provide appropriate resources and help children to research ideas.</p><p>Children’s cultural heritage and identity is supported. Te reo and tikanga Māori are included through displays, books and waiata. The inclusion of te reo in the programme is developing. Other languages, including children’s home languages, may be included. There is a strong emphasis on sign language.</p><p>Children up to two years old experience a calm settled atmosphere where they have time to investigate the environment and become familiar with the learning opportunities provided. The service maintains a high adult-to-child ratio, enabling teachers to establish secure and consistent relationships with babies and toddlers, and with their parents/whānau. Teachers are nurturing and responsive to children’s needs and respect home routines.</p><p>Teachers work as a strongly collaborative team. They share Christian values, support one another, and place priority on meeting the needs of children and their families. Teachers know children and their families well, and form close relationships with parents, whānau and children. They create a safe, secure and family-like culture that fully includes children with additional learning and support needs.</p><p>Teachers plan the programme to follow children’s interests and build on their knowledge and understanding. Literacy and numeracy are integrated as a natural part of the programme, providing children with many opportunities to hold extended conversations, engage in expressive arts, enjoy reading books and develop their ideas about mathematics. The centre has a close, reciprocal relationship with a nearby school, and supports children and parents to make positive transitions to the new setting. Parents appreciate their children’s e-portfolios, which inform them about their children’s activities and learning. They are able to share the stories and photographs with their children and extended family. Parents respond promptly to teachers, informing them about the links they recognise between home and centre learning.</p><p>Centre leaders cooperate to provide professional direction for the service, and maintain a climate of respect, teamwork, and shared values. They welcome parents and encourage them to participate in trips and events. Leaders have developed a useful self-review process that seeks the views of teachers and parents, and is focused on continuing improvement to centre practices and the learning programme. This encourages teachers to reflect and explore up-to-date theory and practice.</p><p>Centre management share the vision and philosophy of the service with leaders, teachers and parents. They provide support for centre leaders and teachers, ensuring that the property is well-maintained and safe. The centre is well-resourced, and teachers are supported to develop their capability through ongoing professional development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders are considering how to further develop teachers’ partnership with parents. The expectation is that the programme for children is consistently influenced by the aspirations and expectations that parents and whānau have for their children. ERO agrees that this is an important goal for improving outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rainbows Gordonton Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rainbows Gordonton Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>18 September 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
