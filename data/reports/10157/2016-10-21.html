</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rising Stars Henderson Early Childhood Centre is privately owned and provides education and care for up to 84 children from three months to school age. The centre caters for different age groups in three separate rooms. Children and teachers reflect the multicultural community where the centre is located.</p><p>The centre is led by a recently appointed centre manager and employs 12 teachers and a cook. The centre manager works closely with the owner to lead and manage daily operations. She also collaborates with an external consultant to mentor and guide teachers' practice. Each room is led by a room leader who manages the programme and models professional practice for her team.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy is underpinned by the belief that early childhood education lays the foundation for future learning and development. Teachers provide stimulating environments that support children’s holistic learning. The programme and strategies are guided by the principles of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report acknowledged respectful and caring relationships and improvements that had been made to the quality of the programme. ERO also highlighted the centre's commitment to biculturalism and high expectations for children's behaviour. Several areas were identified for further improvement, including appraisal systems, self-review processes and the quality of planning, evaluation and assessment. The manager and room leaders have worked collaboratively with an external consultant to improve these areas and they have made good progress.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy is evident throughout the programme and environment. The programme promotes children's sense of belonging, wellbeing and cultural identity. Children are encouraged to develop self-help skills. Tuakana/teina relationships are evident and children engage in lively conversation with each other and with adults.</p><p>Infants and toddlers receive nurturing individualised care, and are capable and confident to explore their environment. They make choices about their play and initiate activities. Respectful teaching practices and sensitively timed interactions help children to settle, engage in conversations and share their ideas. Teachers have focused on incorporating more natural materials to invite children's exploration.</p><p>Particular support is given to children and whānau who are new to the centre. Children are supported to settle in well. New parents are cared for and welcomed. Parents and whānau acknowledge the value that staff place on whanaungatanga. Many have expressed their appreciation of how their aspirations and opinions are valued and responded to by teachers.</p><p>Leaders model language well and engage children in conversations that support them to make good choices. Older children are confident to lead their learning. They are curious, show interest in the various activities and make choices about their play and learning.</p><p>Teachers have significantly improved the quality of planning for children's interests. This is evident in the way that teachers plan deliberately to meet the specific needs of the children in their care. They evaluate the usefulness of programme planning to make learning meaningful for children.</p><p>Teachers work well together and appreciate the many professional learning opportunities available. Managers mentor and support teachers effectively. This helps teachers to take on responsibilities in the centre and to monitor progress with their individual goals for building professional practice. Teachers are enthusiastic about the new planning assessment and evaluation systems. There are formal and informal opportunities for parents to learn about how they can support their children's learning at home and prepare them for transitioning to school.</p><p>Leaders have identified the need to improve bicultural practice and responsiveness to children's cultural identity and diverse backgrounds. Some teachers confidently integrate te reo Māori using basic commands, greetings, songs and stories. They could now incorporate te reo and te ao Māori in the programme to deepen the bicultural practices at the centre. Future professional development could support this development.</p><p>A newly developed staff performance management system strengthens teachers' ongoing professional learning. An external consultant has provided support to identify development goals from teachers' appraisals. Leaders have incorporated the cultural competencies of the Ministry of Education's <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners,</em> to support teachers' development of culturally responsive practice.</p><p>Leaders have developed a robust internal evaluation process that challenges thinking and results in improvement. Good practice indicators are used well to support improvement and achieve better outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre's owner and manager have worked collaboratively to develop strategic directions for the centre. Plans incorporate the principles of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and some indicators of good practice documented in <em>He Pou Tātaki</em>. A consultative and inclusive process has been used to design and monitor strategic and annual plans.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To support ongoing development, leaders and teachers could continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>refine and embed planning, assessment and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop the learning environment to promote children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embed the appraisal system and internal evaluation process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extend bicultural practices to promote the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rising Stars Henderson Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rising Stars Henderson Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>21 October 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
