<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Pio Pio Playcentre is well placed to continue promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Piopio Playcentre is a parent-led centre that is part of the King Country Playcentre Association. The playcentre&rsquo;s philosophy is based on &lsquo;active involvement of parents/caregivers/wh&#257;nau&rsquo; with parents being first educators and learning alongside their children. Pio Pio Playcentre attracts families from geographically remote areas and has traditional close links with the Aria Playcentre.</p><p>Since the 20109 ERO review there has been a considerable change in membership with many families new to the playcentre. Parents run one morning session from 9.30 to noon on Mondays. There is also a &lsquo;Big Kids&rsquo; session on Friday mornings supported by an experienced supervisor.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in ten early childhood education services within the King Country Playcentre Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation and the King Country Playcentre Association provide effective governance and management for this centre. The association provides comprehensive policy guidelines and an experienced centre support staff member who assists families to run the service.</p><p>Children experience a high-quality learning environment that encourages active exploration and imaginative and creative play. They benefit from positive, trusting and affirming relationships with other adults and children. Parents foster each child&rsquo;s social development and communication skills. Strong friendships are developed amongst the children.</p><p>Parents actively encourage children to take responsibility for themselves and others. Babies are well catered for with relevant resources and actively participate in playcentre programmes. Rich programme experiences, include the integration of literacy and mathematical concepts, and enable children to initiate and sustain play. The use of local community resources, including visits to the primary school and kohanga reo, provide additional, meaningful experiences for children. Parents skilled in te reo M&#257;ori are leading an increasing bicultural perspective in the centre.</p><p>A group of committed parents effectively lead and manage the playcentre. They have a strong collaborative approach that ensures each parent&rsquo;s particular strengths are encouraged, valued and used. New families are made to feel welcome and are encouraged to participate in training programmes available through the association. There is a focused approach to growing leadership to ensure the continued viability of the centre.</p><p>Parents value the strong supportive networks they develop with each other and acknowledge the importance they place on including families new to the community. Self-review processes are well established and focused on ongoing improvement. Through these processes members have identified the need to continue focusing on encouraging parents to undertake training and enhance their capacity in assessment, planning and evaluation. ERO agrees that this is an important ongoing priority given the regular change in playcentre membership.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pio Pio Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>11 January 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
