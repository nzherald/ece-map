</table><p>With the ongoing support of its proprietors, Rudolf Steiner Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Rudolf Steiner Kindergarten is located on the Rudolf Steiner School site at Maia on the west harbour of Dunedin. The kindergarten is part of a continuing journey where children start from age three and move to the Steiner school in their sixth year. Up to 35 children attend the daily sessions. Children play and learn in two mixed-age groups in the Kowhai and Rata Rooms.</p><p>Before starting kindergarten younger children may attend a playgroup held on Friday mornings in one of the classrooms. Many families travel significant distances to attend the kindergarten and playgroup because of its special character.</p><p>Since the ERO review in 2012, the teachers have had more training in the Steiner method. They now have a better shared understanding of Steiner philosophy and this is more evident in practice. Other improvements include systems in place to plan for, and monitor the progress of, each child.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play and learn in calm, homely, indoor and outdoor areas with open-ended natural resources that encourage children to use their imagination. The spacious outdoor area provides a variety of places for children to explore the natural surroundings.</p><p>Children and their families benefit from very caring and supportive relationships with their teachers. ERO observed a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing. A strength of the kindergarten is the many opportunities provided for parents to be involved in their child’s learning. For example a weekly singing group, monthly whānau meetings, and home visits by teachers.</p><p>Children develop a sense of order in routines that are structured around the rhythms of the day, the week and the cycles of the seasons during the year. The early childhood curriculum, Te Whāriki, is effectively integrated into the Steiner approach</p><p>Children have frequent and interesting opportunities for:</p><ul>
<li>cooking, gardening, caring for animals</li>
<li>listening to stories and the development of oral language skills</li>
<li>music and movement</li>
<li>creative and expressive play.</li>
</ul><p>Māori perspectives are very evident in the daily programme and in the kindergarten values. This is shown by:</p><ul>
<li>the way the teachers view the whole child</li>
<li>the integration of myths and legends</li>
<li>celebrating events such as Mātariki</li>
<li>regular inclusion of waiata, te reo Māori and tikanga Māori.</li>
</ul><p>Records of the weekly playgroup show comprehensive planning and detailed learning information kept for the children who attend with their parents. </p><p>ERO acknowledges the commitment of the playgroup leader to ensuring a high quality programme. However, this has created an unsustainable workload. It is timely for her to work with the head teacher to review the amount of documentation she is keeping about children’s learning.</p><p>Records of group planning and assessment in the Rata room need to improve. ERO found little written group planning and evaluations. These teachers need to work with the head teacher in the Kowhai room to develop their planning and assessment practices and processes.</p><p>Since the last review the rooms have been rearranged to make two mixed-age classrooms. It is time for the teachers to review how well this arrangement is working for all children, in particular the needs of older children.</p><p>In December 2013 ‘structure’ meetings were held to clarify the vision and roles of the groups within the Steiner school and kindergarten. There is now a clearer direction and the proprietors are taking a more active role in the governance of the kindergarten. A useful and relevant strategic plan has been developed. An annual plan is in place to guide teachers in their work.</p><p>In 2013 a comprehensive appraisal process for the head teacher and teachers’ was developed, started but not completed. The proprietors must urgently address this. </p><p>The dedicated head teacher has a good knowledge and understanding of her role and responsibilities and has sought external support for professional development. She effectively manages the day-to-day running of the kindergarten. She has high expectations of herself and her teachers.</p><p>Next Steps In their role as governors, the proprietors need to give the kindergarten more prominence.</p><p>This includes:</p><ul>
<li>greater support for the head teacher in her role</li>
<li>closely monitoring the progress of the strategic plan and annual plan</li>
<li>ensuring kindergarten policies and procedures are relevant and regularly reviewed.</li>
</ul><p>The provisionally-registered teachers need to restart their advice and guidance programme and keep meaningful documentation to show evidence of their progress towards meeting the registered teacher criteria. The proprietors should ensure that this process is maintained and expect that full registration will be achieved within an agreed timeframe. </p><p>The head teacher and teaching team agree that self-review practices are in the early stages of development. The next step is for them to build the knowledge, use and understanding of effective self review. The outcomes of self review need be reported to the governors to assure them how well children’s learning is being supported.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Dunedin Rudolf Steiner Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Dunedin Rudolf Steiner Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>2 September 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
