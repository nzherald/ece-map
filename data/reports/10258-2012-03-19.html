<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Y-Under Fives Education is situated in a West Auckland leisure complex that is administered by the YMCA. A strong feature of the centre is the very good relationships between teachers and children. Parents are made to feel welcome in the centre and are well informed about their children&rsquo;s education and care. Teachers communicate well with each other about how they can best support children&rsquo;s emerging interests.</p><p>Teachers support children as capable and independent learners. Children are confident as a result of the warm, inclusive interactions they have with their teachers and with other children. The flexible programme allows children to determine how and where they play. They engage well with their play and are accomplished at communicating their ideas and feelings. Younger children, in particular, choose from a variety of activities that extend their thinking.</p><p>Staff have addressed most of the recommendations from the 2009 ERO report. They have been supported by the centre supervisor to cater better for children&rsquo;s emerging interests and strengths. The recently appointed early childhood education manager has prioritised her support of staff implementing improved centre systems including self review and teacher appraisal.</p><p>Staff have ensured that health and safety matters identified in the 2009 ERO report have been addressed. YMCA managers are in the process of appointing a new supervisor and are aware of the importance of continuing the momentum of centre development that is focused on progressing all children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Y-Under Fives Education was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atY-Under Fives Education.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Staff have used the findings of the 2009 ERO to review centre practices, especially the learning programme. Several professional development initiatives have supported teachers to improve their planning and assessment.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><em>Interactions. </em><span>Children&rsquo;s positive interactions with other children and teachers benefit their learning. The settled centre environment provides opportunities for children to involve themselves in purposeful play. Collaborative interactions between children result in extended periods of play. Children confidently seek help from adults. Supportive</span> tuakana/teina relationships provide opportunities for babies and toddlers to observe, and learn alongside older children.</p><p><em>Family involvement.</em> Teachers maintain good relationships with parents. In response to survey information, parents are now better informed about centre routines at the time their child&rsquo;s enrolment. This initiative is one of several that have focused on improving parent/centre relationships. Staff have also focused on ways to better communicate centre goals to parents.</p><p>Parents discuss their child&rsquo;s progress with a &lsquo;key teacher&rsquo; who has an in depth knowledge of their assigned group of children. Teachers show a sincere interest in children&rsquo;s lives outside the centre. <span>They use their very good knowledge of children and their families to foster and support the physical, social and emotional wellbeing of each child.</span></p><p><em>Communication.</em> <span>Teachers support children to develop language skills by listening attentively and responding well.</span> They use open-ended questions to extend children&rsquo;s thinking. As a result of this good quality support, children often initiate conversations and share their interests with teachers.</p><p><em>Programme planning and assessment.</em> Teachers use a useful framework for programme planning that considers the different influences on children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers acknowledge that they could evaluate in more depth how they respond to what they notice and recognise in children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p><em>Learning environment.</em> Children access resources easily. Younger children settle well to self-chosen activities and areas of play. Significant features of the learning environment that support children&rsquo;s learning include:</p><ul>
<li>a well resourced and positioned family play area that successfully promotes sustained imaginative play</li>
<li>M&#257;ori artifacts and language that are displayed and shared with children</li>
<li>multicultural displays that parents and children have contributed towards</li>
<li>stories being read to children in a variety of settings and teachers asking questions to deepen children&rsquo;s understanding about the contents of books.</li>
</ul><p><em>Improved centre operations.</em> YMCA policies and procedures continue to support centre operations. The role of &lsquo;early childhood education manager&rsquo; has been created to ensure consistency of good practice within and across the YMCA&rsquo;s learning centres.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p><em>Support for older children&rsquo;s learning.</em> Teachers could better support four year old children&rsquo;s learning. They should review ways to engage older children in sustained play. Such review would help teachers understand how the good teaching practice evident with younger children could apply to four year olds. In particular, teachers should better respond to the emerging interests of this group of children by developing areas of play to extend their thinking.</p><p><em>Literacy and mathematics. </em><span>Teachers should provide more opportunities for children to develop their literacy and mathematical skills, including:</span></p><ul>
<li>learning experiences that allow children to explore different purposes for writing</li>
<li>non-fiction books with topics that link to and extend children&rsquo;s interests</li>
<li>mathematical understandings in the context of the programme.</li>
</ul><p><em>Portfolios.</em> Staff could use children&rsquo;s assessment portfolios to communicate the learning that has occured. Parents would be better able to gauge their children&rsquo;s progress, be better informed about what teachers plan to do to extend their children&rsquo;s learning and to contribute to programme planning.</p><p><em>Self-review processes.</em> Teachers could use the centre&rsquo;s self-review process to improve some aspects of centre practice. Areas that have been identified for development and review include improved centre record keeping systems and regular staff appraisals.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Y-Under Fives Education completed an ERO Centre ManagementAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendations</h2><p>ERO and the centre managers agree that:</p><p>4.1. teachers should explore strategies to improve programmes for older children.</p><p>4.2. the centre supervisor and teachers continue to use self review in order to enhance teaching practices and centre operations.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-y-under-fives-education" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Y-Under Fives Education</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Y-Under Fives Education.</p><p>Y-Under Fives Education is situated in a West Auckland leisure complex that is administered by the YMCA. A strong feature of the centre is the very good relationships between teachers and children. Parents are made to feel welcome in the centre and are well informed about their children&rsquo;s education and care. Teachers communicate well with each other about how they can best support children&rsquo;s emerging interests.</p><p>Teachers support children as capable and independent learners. Children are confident as a result of the warm, inclusive interactions they have with their teachers and with other children. The flexible programme allows children to determine how and where they play. They engage well with their play and are accomplished at communicating their ideas and feelings. Younger children, in particular, choose from a variety of activities that extend their thinking.</p><p>Staff have addressed most of the recommendations from the 2009 ERO report. They have been supported by the centre supervisor to cater better for children&rsquo;s emerging interests and strengths. The recently appointed early childhood education manager has prioritised her support of staff implementing improved centre systems including self review and teacher appraisal.</p><p>Staff have ensured that health and safety matters identified in the 2009 ERO report have been addressed. YMCA managers are in the process of appointing a new supervisor and are aware of the importance of continuing the momentum of centre development that is focused on progressing all children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information About Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
