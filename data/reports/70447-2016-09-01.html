</table><p>ABC Salisbury are Well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Salisbury Street operates under the BestStart Educare Ltd management structure. BestStart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large national organisation that owns early childhood education centres across New Zealand.</p><p>The centre is situated in the heart of Christchurch city. The increasingly diverse community is well represented in the families and staff at the centre. The centre has a nursery to cater for infants and toddlers and a preschool for older children.</p><p class="TableParagraph">Since the 2013 ERO review, there have been significant changes to management and leadership. There have been a number of new staff appointed due to the increasing roll. Most staff are qualified and registered teachers. An on-site cook provides meals and snacks to meet children's dietary needs.</p><p>Centre leaders have successfully implemented a systematic and planned approach to addressing the recommendations from the previous review. They have placed increased importance on bicultural perspectives in centre documentation and practices. Teachers are clearly focused on making sure their shared philosophy is reflected in practice.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders and teachers actively promote positive, respectful relationships with children and families. Children play well with and alongside others. Older children are encouraged to take responsibility for the environment, and to care for younger children.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are very sensitive and responsive to cultural diversity and the individual needs and preferences of families. The skills of staff are appropriately used to support families in a number of home languages.</p><p>Children with additional needs are carefully supported in the inclusive learning environment. Individualised, flexible transitions into and within the centre help children to settle well.</p><p>Children are actively involved in a wide range of interesting and enjoyable learning experiences including exploratory, creative and physical activities. Teachers give careful consideration to the thoughtful presentation of the spacious, well organised learning areas. They create inviting spaces for children to explore and make their own discoveries. Purposeful links with the community and visitors to the centre enhance the learning programme offered to children.</p><p>The specific needs of infants and toddlers in the nursery are caringly met by responsive staff. Predictable, unhurried routines provide children with a calm environment that promotes their wellbeing.</p><p>Parents and families are well informed of children’s interests and participation in the learning programme through informative wall displays, individual profile books and online learning stories. Teachers value parents' views and make good use of parent aspirations for their children when planning the learning programme.</p><p>The centre manager, business manager and professional services manager are knowledgeable and experienced. They work in partnership to increasingly align and implement BestStart systems effectively, including quality assurance, strategic planning, appraisal and health and safety processes.</p><p>Managers have clear expectations and specific strategies to manage change well and to build on teacher capability and leadership skills. Leaders and teachers regularly engage in systematic and collaborative internal evaluation that informs centre priorities and teaching and learning. Regular and targeted professional development and mentoring is provided to staff to help build reflective and evaluative practices. </p><p>There is a strong shared focus on continuous improvement and promoting positive outcomes for children and families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers have identified, and ERO's evaluation has confirmed, that key next steps are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>review and refine assessment, planning and evaluation processes </li>
<li>increase bicultural perspectives and practices across all aspects of centre operations</li>
<li>strengthen teachers' understanding and confidence to lead indepth planned internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Salisbury Street completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Salisbury Street will be in three years. </p><p>Lesley Patterson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>1 September 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
