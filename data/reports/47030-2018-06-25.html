</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Launch Active Early Learning is a locally owned and operated service in Hastings catering for children and families from across the Hawkes Bay. The centre is licensed for 82 children aged from birth to six years, including 24 up to two years. The current roll is 104, including 13 Māori children.</p><p>The centre is divided into four separate indoor learning spaces and two outdoor spaces designed specifically for different age groups. The centre philosophy is underpinned by positive relationships between teachers, families and children.</p><p>A centre manager oversees the day-to-day operation of the centre. Team leaders have responsibility for their designated areas.</p><p>This is its first ERO report since opening in 2016.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy statement is appropriately underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers have begun to explore what this looks like for children in relation to the different age groups.</p><p>Positive interactions between teachers and children contribute to a settled learning environment. Children are active and engaged. Teachers' respectful and collaborative practices result in a calm, nurturing atmosphere where children, parents and families feel welcome.</p><p>Children are supported to lead their own learning and confidently engage in the programme. A range of learning experiences and resources are provided by teachers, who work alongside children to promote their independence, exploration and social competencies. Children are supported to be self-managing, to take risks and to problem solve.</p><p>Regular excursions into the community and planned centre events provide an added dimension to the curriculum. This includes trips to a forest farm for the oldest children with a focus on sustainability and the environment. It is timely for leaders and teachers to inquire into and evaluate how effectively this activity supports children's learning and competencies.</p><p>Responsive caregiving supports infants' and toddlers' needs for secure and strong attachments and enables teachers to respond to each child's needs. Exploration and play is unhurried. Teachers support individuals to investigate their surroundings and purposefully engage in play. The environment is organised well to meet the needs of these learners.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning should be strengthened to better reflect children's learning outcomes. Teachers use an online assessment tool to document children's participation and engagement in the programme. Parents and whānau are able to contribute to these. Curriculum guidelines that align to the centre's philosophy and intended outcomes for children should document expectations of what effective assessment looks like, including:</p><ul>
<li>planning and intentional teaching for individuals</li>
<li>how learning is progressed over time</li>
<li>connections to children's culture, language and identity</li>
<li>responsiveness to parent aspirations and perspectives.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers use te reo Māori and integrate aspects of tikanga Māori into the programme. The bicultural programme should continue to be enhanced and strengthened.</p><p>Leaders and teachers recognise the importance of strong relationships for the development of successful learning partnerships with Māori families to promote Māori children's success. Teachers identify that developing learning partnerships with Pacific families is a priority. ERO's evaluation confirms this.</p><p>Children's transitions into, within rooms and on to school are carefully considered and personalised for each child and family. Children move freely across all rooms supporting their transition readiness.</p><p>Teachers work in collaboration with parents and external agencies to help children who require additional learning support progress towards their individual goals.</p><p>Leadership is focused on providing a service that is responsive to children's needs and promotes collaborative ways of working. There is a clear commitment to developing staff knowledge and skills through ongoing professional learning. The current appraisal system is under review. Leaders now need to develop a clear policy and procedures to guide the process. This should include how teachers are supported to inquire into their practice to improve outcomes for children.</p><p>Leaders have developed and implemented some systems and processes to support centre operation and teaching and learning. ERO identified that further development is needed in: documenting practices to support teaching and learning; further developing the strategic plan and determining actions to progress centre priorities in annual planning; and strengthening internal evaluation. These should better enable the service to evaluate the impact of systems, processes and practices on outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that key next steps are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation that responds to children's needs and interests and promotes complexity of learning over time</li>
<li>culturally responsive practices to better respond to Māori and Pacific learners</li>
<li>the appraisal process to align with current legislative requirements.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO identified that the centre should:</p><ul>
<li>document practices to support teaching and learning</li>
<li>further develop the strategic plan and determine actions to progress annual planning priorities</li>
<li>strengthen internal evaluation processes and practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Launch Active Early Learning completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve performance the service provider should ensure that the child protection policy is referenced to the <em>Vulnerable Children Act 2014.</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Launch Active Early Learning will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>25 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
