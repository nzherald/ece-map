</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>PORSE Napier S1 is a home-based education and care network operating under the umbrella of PORSE In-Home Childcare. Qualified and registered Programme Tutors work alongside Educators to implement and support learning programmes for children in homes. PORSE also supports families and educators with professional development, administration and payroll services. A national team provides governance and management support for all PORSE services.</p><p>PORSE offers two models of education and care: the Home Educator model, where an educator works in their own home; and a Nanny Educator model, where an educator works in a family’s home. PORSE provides a range of training programmes and workshops for home educators, nannies and parents. Of the 104 children enrolled in the network at the time of this ERO review, 11 identify as Māori. </p><p>The PORSE vision is ‘expanding the hearts, minds and wellbeing of a nation through nurturing childcare in-home’.</p><p>This review is one of a cluster of seven home-based network reviews of PORSE In-Home Childcare.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in a learning programme that is appropriately based on their interests. Educators follow these interests and respond by providing a range of activities. PORSE promotes their play school experience as part of the child’s overall learning programme. There are opportunities for children to participate in these play schools and other social events.</p><p>There are regular opportunities for ongoing learning through professional development initiatives facilitated by PORSE. Educators and families are kept well informed of these.</p><p>Educators are aware of children’s individual needs and respond appropriately. They provide regular useful information for parents about their child’s day.</p><p>Educators and programme tutors share a positive working relationship. During regular monthly home visits, programme tutors monitor the health and safety of the environment to promote the safety of children. They discuss the children’s interests and development with the educator. They observe children and focus on supporting the educator’s awareness of children’s developmental milestones.</p><p>Greater emphasis by programme tutors on supporting educators to develop an understanding of assessment, planning and evaluation of children’s learning is a priority. Discussion during home visits provides some direction for educators in supporting children’s interests. However, the quality of programme tutors’ documentation of how they support and coach educators to use assessment could be strengthened.</p><p>PORSE managers recognise that deepening their understanding of the self-review process is a next step. Use of a more evaluative and systematic approach to review, that focuses on outcomes for children, should strengthen current practice.</p><p>Leaders acknowledge that the appraisal process needs further development. ERO agrees with this direction and identifies that strengthening the feedback focus on teaching and learning should improve outcomes for educators and children.</p><p>There is a commitment to strengthening the bicultural approach within a home-based context. PORSE is developing plans to strengthen the participation of Māori families in the organisation. These plans should also include strategies for promoting success for Māori as Māori.</p><p>Managers are improvement-focused and have some useful systems and processes established to track operational expectations. The streamlining and monitoring of the implementation of these systems and practices, including those relating to health and safety, require further strengthening.</p><p>PORSE administration systems effectively support educators, programme tutors and coaches in their roles. Strengthening guiding documents and associated practices relating to the considered use of information and communication technologies and social media in an educational context is a next step.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities for this service are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation for children’s learning</li>
<li>the bicultural approach within a home-based context including the focus on success for Māori as Māori</li>
<li>self review as a tool to improve outcomes for children</li>
<li>the appraisal process by strengthening the robustness of feedback</li>
<li>streamlining and monitoring of systems and practices, including those relating to health and safety.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of PORSE Napier S1 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice the service should ensure that the curriculum is informed by assessment, planning and evaluation (documented and undocumented) that demonstrates an understanding of children’s learning, their interests, whānau and life contexts.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of PORSE Napier S1 will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central Select Region</p><p>24 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
