</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Riverdale Kindergarten (Gisborne) is adjacent to Riverdale School. It opens from 8:30am to 2:30pm Monday to Thursday and 8.30am to 12.45pm on Friday. The service is licensed for up to 40 children aged from two to school age. Of the 43 children currently enrolled, 36 identify as Māori.</p><p>The centre philosophy has an overarching mission statement 'Kei te rere te wairua o te tamaiti, me te ora o te Māori', 'the uniqueness of the child flies within their spirit'. Five key learning areas reflect the strands of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and show a connection to the key competencies of <em>The</em> <em>New Zealand Curriculum.</em></p><p>The outdoor learning space has undergone some significant redevelopment since the September 2014 ERO evaluation.</p><p>A head teacher oversees day-to-day operation of the centre. All teachers are fully qualified. Staff have participated in professional development provided by the Gisborne Kindergarten Association (the association) that has included learning about te ao Māori, working with younger children and assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>Riverdale Kindergarten is one of 11 kindergartens governed and managed by the Gisborne Kindergarten Association (the association). Two senior teachers provide ongoing professional support and guidance to individual kindergartens. A pouawhina has been appointed on a fixed term contract to guide kindergartens implementation of tikanga and kaupapa Māori practices.</p><p>The September 2014 ERO report identified a number of areas for review and development at kindergarten level, including; continuity and extension of learning; understanding of the philosophy; self review; the bicultural programme; success for Māori and Pacific children; assessment, planning and evaluation. Good progress has been made in all areas. At association level, it was identified that strategic self review needed further development. This is ongoing.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the Gisborne Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children confidently engage in a play-based curriculum. Teachers work closely alongside individuals and groups, supporting their learning. Interactions are respectful, responsive and fun. Children's growing independence and social competence are well supported. They have opportunities to challenge themselves and take risks.</p><p>The nature-based setting is a strength, with the learning environment thoughtfully resourced to invite children’s exploration and engagement.</p><p>Aspects of kaupapa Māori are valued and promoted in the centre. Tikanga practices are well understood by children. Techers use te reo Māori in meaningful conversations. Leaders and teachers continue to build their knowledge and understanding of te ao Māori, to assist in the development of a meaningful bicultural curriculum that reflects its local context. Specific professional learning and develop and annual noho marae visits are key strategies for enhancing their knowledge and understanding.</p><p>Strong reciprocal, responsive, and respectful learning partnerships are formed with whānau Māori and families. Teachers provide opportunities for families to contribute to their child’s learning as valued partners.</p><p>Planning for learning is focused on children’s needs and interests. Parents' aspirations are recorded soon after enrolment. Teachers and whānau work in partnership to develop specific learning goals aligned to the five key learning areas that underpin the valued outcomes of the centre’s philosophy. Children's learning journals record how they progress towards meeting their identified learning goals. Teachers should continue to strengthen these practices to better demonstrate high expectations for children as learners and their learning.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported. External agencies are accessed when required to support their progress.</p><p>Well-considered practices support children's transition into the centre and on to school. A useful range of strategies and information is used to support children and their parents during this time.</p><p>A collaborative leadership approach is evident. The teaching team work well together to respond to children and family's needs.</p><p>Teachers are well supported to grow their practice. There is a strong commitment to developing staff knowledge and skills through ongoing professional learning and the sharing of good practice. Senior teachers regularly identify actions and provoke thinking in relation to children's learning. The newly developed appraisal system, when fully implemented, should strengthen teacher inquiries into their own practice.</p><p>Association leaders have a well-considered approach to progressing strategic objectives. Connections to the community are strong and maintaining these continues to be a focus. Leaders are committed to Treaty-based partnerships and acknowledging Māori as tangata whenua. The association has identified that developing shared understanding of internal evaluation is a priority. ERO's evaluation confirms this.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review and develop a curriculum that reflects its local context and includes te ao Māori perspectives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen the quality of assessment and planning for children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>fully implement the revised appraisal system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop shared understanding and use of internal evaluation across all levels.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Riverdale Kindergarten (Gisborne) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Riverdale Kindergarten (Gisborne) will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>1 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
