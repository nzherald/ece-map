</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ormond Kindergarten is on the Ormond School grounds in Gisborne. It opens from 8:30am to 2:30pm Monday to Thursday and 8:30am to 12:45pm on Friday. The service is licensed for up to 34 children aged from two years to school age, and five children up to the age of two. Of the 52 children currently enrolled in the service none are aged up to two, and four identify as Māori.</p><p>The centre philosophy describes a commitment to provide a learning environment that responds to individual children and encourages positive relationships, meaningful communication, perseverance and active learning.</p><p>The current teaching team was fully established in November 2017. A head teacher oversees day-to-day operation of the centre. All teachers are fully qualified and are supported by a teacher aide. Over the past three years, staff have participated in professional development provided by the Gisborne Kindergarten Association (the association) that has included learning about te ao Māori, working with younger children and assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>Ormond is one of 11 kindergartens governed and managed by the association. Two senior teachers provide professional support and guidance to individual kindergartens. A pouawhina has been appointed on a fixed-term contract to guide kindergartens' implementation of tikanga and kaupapa Māori practices.</p><p>The September 2014 ERO report identified a number of areas for strengthening at the kindergarten level, including: assessment, planning and evaluation; the bicultural programme, and self review. Some progress has been made in relation to these. It was identified that the association should undertake strategic self review. Progress is ongoing.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the Gisborne Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The newly established philosophy is evident throughout the programme. Children engage in a playbased curriculum that is highly reflective of the local rural community. Teachers plan an environment that links to children's home life. Children are confident, capable and articulate.</p><p>Development of the bicultural curriculum is ongoing. Teachers are building their use of te reo Māori and understanding of te ao Māori through professional learning. They should continue to embed this knowledge into daily use.</p><p>Teachers effectively engage children in authentic learning experiences for sustained periods of time. They use a range of strategies to support children's growing social competence. Positive outcomes for children with additional learning needs are progressed in collaboration with external agencies. Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and an increasing understanding of how the world works.</p><p>Strategies that promote educational success for Māori are yet to be fully explored. A key next step is to deepen teachers' knowledge and understanding of how these can be meaningfully integrated within the context of this kindergarten.</p><p>Relationships with parents are strong. Parents have input into setting their children's learning goals and opportunities to participate in the programme. Teachers have identified that strengthening relationships towards learning-centred partnerships is an area for development. ERO's external evaluation confirms this.</p><p>Planning for children's learning clearly links their interests and strengths to the centre philosophy. Online portfolios document the cycle of goal setting and evaluation as well as children's participation in the programme. Further strengthening of assessment should support improved planning and evaluation. Teachers should consider how to better:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>identify children's learning and show their progress over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reflect individual's culture, language and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>document how intentional teaching impacts on learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Staff understanding of internal evaluation is in the early stages. Regular self review is undertaken in relation to environment and centre processes.</p><p>Teachers are well supported to develop their practice. There is a strong commitment to developing staff knowledge and skills through ongoing professional learning and the sharing of good practice. Senior teachers regularly identify actions and provoke thinking in relation to children's learning. The newly developed appraisal system, when fully implemented, should strengthen teacher inquiries into their own practice.</p><p>Association leaders have a well-considered approach to progressing strategic objectives. Connections to the community are strong and maintaining these continues to be a focus. Leaders are committed to Treaty-based partnerships and acknowledging Māori as tangata whenua. The association has identified that developing shared understanding of internal evaluation is a priority. ERO's evaluation confirms this.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>explore and implement strategies to promote educational success for Māori children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment of children's learning to better inform planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop learning centred partnerships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop the bicultural curriculum.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>fully implement the new appraisal system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop shared understanding and use of internal evaluation across all levels.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ormond Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ormond Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>7 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
