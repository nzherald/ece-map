</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Community Kindy Warspite Ave is situated in Waitangirua. It provides education and care for children from birth to five years of age five days a week. The service offers extended hours and flexible booking times to meet the diverse needs of its community.  At the time of this ERO review, 23 of the children enrolled identified as Māori and 37 as Pacific.</p><p>The service have been supported by the Ministry of Education (MoE) to strengthen teachers' professional practice. In September 2016, leaders developed a plan to address the key areas requiring improvement. These included the quality of teaching and learning and centre leadership. The MoE continues to monitor progress against this plan.</p><p>The service is currently in the process of recruiting a new centre manager. The area manager is temporarily managing the day-to-day operation of the centre and providing curriculum support for the teaching team until a new centre manager is appointed. All teachers are fully qualified and represent a diverse range of cultures. Staff are led by three head teachers.</p><p>Community Kindy Warspite Ave is owned and operated by BestStart Educare Ltd. BestStart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large national organisation that owns early childhood services across New Zealand.</p><p>This is the centre's first ERO evaluation since it commenced operation in March 2014.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in a play-based curriculum. Teachers follow their interests and promote their independence as learners. Literacy and mathematics are a focus throughout the programme. The service curriculum is in the early stages of development.</p><p>Responsive caregiving meets infants' and toddlers' needs for strong and secure relationships. Unhurried routines supports their learning. Children requiring additional learning support are identified, planned for and monitored by teachers. Where appropriate external agencies are used.</p><p>Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori is part of the centre's programme. Te ao Māori is promoted through a dedicated carved Te Waharoa (entrance way). This acknowledges and celebrates the local iwi, marae, waka, awa and moana of Porirua. Waiata Māori are popular activities.</p><p>Pacific cultures are celebrated at the centre. Teachers' knowledge and understanding of the community is used well to support their developing understanding of ways to acknowledge Pacific cultures in the programme.</p><p>Building strong relationships between whānau, parents and families is a centre focus. Engaging with whānau Māori and the Pacific community to determine what educational success looks like for them and their children is a next step. This should assist leaders and teachers to develop learning partnerships to achieve this outcome.</p><p>A new planning framework has recently been introduced. Teachers identify children's interests to develop specific learning goals, teaching strategies and activities to support their learning. Assessment, planning and evaluation are at an early stage of development.</p><p>Children's profiles record their participation in the programme, developing relationships and ongoing interests. This assessment information should be improved through:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>using parents' aspirations for their children to inform the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>specific links to children's learning goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly showing children's progress in learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children's cultures, languages and identities being acknowledged and celebrated.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Transitions into and through the centre are thoughtfully considered. Leaders have identified the need to develop a robust approach to implementing the BestStart school readiness initiative, including developing useful relationships with local schools. ERO agrees.</p><p>A clear framework guides the appraisal process. This includes self and appraiser assessment and has a developmental focus. Formal observations of practice are providing useful information about the quality of teaching. BestStart provides opportunities to participate in a wide range of professional learning and development.</p><p>The centre internal evaluation process is currently enabling teachers to look in greater depth at aspects of practice. It is not yet focused on evaluating how well practice improves outcomes for children.</p><p>The BestStart quality education and care action planning process successfully identifies areas for improvement. Ongoing monitoring, review and evaluation of the progress the centre is making to improve the quality of teaching remains a priority.</p><p>Leaders acknowledge that building teachers' capability to sustain ongoing improvement is an area for development. The appointment of permanent staff to the vacant leadership position is a key priority for the service.</p><p>Professional service managers provide regular feedback, support and guidance about the curriculum in action. This clearly identifies strengths and areas for development. Roles and responsibilities of leaders and managers are clearly identified and well understood. A comprehensive policy framework, including procedures and systems, guides the operation of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Service managers, through planning, monitoring, reporting, reviewing and internal evaluation processes should continue to focus on improving the quality of the curriculum and teaching and learning practices.</p><p>In addition, ERO and leaders agree the next steps are to continue to improve:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>knowledge and understanding of educational success for Māori and success for Pacific</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers' understanding and approaches to assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers' and leaders' capability in internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Community Kindy Warspite Ave completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Community Kindy Warspite Ave will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>15 February 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
