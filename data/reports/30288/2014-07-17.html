</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids to Five on Dey Street provides sessional and full-day education and care for children from birth to school age. There are three separate age-based areas. Infants and toddlers share an outdoor play space while older children have a separate area. The centre is located in Hamilton East and caters for children and families from diverse cultural backgrounds. It provides a full day service for 70 children, including up to 20 children under two years of age at any one time. At the time of this ERO review the roll of 79 included 30 children identified as Māori and children from many other cultural backgrounds. The teaching team has nine fully qualified teachers and one in training.</p><p>The centre continues to operate under the umbrella of Kidicorp Ltd. The Hamilton regional office of Kidicorp Ltd was established in 2012 and provides strong and effective governance, leadership and management support. This includes well-developed and rigorous self review and quality assurance processes, along with professional, administrative and business support by well qualified and experienced personnel. These are underpinned by clear vision and values.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review there have been changes to the leadership structure. Responsibilities for overall centre management are now shared by two experienced centre leaders. Several new teachers have joined the teaching team. Centre leaders and teachers have continued to build on the good practice in self review, relationships and the learning environment which were areas for improvement identified in the 2011 ERO report. Leaders have also substantially improved teachers’ learning conversations with children, strengthened parent partnerships, and increased the use of computer technologies to enhance children’s learning. There have also been recent improvements and upgrades to equipment and centre environments.</p><p>Kidicorp Ltd and this service are committed to providing equitable opportunities for local families and increasing their access to early childhood education. They provide a participation vehicle for transport and work in close partnership with the Ministry of Education.</p><p>The centre philosophy gives priority to:</p><ul>
<li>the importance of whānau and community involvement</li>
<li>maintaining an environment inclusive of kaupapa Māori</li>
<li>recognising and supporting the diverse range of children’s cultures</li>
<li>promoting children as leaders of their learning.</li>
</ul><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in an extensive curriculum that is founded on their identified interests. They are confident and capable learners who benefit from many opportunities to communicate their ideas and share creativity with their peers and caring and enthusiastic teachers. Priority is given to experiences that build children’s love and knowledge of literacy and number. The 'Be School Ready' approach enriches older children’s literacy and mathematical concepts and supports them to learn in meaningful ways. Children were observed by ERO to be:</p><ul>
<li>enjoying physical challenges using appropriate equipment</li>
<li>experimenting with a wide variety of high quality materials and equipment that encourage children to be creative and imaginative in their play</li>
<li>exploring the interesting and well-designed indoor and outdoor environments</li>
<li>pursuing their interests for sustained periods of time</li>
<li>confidently using computer technologies to extend their learning.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and the teaching team have established a collegial and professional culture that is focused on promoting high quality practice and positive outcomes for children. This is evident through:</p><ul>
<li>responsive and nurturing care for babies and very young children which contributes to their confidence and the settled atmosphere in the infants’ room</li>
<li>teachers’ respectful, affirming and inclusive relationships and interactions with children</li>
<li>teachers modelling the skills and language that promotes children’s growing social competence</li>
<li>intentional teaching responses that support children to engage in sustained and cooperative play</li>
<li>thoughtfully planned learning environments linked to centre-wide gaols.</li>
</ul><p>Agreed priorities for centre development are for teachers to</p><ul>
<li>continue to build their understanding about, and further integrate bicultural and multicultural practices, in programme, planning and assessment practices</li>
<li>more consistently integrate literacy and number across all learning areas</li>
<li>increase their responsiveness to children’s ideas and working theories of the world.</li>
</ul><p>Parents are well informed about their children’s learning and development. Recent initiatives such as e-portfolios have led to more in-depth sharing by some families and teachers about children’s lives outside of the centre. Centre leaders are committed to extending these opportunities to a wider group of teachers and parents to benefit children. Parents interviewed by ERO during the review expressed appreciation for the warm, welcoming approach of teachers and their genuine enthusiasm for the care and education of their children.</p><p>Effective leadership is provided by experienced Kidicorp management personnel. The well-qualified and knowledgeable centre management team work in a collaborative and effective partnership with these Kidicorp leaders. Together they set clear direction for staff in the provision of high quality education and care. The centre works in positive partnership with external and specialist agencies. Children with special needs are included in all aspects of the programme.</p><p>Recent self review has led to increased flexibility with routines and the use of the environment to respond to children’s interests and needs. Children are benefitting from extensive opportunities to interact in mixed-age social groups. Transitions within the centre are well planned and contribute to children’s wellbeing and sense of belonging. Teachers recognise the importance of including the wider world in children’s learning and make good use of the local and wider environment through trips and adventures, both planned and spontaneous.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids to Five on Dey Street completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Kids to Five on Dey Street will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>17 July 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
