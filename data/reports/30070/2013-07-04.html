</table><p>Central Kids Kindergartens – Northwood is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens – Northwood is located in the Nukuhau suburb of Taupo. It provides education and care for children from two years to school age. The kindergarten is licensed for 45 children and at the time of this review had a roll of 70, including 18 who identify as Māori. The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust, (known as Central Kids).</p><p>At the beginning of 2013 the kindergarten changed its operating hours to include opportunities for children to participate in a sessional, as well as an 8.30am to 2.30pm full day programme. A new head teacher started at the kindergarten in March 2013.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in 2010, the local community has funded considerable improvements to the kindergarten’s environment. These have included a major redevelopment of the outdoor play area. Teachers have undertaken ongoing professional development to enhance their teaching practice. One teacher has been involved in the Tuwharetoa Cultural Knowledge Project which has strengthened ties with Ngāti Tuwharetoa and local mārae. This initiative has supported a sense of belonging and identity for Māori children and their families.</p><p>The kindergarten has responded positively to the area for development in the previous ERO review about strengthening aspects of teaching practices.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 13 reviews in the Central Kids umbrella organisation. Delete if</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from participating in a programme that is responsive to their emerging interests. Literacy and mathematics learning is effectively integrated into children’s learning through play activities. Many opportunities are provided for children to explore and experience safe physical challenge. Children are able to access a wide range of high quality resources and equipment, including computer technology. They are encouraged to develop their independence and self-management skills. An advantage of the change of operating hours has been the increased opportunities for older children to play alongside, and support, their younger peers. Children enjoy regular trips into the local and wider community. A feature of the programme is the participation in the annual Tuwharetoa Kapa Haka Festival.</p><p>The recently appointed head teacher has successfully focused on establishing a collegial teaching team. She has worked with teachers to review and refine kindergarten operations in response to the changes in the kindergarten’s operating hours. The head teacher has built positive relationships with parents and children. She models effective teaching practices that engage children in learning. Under the guidance of the head teacher the kindergarten’s well-developed self review practices have been maintained and further enhanced. These processes contribute to, and support, ongoing kindergarten sustainability.</p><p>A special feature of the kindergarten is the high levels of parent involvement and support. Many parents take the opportunity to play alongside their children during the kindergarten programme. Parents are well informed about their children’s involvement in the programme through attractively presented individual profiles, and regular informal discussions with teachers. Transitions into the kindergarten and on to school are well supported by planned meetings between teachers and parents.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families well. They use a wide-range of strategies that engage and support children in meaningful play. They model respectful and inclusive interactions with children, parents and their colleagues. ERO observed many examples of children working together in small groups for sustained periods of time. Teachers effectively enhance children’s oral language skills by engaging with them in extended conversations.</p><p>The kindergarten continues to receive good quality support from Central Kids. The newly appointed professional leader has established positive relationships with the head teacher and staff. Comprehensive policy guidelines assist staff to meet regulatory requirements and Central Kids’ high standards and expectations.</p><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the effectiveness of the kindergarten’s responsibilities for employment and management of staff. Central Kids have developed and implemented highly effective processes to appoint and support staff at the kindergarten.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>The head teacher has begun a process to develop a shared vision for the kindergarten involving teachers, parents, children and Central Kids.</p><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the next step is to align this vision with the key aspects of kindergarten operations including:</p><ul>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation practices</li>
<li>teacher appraisal and professional development</li>
<li>embedding bicultural practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Northwood completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Northwood will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>4 July 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
