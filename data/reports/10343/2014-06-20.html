<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Background</span></h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Fun Kids Learning Centre governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the May 2013 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>the quality of the centre&rsquo;s curriculum, including planning, implementation and evaluation</li>
<li>the quality of self review, and the extent to which it helps maintain and improve the quality of care and education provided for children</li>
<li>any other issues relevant to the management and operation of the centre that arise during the course of the review.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><p>The centre is now well placed to continue improving its performance and to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fun Kids Learning Centre in Manukau, Auckland, provides all-day or sessional care for up to 20 children. The centre operates in a modified house in a residential area and serves a culturally diverse community. Currently, almost all the children are over three years of age. The owner, supervisor and two other staff are qualified teachers.</p><p>This is the third ERO review of the centre since a change of ownership in 2011. Since ERO&rsquo;s 2013 review, the owner has enlisted the support of a mentor to help establish appropriate management practices and has attended a course to learn about staff performance appraisal. The teaching team has also benefited from professional development and support relating to self review and programme management and implementation.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>The owner, supervisor and teachers have made good progress in improving areas of concern identified by ERO in 2013. They have established a sound foundation for further improvements.</p><p>The teaching team has become more cohesive as a result of an improved, shared understanding of good quality early childhood education programmes. The owner and teachers have undertaken an in-depth review of their vision, values and philosophy of teaching and learning, and have developed a greater commitment to improving their teaching practice.</p><p>The children are confident communicators and capable learners. They work together cooperatively, especially in imaginative family play, and sustain their focus for long periods. Good levels of social interaction are evident. Children readily take leadership roles in the programme. Caring relationships with families and children and a settled, family-like atmosphere are positive features of the centre.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s environment is enriched by vibrant displays that reflect children&rsquo;s and teachers&rsquo; diverse cultural backgrounds and show cultural practices included in the programme. Play areas are well organised and presented. Teachers have reviewed and upgraded the outdoor play area.</p><p>Teachers work well alongside children and now show greater recognition of the value of child-initiated learning. Children enjoy books and experiment appropriately with drawing and writing. Teachers&rsquo; conversations with children show that they know them well. Some teachers provide especially good support for children&rsquo;s language development and communication skills.</p><p>Teachers are moving towards a more responsive, child-led curriculum. They are now more aware of individual children&rsquo;s interests, which they record to inform monthly planning. Staff are becoming more confident in this work and have developed some good examples of learning story assessments for children. A current professional development contract is focused on further improving teachers&rsquo; assessment, planning and evaluation practices.</p><p>Key strategic goals for the centre provide a good basis for ongoing development. Useful plans guide progress towards goals. The owner, supervisor and teachers have established a process for reviewing centre operations. The new staff appraisal process should help to evaluate teaching practices and promote ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>The owner and supervisor recognise that continuing professional learning should support the supervisor in her leadership role and help her to promote further improvements in centre practices.</p><p>Agreed key next steps for continuing development include:</p><ul>
<li>deepening self review and identifying outcomes for children as a result of change</li>
<li>improving teaching practice through more robust evaluation and implementation of the newly established teacher appraisal process</li>
<li>systematically reviewing and improving areas of play to ensure children have easy access to a wider range of good quality, challenging, educational equipment and resources that promote children&rsquo;s creativity</li>
<li>building teachers&rsquo; confidence in their teaching and the quality of their interactions to better promote children&rsquo;s thinking and problem solving skills and to support them to engage in more complex play</li>
<li>better documenting parents&rsquo; conversations with teachers about children&rsquo;s learning and making clearer links with the day-to-day programme planning.</li>
