<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>There are many elements of the programme and practices that support positive outcomes for children at the Port Chalmers Kindergarten.</p><p>Children play and learn in a new purpose- built Kindergarten. Their teachers are supporting them to learn how to use the new space and how to play well together. Children enjoy a range of interesting experiences in and out of the kindergarten.</p><p>The teaching team have managed a number of changes including the rebuilding of the kindergarten well. They have good support from Dunedin Kindergartens (DK).</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. To reach these findings ERO evaluates:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how governance and management determines the service&rsquo;s vision/philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how the leadership and capability of all involved, including educators, enhances positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is implemented to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning reflect diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of partnerships with wh&#257;nau and self review. ERO evaluates how well placed the centre is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at Port Chalmers Kindergarten.</p><h3>How well placed is Port Chalmers Kindergarten to promote positive learning outcomes for children?</h3><h4>Context</h4><p>This review was conducted as part of a trial of ERO&rsquo;s revised approaches to reviews in early childhood education services. The trial used a cluster approach for the reviews of three kindergartens within the Dunedin Kindergarten umbrella organisation.</p><p>Port Chalmers kindergarten is one of 22 kindergartens under the umbrella of Dunedin Kindergartens (DK). There has been a number of changes since the last review. These include the construction of a new purpose-built kindergarten on the existing site, changes to the teaching team and increasing the roll to cater for up to 43 children aged two to five years. There have been many new children enrolled in the kindergarten in the first few months of 2012.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Children and their families benefit from warm and caring relationships with their teachers. Teachers know the children and their families well. Parents are welcome to stay and spend time in the kindergarten and make use of the wh&#257;nau room.</p><p>Records of learning show that teachers make good use of the information that some parents provide to plan learning programmes that are relevant for their children. The next step is for them to find ways to know what all parents' aspirations for their children are and use these in their planning. The environment and programme reflect the local identity of the Port Chalmers Community.</p><p>Positive features are:</p><ul>
<li>group learning programmes which have clear intentions for learning</li>
<li>many opportunities for children to build on and revisit meaningful prior learning</li>
<li>teachers thoughtfully supporting and extending children in their learning.</li>
<li>the purposeful integration of M&#257;ori perspectives into the kindergarten programme and environment</li>
<li>many children settled and focussed in their play and making choices about what they want to do in the programme.</li>
</ul><p>The teaching team are ably led by the head teacher. She has led the team, and the community through a major building project. This included relocating the kindergarten for a period of time to an alternative location.</p><p>The kindergarten team is well supported by the senior teachers of the DK. Teachers received additional support during the building project. They also receive good support for ongoing professional learning. The DK managers and governors have a clear strategic direction and a sound policy framework to support the kindergartens.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>Teachers are beginning to use self review as a means to improve aspects of the programme and practices. The quality of self review would be further improved if the teachers developed indicators of best practice to measure their progress. This would be especially helpful when reviewing how effective their philosophy is reflected in practices and in the programme.</p><p>A recent self review about social competency has led to improvements in some children's behaviour. Teachers should continue to focus on building social competency so that the children can take good care of themselves, each other and their new environment.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Port Chalmers Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement</em> and <em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select have/have not taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2><p>ERO and the centre managers agree that they continue to strengthen self-review processes and broaden the scope of reviews.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>31 July 2012</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup>
