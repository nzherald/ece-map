<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The centre is becoming better placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Educare Apirana in Glen Innes is a purpose built early childhood centre owned and operated by Kidicorp Ltd. The centre was established in 2008 and was first reviewed by ERO in March 2010. That review identified good systems for operating the centre and recommended that improvements be made in curriculum and personnel management.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s two original licences have since been merged into a single licence for 70 children, including 20 under two years of age. Programmes are provided for age related groups of children with a head teacher responsible in each of the three rooms. The centre was relicensed in 2012 under the 2008 ECE regulations.</p><p>Ongoing changes in leadership since 2010 have limited self review and centre progress. For much of 2012 the centre had no onsite manager. Kidicorp did however provide management expertise during this time, appointing a new business manager and ensuring that the Professional Services Manager (PSM) continued to support staff. Kidicorp has very recently appointed an experienced centre manager for Educare Apirana.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at Educare Apirana benefit from the care and support they receive from teachers. They are happily involved in the programme throughout the day. Teachers plan different activities and engage with children in play. Continual conversation between children and teachers supports children&rsquo;s communication and oral language development.</p><p>The centre is well used by the local community. More children have been able to attend the centre because a pick up and drop off service for morning and afternoon sessions is provided. Centre managers are building stronger connections with families and wh&#257;nau. They could now support this centre goal by developing more specific plans for improving outcomes for M&#257;ori and Pacific children.</p><p>Babies and infants are well cared for. They have a calm and settled environment and experience consistent nurturing. Sleeping, eating and personal care routines are managed sensitively. Well organised open spaces and appropriate resources allow young children to investigate their surroundings. Staff are gentle in their interactions with infants, reassuring them and encouraging their exploration.</p><p>Children in the toddlers and pre-school rooms enjoy the well resourced indoor and outdoor environments that encourage creative play and physical activity. Positive and respectful relationships with teachers support children&rsquo;s social development. Children are confident and trusting of their teachers and participate in activities that teachers prepare. All children enjoy the varied menu and nutritious food provided by the full time cook.</p><p>Teachers in each of the three rooms are reviewing their observation and assessment practices. Teachers recognise children&rsquo;s interests and comment on their learning preferences and next steps. They record these developments and learning experiences in children&rsquo;s individual portfolios. Teachers could now enhance their programme planning by responding more specifically to children&rsquo;s identified needs and interests.</p><p>Over the past six months the PSM has conducted in-depth reviews and guided improvements in many areas of centre operations. Together with the centre&rsquo;s new business manager, the PSM has reviewed policies and procedures, assessed learning environments and observed teaching practices. Priorities for improvement and a planned approach to implementing change have been established. They have also:</p><ul>
<li>updated strategic and annual planning systems</li>
<li>reviewed the centre philosophy</li>
<li>enhanced the roles of the three individual room leaders</li>
<li>reviewed resources and organisation of the environment</li>
<li>strengthened team work and professional learning</li>
<li>implemented a purposeful staff appraisal system.</li>
</ul><p>Educare Apirana is now poised and ready for further development. Systematic self review has identified key areas for further improvement and planning procedures are in place to support centre progress. The challenge for the recently appointed centre manager will be to sustain recent improvements and continue to strengthen centre operation.</p><p>Centre managers agree that priorities for ongoing development include:</p><ul>
<li>aligning children&rsquo;s interests with programme planning and assessment</li>
<li>increasing opportunities for children to contribute to the programme</li>
<li>extending teachers&rsquo; knowledge of child-centred practices</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen relationships with parents and whanau.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO encourages Kidicorp to maintain support for the new centre manager during the next stage of development. Maintaining a focus on professional learning will be a key to strengthening teacher practice.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edukids Apirana completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>17 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
