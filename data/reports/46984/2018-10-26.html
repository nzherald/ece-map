</table><p>Little Hands Childcare &amp; Early Learning Centre is in the early stages of developing an effective management and leadership framework. Leaders and teachers have yet to put in place management and teaching systems and practices that promote ongoing improvement.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Hands Childcare &amp; Early Learning Centre is privately owned. Leaders and teachers provide care and education for children from birth to school age. The centre is licensed for 38 children, including up to 10 under two years of age. The largest group of children at this centre is Māori. The owner takes responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the centre. This is the centre's first ERO review.</p><p>Children learn and play in two separate rooms. One is for children up to the age of two years and the other room is for the older group of children. The centre's philosophy emphasises the belief that children learn through play.</p><p>Families from a variety of cultural backgrounds attend the centre and staffing reflects this diversity. The majority of children are learning English as an additional language.</p><p>Since the centre opened in 2016, there has been a significant number of staff changes. An existing team leader was appointed to the role of centre supervisor. Most staff are qualified early childhood teachers. A cook provides nutritious snacks and meals for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and happily engaged in their learning. They have many opportunities to choose their interests from an appropriate range of resources and equipment in attractive, well-presented indoor and outdoor environments.</p><p>Children experience respectful relationships with each other, their teachers and other staff. Teachers view children as independent, active, diverse, confident learners. They show care and concern for children's wellbeing and build children's sense of belonging while they are at the centre.</p><p>Teachers foster children's creativity through readily available art resources. They skilfully incorporate mathematics concepts and language development opportunities in meaningful play experiences.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are cared for and learn in a nurturing, calm environment. Teachers gently support children. They express aroha openly within their caring interactions with children. Toddlers have regular access to the older children's play areas. This strongly supports their transition into the older group.</p><p>Transition into the centre is family-led and well managed. Teachers support children's successful transition to school by helping them develop independence and self-help skills.</p><p>Parents are well informed about their children's learning and participation in the programme. The centre has introduced an online digital platform so parents are able to receive real-time information.</p><p>Teachers meet regularly to discuss centre operations, children's assessment and their planning and evaluation processes. There are some useful examples of learning stories that assess children's learning and development. Leaders now need to place more emphasis on planning for children's next learning steps. This planning should identify intentional teaching strategies to extend children's learning.</p><p>The owner and supervisor work closely together and share centre responsibilities. They are yet to strongly link strategic planning to positive learning outcomes for children. Leaders support teachers to increase their capability and ensure they have access to a range of professional learning and development opportunities. Leaders should ensure that teachers and staff are involved in whole-centre professional learning. This would help to build a shared understanding for staff about good quality systems and practices for sustainability and improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establishing clear, shared expectations for assessment, planning and evaluation, to ensure a strong emphasis on learning and teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen teachers' understanding of bicultural practices in the context of Aotearoa New Zealand and the Treaty of Waitangi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop and implement the appraisal process to build teacher capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>redesign the strategic plan and develop annual action plans to ensure a stronger focus on positive learning outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen internal evaluation by evaluating the impact of changes on outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Hands Childcare &amp; Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified non-compliance relating to appraisal. The service needs to implement a regular system of appraisal in order to meet Education Council requirements.</p><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Hands Childcare &amp; Early Learning Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Violet Tu'uga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>26 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
