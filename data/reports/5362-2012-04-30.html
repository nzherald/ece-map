<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Mungavin Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>The kindergarten is situated close to Porirua shopping centre. Since the June 2008 ERO review, there have been staff changes, building alterations and changes to session times. The kindergarten now operates six-hourly sessions from Monday to Friday, with the younger and older children attending on different days. Children attending represent a diverse range of cultural backgrounds, with the majority being M&#257;ori and Pacific.</p><p>Free play is promoted and children make choices from a range of varied and interesting activities. Teachers notice their developing interests and plan experiences or seek material and equipment to support them. Children enjoy using the equipment provided in the indoor and outside areas. Emphasis is given to keeping safe, showing care and respect for each other and looking after the environment.</p><p>Partnership with families is encouraged. Teachers are available at the beginning and end of sessions to talk with parents about their child&rsquo;s involvement in the programme. Wall displays, photographs, slideshows and each child&rsquo;s portfolio show a variety of activities and experiences. The next step is for teachers to document the aspirations parents have for their children. This should help inform programme planning and development.</p><p>Interactions between teachers, children and parents are caring. Children&rsquo;s health and well-being are nurtured with the kindergarten recently receiving a healthy heart award. Teachers are developing their knowledge of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori and children enjoy singing waiata and learning basic greetings.</p><p>Planned in-depth self review to continually enhance outcomes for children is in the early stages of implementation. Since the onsite phase of the review, the association has provided a detailed plan to ERO that shows how it will support the teaching team to address the areas for development and review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Mungavin Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atMungavin Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>This review also includes information about the quality of support provided by the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association).</p><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Since the 2008 ERO review, there have been extensive building alterations with plans to upgrade the outdoor area. The kindergarten now operates six-hourly sessions from Monday to Friday with a staffing increase from three to five fulltime teachers.</p><p>Children attending the kindergarten come from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds, with the majority being M&#257;ori and Pacific. The previous ERO report noted the need to strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation, integrate te reo M&#257;ori and Pacific languages into the programme and review provision for active boys. One teacher is leading development in te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori. Another with Pacific language skills was appointed at the beginning of the year.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>The new teaching team spent considerable time reviewing and developing the centre&rsquo;s philosophy and procedures for assessment, planning and evaluation. The philosophy gives emphasis to children keeping safe, showing care and respect for each other and looking after the environment. Professional discussion has assisted positive teamwork and the development of some shared understandings.</p><p>Children participate in a range of varied learning experiences. These relate to their interests and often result in projects or theme-based activities that are supported by parents, wh&#257;nau and community members. Teachers, with support from the senior teacher, are beginning to record more information about children&rsquo;s learning, through assessment and planning documents.</p><p>Interactions between teachers, children and wh&#257;nau are caring and supportive. Teachers supervise, rove and often help individual or groups of children with ideas, equipment or materials as requested. Children and teachers participate in daily mat times and include sessions to help develop their knowledge of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori. Children&rsquo;s health and well-being are promoted and the kindergarten recently achieved a healthy heart award.</p><p>The environment is welcoming and partnership is promoted. Teachers are available at the beginning and end of sessions to talk with parents about their child&rsquo;s involvement during the session. Parents and wh&#257;nau also learn about the programme through displays, photographs, slideshows and their child&rsquo;s portfolio. These opportunities help build positive partnerships about children&rsquo;s learning and development.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>While teachers are caring, supportive and supervise children well, meaningful interactions to extend learning and development are not a strong feature of their practice. The teaching team is working to implement an effective educational programme for the younger and older children. In particular:</p><ul>
<li>regular, documented programme planning is limited and there is little purposeful, planning to enhance children&rsquo;s early numeracy and literacy learning, especially their oral language skills</li>
<li>while teachers notice children&rsquo;s interests and provide activities to encourage them, they do not always recognise or extend learning over time through the use of consistently responsive teaching practices</li>
<li>teachers are developing ways to document the aspirations parents have for their children, especially those who are M&#257;ori and Pacific. Such information helps to acknowledge children&rsquo;s identity, language and culture and inform programme planning and implementation</li>
<li>planned, in-depth self review is at the early stage of implementation to promote continual improvement.</li>
</ul><p>Ongoing centre-wide development should support the growth of informed leadership within the team to continually improve outcomes for children.</p><h3>Association Support</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy, Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a wide range of professional development opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice, as a result of feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Mungavin Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendations</h2><p>ERO and the centre leaders agree that centre-wide review and development will be undertaken with ongoing support from the senior teacher to ensure:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>curriculum leadership is strengthened to raise the quality and responsiveness of the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effective teaching and learning is implemented on a consistent basis</p>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-mungavin-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Mungavin Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Mungavin Kindergarten.</p><p>Mungavin Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>The kindergarten is situated close to Porirua shopping centre. Since the June 2008 ERO review, there have been staff changes, building alterations and changes to session times. The kindergarten now operates six-hourly sessions from Monday to Friday, with the younger and older children attending on different days. Children attending represent a diverse range of cultural backgrounds, with the majority being M&#257;ori and Pacific.</p><p>Free play is promoted and children make choices from a range of varied and interesting activities. Teachers notice their developing interests and plan experiences or seek material and equipment to support them. Children enjoy using the equipment provided in the indoor and outside areas. Emphasis is given to keeping safe, showing care and respect for each other and looking after the environment.</p><p>Partnership with families is encouraged. Teachers are available at the beginning and end of sessions to talk with parents about their child&rsquo;s involvement in the programme. Wall displays, photographs, slideshows and each child&rsquo;s portfolio show a variety of activities and experiences. The next step is for teachers to document the aspirations parents have for their children. This should help inform programme planning and development.</p><p>Interactions between teachers, children and parents are caring. Children&rsquo;s health and well-being are nurtured with the kindergarten recently receiving a healthy heart award. Teachers are developing their knowledge of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori and children enjoy singing waiata and learning basic greetings.</p><p>Planned in-depth self review to continually enhance outcomes for children is in the early stages of implementation. Since the onsite phase of the review, the association has provided a detailed plan to ERO that shows how it will support the teaching team to address the areas for development and review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
