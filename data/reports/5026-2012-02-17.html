<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p align="left">Torbay Kindergarten operates as part of the Northern Auckland Kindergarten Association in a residential area of the North Shore, Auckland. Since 2008 the kindergarten has diversified and now offers a school-day model as well as sessional education for children from the local area. The Association provides manuals to guide the operations of the kindergarten, professional development and regular visits from a Teaching Services Manager. A committee drawn from the parent group fund-raises successfully for additional resources and changes to the environment.</p>
<p align="left">Children attending the kindergarten receive a rich programme that is focused on extending their confidence and competence. Literacy, science and mathematics are presented in the context of children&rsquo;s interests. As a result children develop understanding about a wide range of concepts.</p>
<p align="left">The kindergarten&rsquo;s physical environment has been developed to deepen children&rsquo;s understanding of the natural world. The &lsquo;secret garden&rsquo; produces a range of vegetables and the New Zealand native plant garden is a popular and attractive area for play.</p>
<p align="left">The teaching team has grown with the change to the school-day model. The team is working cohesively and effectively. This is a result of careful analysis of how to manage their work with children in the most advantageous ways.</p>
<p align="left">Families and children are welcomed into the centre and a sense of warm inclusion is evident. Children settle well. Teachers have reviewed biculturalism in their kindergarten. As a consequence, they have strengthened their commitment to serving M&#257;ori families well and made this more visible.</p>
<p align="left">The kindergarten continues to provide an environment for children that strengthens their sense of themselves as capable and competent learners.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p align="left">Before the review, the management of Torbay Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atTorbay Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p align="left">The 2008 ERO report noted good quality practices and a settled team of teachers. Changes since 2008 have been absorbed into the operation of the kindergarten with careful consideration given to the impacts on children as well as on teachers. Particular care has been taken to minimise disruption to smoothly flowing programmes.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p align="left"><strong>Outcomes for children</strong>. Children make confident choices and enjoy their play. Teachers encourage them to explore their interests and the current topic. They are able to concentrate for considerable periods, demonstrating competence and confidence in their ability as learners. Children are eager to be extended in their learning and participate with pleasure in opportunities to share their knowledge.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Positive guidance.</strong> Teachers are affirming with children. They model respectful relationships and are consistent in their approaches to positive guidance. Teachers build children&rsquo;s confidence and self esteem in managing social relationships effectively. Children work cooperatively, negotiating their roles in games and activities, and good friendships are evident. These good practices support the development of children&rsquo;s understanding about expectations for behaviour and self management. As a result children are settled and independent.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Teaching and learning.</strong> Teachers work collegially. Communication about their work is reflective and open. Programmes for children are built around their strengths and interests. This often takes the form of centre-wide topics that engage children in art, writing, reading and vocabulary and theatre production skills. As a result of these experiences, children are confident about sharing their knowledge and learning with others, and working together towards a shared outcome. Teachers appropriately use open-ended questioning techniques to encourage children&rsquo;s confidence in expressing themselves and to discover what children understand. It would be useful for teachers to encourage children&rsquo;s general conversation in this way.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Literacy mathematics and science</strong>. Teachers support children&rsquo;s emerging literacy science and numeracy knowledge by providing the opportunities and resources to encourage exploration of these skills. Some children demonstrate well developed reading and writing skills and use these talents to record their own thoughts and knowledge to share with others. Oral literacy is a strength with children confidently speaking and performing before others. Mathematics is woven into children&rsquo;s play as games and opportunities to work with numbers. Simple sums give children opportunities to practice numeracy skills in playful situations.</p>
<p align="left">Children&rsquo;s knowledge about the natural world has been reinforced by the provision of a library of reference books, use of the internet, and opportunities to be involved in gardening and eating their own produce. Interactive and attractive displays encourage children&rsquo;s exploration.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Environment</strong>. Teachers have created an environment that arouses children&rsquo;s interest and investigation. High quality, plentiful equipment and resources are accessible and arranged in ways that encourage children to be creative.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers make effective use of the covered deck area to provide additional space for quiet activities.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Bicultural focus.</strong> Teachers undertook a detailed self-review to determine how best to support biculturalism in the kindergarten. Many of the actions that led from the review involved changing the environment and resources. In addition teachers sought support from a teacher of M&#257;ori from a local school. As a consequence of this contact, the kindergarten was able to share learning, teaching and demonstrations at the school.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p align="left">ERO and teachers agreed after discussion that the areas they should focus on next will be to:</p>
<ul>
<li>continue to strengthen children&rsquo;s play through support and conversation</li>
<li>include more authentic child and parent voices in portfolios</li>
<li>keep the balance of teacher and child ideas in the programme</li>
<li>include parents more overtly in determining goals for their children</li>
<li>focus self review on determining the effectiveness of teaching practices and outcomes for children.</li>
</ul>
<a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3>
<p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing wellbeing, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p align="left">The kindergarten has attracted a number of families who have children with special needs. The teaching team has considerable experience in working with children with special needs. In addition the association has provided professional development to assist teachers to plan and provide programmes.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p align="left">Inclusion. Teachers are very welcoming to parents and children. The sense of inclusion in the kindergarten extends to embrace all the children who attend. Teachers have welcomed any children with special needs from families that have chosen to use the kindergarten. They have also been proactive in seeking additional support for children causing concern and work closely with support agencies. Transition to the kindergarten and on to school is managed in supportive, gentle ways to suit children&rsquo;s needs.</p>
<p align="left">Consistency. The consistency of approaches and the mild formality to each day in the kindergarten helps those children at risk of not feeling part of routines. Activities that encourage those children with special needs to involve themselves are carefully planned and provided to keep everyone safe. The kindergarten provides a stable environment for children with special needs.</p>
<a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Torbay Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<a id="5-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Recommendations</h2>
<p align="left">ERO and the centre managers agree that the kindergarten should continue to use self-review processes to consider and determine the effectiveness of all aspects of teaching practices.</p>
<a id="6-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6. Future Action</h2>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>

<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-torbay-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Torbay Kindergarten</h2>
<p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Torbay Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">Torbay Kindergarten operates as part of the Northern Auckland Kindergarten Association in a residential area of the North Shore, Auckland. Since 2008 the kindergarten has diversified and now offers a school-day model as well as sessional education for children from the local area. The Association provides manuals to guide the operations of the kindergarten, professional development and regular visits from a Teaching Services Manager. A committee drawn from the parent group fund-raises successfully for additional resources and changes to the environment.</p>
<p align="left">Children attending the kindergarten receive a rich programme that is focused on extending their confidence and competence. Literacy, science and mathematics are presented in the context of children&rsquo;s interests. As a result children develop understanding about a wide range of concepts.</p>
<p align="left">The kindergarten&rsquo;s physical environment has been developed to deepen children&rsquo;s understanding of the natural world. The &lsquo;secret garden&rsquo; produces a range of vegetables and the New Zealand native plant garden is a popular and attractive area for play.</p>
<p align="left">The teaching team has grown with the change to the school-day model. The team is working cohesively and effectively. This is a result of careful analysis of how to manage their work with children in the most advantageous ways.</p>
<p align="left">Families and children are welcomed into the centre and a sense of warm inclusion is evident. Children settle well. Teachers have reviewed biculturalism in their kindergarten. As a consequence, they have strengthened their commitment to serving M&#257;ori families well and made this more visible.</p>
<p align="left">The kindergarten continues to provide an environment for children that strengthens their sense of themselves as capable and competent learners.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>
