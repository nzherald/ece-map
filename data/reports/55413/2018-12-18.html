</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids Count Tawa - The Griffin School is a privately-owned early learning service situated in Tawa. It operates adjacent to the Teen Parent Unit that is a part of Wellington East Girls' College. Many mothers study in the adjacent classroom and have easy access to their children.</p><p>The service is licensed for 39 children, including 32 up to two years of age, and 10 children from the local community. At the time of this ERO review just over half of the children enrolled identified as Māori. Groups of children aged under and over two each have their own area of the centre.</p><p>Since the January 2016 ERO report, the centre has been purchased by Auckland-based, Kids Count Limited. These owners provide regular governance and management support to the centre. The new centre manager, appointed early in 2017, is responsible for the day-to-day running of the centre. She is supported by two team leaders, with one also appointed in 2017.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have continued to strengthen practice in the areas identified in the previous ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy and vision are highly evident in practice. Whanaungatanga underpins relationships that are warm and friendly. Children and their mothers demonstrate a strong sense of belonging within an inclusive environment. Their needs and circumstances are sensitively considered and their mana respected.</p><p>Teachers are highly attuned and responsive to children’s interests, abilities and non-verbal communication. They skilfully incorporate new learning opportunities and challenge into play and care moments. Routines are used to build trust and secure emotional attachments.</p><p>Babies and toddlers enjoy freedom of movement in their own area. Natural spaces, indoors and out, stimulate their interest and encourage them to be active explorers. They are supported to develop a strong sense of self and to transition to the older age group at their own pace.</p><p>Children of all cultures are supported to develop a positive understanding of their heritage. Māori children are authentically immersed in their culture. Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are highly evident throughout the curriculum and centre environment. Teachers are currently deepening their knowledge of each child’s background and cultural heritage for further integration in learning.</p><p>Leaders are successfully building high-quality assessment practices and agree the next step is to promote greater consistency of practice across the team. Children's learning portfolios demonstrate how teachers effectively use intentional, specific teaching strategies to promote new learning. Evidence of each child's progress is captured and used to inform individualised future learning opportunities. Regular and in-depth conversations with parents and other family members further inform the learning activities. These support the development of meaningful parent partnerships.</p><p>Leaders have developed a very supportive organisational culture that is purposefully focused on collaboration and improvement. The centre manager sets well considered priorities and advocates strongly for children and their parents. She seeks ways to include them in all areas of decision making and supports the implementation of their ideas to enhance the curriculum.</p><p>Teachers are challenged to continually improve their practice as engaged professionals throughout a strengthened appraisal process. Beginning teachers are well supported through regular observations and discussions of their practice.</p><p>Governors set a very clear strategic direction for the centre. Positive outcomes and wellbeing are prioritised for children and their whānau. They look for opportunities to remove barriers, both economic and social, to the success and wellbeing of all involved.</p><p>Strong systems and processes are in place to monitor and guide centre operation. Management and governors provide robust guidance for policies and planning. Rigorous monthly checks gather information on how learners can be further supported.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are reflective and improvement focused. They seek to identify how changes to teacher practice impacts on children's learning. They regularly consult with whānau and make good use of current research to identify, and then implement, well considered improvements that benefit children. The service is now well positioned to evaluate the extent to which teaching and learning practices support improved outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers should continue to develop their capacity and capability to effectively evaluate their practice and outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids Count Tawa - The Griffin School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids Count Tawa - The Griffin School will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>18 December 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
