</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidz Rock Early Learning Centre is a privately owned education and care service situated in Rotorua. The service operates between 7.30am and 5.30pm, Monday to Friday. It caters for up to 30 children from birth to school age including up to eight children under two years of age, in a mixed age-group setting. Currently 22 children are enrolled of whom eight are identified as Māori. The centre also caters for children from other ethnic groups.</p><p>The centre manager/owner and the head teacher continue to work together to provide a strong structure for governance and management. The centre maintains a high proportion of qualified teachers. Together they lead and implement a philosophy that is focused on fostering children's individual uniqueness through a child-initiated programme.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO and since the previous ERO review has developed a revised strategic plan that sets direction for on-going improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play and learn in a calm and warmly welcoming environment. They benefit from a mixed-age setting for learning that supports tuakana/teina interactions, which promote leadership responsibilities and nurture caring relationships among children. Children up to two years of age are well cared for and fully participate alongside older children. A well-developed, spacious outdoor playground challenges children to engage in physical activity and to explore the natural world. Children are confident and competent learners who form friendships and have a strong sense of belonging in the centre.</p><p>The centre supports the diverse range of language, culture and identity of children attending. A special feature is the rich bicultural practice and everyday use of te reo and tikanga Māori. This reflects the centre philosophy that values the cultural heritage of Aotearoa. The head teacher's expertise and leadership promotes the continuing enhancement of te ao Māori for teachers, children and their families.</p><p>Teachers know children and their parents well, and maintain positive, trusting and reciprocal relationships. They support them to develop social skills through positive guidance and problem solving. Teachers listen to children, respond to their ideas and foster the development of rich oral language. They encourage children to research, using digital learning tools to extend their understanding of the world around them. Teachers respect children's voice and affirm and enrich their learning choices. These effective teaching practices enhance children's sense of themselves as successful learners who are confident in expressing their needs and interests.</p><p>Teachers plan the programme to reflect and extend children's interests. They intentionally include mathematics and literacy, which appears as a natural part of the learning programme. Children enjoy sharing books and experience mathematical ideas in a wide range of activities. The centre includes many opportunities for children to explore the living world as they care for the gardens and centre pets, search for insects, and participate in trips and excursions. Children have developed whakakaitiakitanga within the world around them, as their idea of health and nutrition is supported through harvesting, preparing and discussing the value of healthy food.</p><p>Leaders are committed to achieving strong partnerships with parents and whānau. They believe in an inclusive culture of learning for children, parents/whānau, teachers and leaders. Parents are actively involved as partners in their children's learning. New parents appreciate the welcoming environment. They are able to spend time in the centre settling their children into the programme. Teachers acknowledge whānau aspirations for their children and maintain close communication about children's learning and wellbeing. Parents are well informed about children's learning through face-to-face discussions. Teachers record learning and progress in individual learning journals for children and whānau to share and revisit. The centre staff provide good support for families and children when they transition to school.</p><p>The skilled leaders have established a highly reflective and collaborative teaching team who share a common philosophy and vision. The manager and head teacher provide effective mentoring and coaching to build teacher capability and capacity for leadership. Leaders identify areas for professional development through the appraisal process, and seek guidance and resources to support ongoing improvement.</p><p>The centre has undertaken good quality self-review to evaluate and improve authentic relationships with whānau and mathematics teaching and learning. Leaders recognise the value of recording details of spontaneous self-review initiatives to assist the evaluation of their effectiveness in improving outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers agree that leaders should further develop assessment specifically in children's learning journals:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>to reflect children's identity, family connections, whānau feedback and child's voice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to document assessments based on Te Whatu Pōkeka model.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition centre leaders should strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the appraisal process by ensuring that teachers' documents link between their records of evidence and the Practising Teachers Criteria. Appraisers should provide feedback and feedforward about teaching practice, to the appraisee</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sustainability for the centre through ongoing monitoring of self review.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidz Rock Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidz Rock Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>28 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
