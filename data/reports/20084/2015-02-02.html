</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres (3) is an established service located in the suburb of Grey Lynn, Auckland. It caters for parents/whānau working in the inner city and surrounding areas. The centre is licensed for 50 children from three years to school age, including up to 20 children aged under two years. The centre provides good education and care for babies, toddlers and preschool children.</p><p>Kindercare Learning Centres (KLC) organisation provides effective advice and support for the centre operations. The values of ‘Safe, Loved and Learning’ underpin the centre’s vision and future direction. The philosophy clearly outlines the intentions of the centre and is a useful guide for staff. It focuses on providing an environment of care and education for all children.</p><p>A noteworthy feature of Kindercare Learning Centres (3) is the historical importance of its location. Children benefit from learning about the ‘old well’ that sits within the stone wall of the centre and the corner store that once occupied the site.</p><p>Centre managers have responded well to the 2012 ERO report. Teachers continue to explore ways to extend the learning of the older children in the context of play. Self-review processes have been refined to support and develop teaching practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and settled at the centre. They are confident learners and can talk with their teachers and peers about their learning. Children have access to resources that challenge and support their learning. Babies, toddlers and older children have free access between the indoor and outdoor environments. The well-designed outdoor area provides plenty of opportunities for children’s exploration. Established trees, gardens and walkways create a sense of peace and quiet far removed from the busy city surroundings.</p><p>Relationships between teachers and children are positive. Teachers are welcoming, caring and respectful with children. They recognise and respond to children’s individual interests. Babies receive a high level of care. Teachers have developed a specific philosophy for infants to promote responsive approaches to their wellbeing.</p><p>Teachers provide a programme that is unhurried and an environment that is orderly. They encourage children to be independent and self-help skills are promoted. Literacy, mathematics and science are integrated and well supported throughout the programme.</p><p>There are good processes for supporting children’s transitions into, within and out of the centre. Teachers are developing strong relationships with nearby schools. These links are helping teachers to strengthen their knowledge of and skills in te reo and tikanga Māori.</p><p>A focus on inclusiveness and open communication with parents/whānau is evident. A current focus for the centre is to strengthen this relationship and increase parent input into the planning of their child’s learning. A recent initiative to introduce an electronic system for parent feedback on planning and assessment is positively impacting children’s learning.</p><p>Centre leadership is effective. Good working relationships between the KLC area manager, centre director, and teachers contribute to a centre that is reflective and future focused. Teachers have a commitment to ongoing individual and whole-centre professional learning. Teachers respect bicultural practices and the unique place of Māori in Aotearoa New Zealand. They plan to incorporate this focus into teacher’s performance appraisal goals.</p><p>The centre is well governed and managed. The KLC leadership structure with clearly defined roles guides the centre’s operations and enables the centre to sustain and build on current good practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers and KLC managers agree that key priorities for the centre to move forward are to continue strengthening:</p><ul>
<li>bicultural practices across all areas of the centre</li>
<li>documentation of the centre’s strategic plan, as a tool for guiding ongoing improvement.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centre (3) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centre (3) will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>2 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
