</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Jump Start Educare is an all-day service located in Cambridge. It opens between 7.30 am and 5.30 pm on week days. The centre is licensed for 80 children, including up to 24 children under two years of age. The roll has increased significantly since the 2013 ERO review, and now includes similar numbers of Māori and Pākehā children. Whānau/parents can choose to base their children in one of the two mixed-age rooms. Most babies and toddlers are based in the Kowhai room, which is designed to be developmentally appropriate for this age group. Children are able to transition to the busier Rimu room when they are ready.</p><p>The service is privately owned, and one of the partners attends the centre weekly. The centre manager acts as head teacher, and is also team leader for the Rimu room. Another fully registered teacher has responsibility for leading the Kowhai room. The centre is staffed by five fully registered teachers, one provisionally registered teacher, and a recently graduated teacher awaiting provisional registration. Two other teachers have professional qualifications.</p><p>The centre philosophy values the dual heritage of Aotearoa, and states that children come first. It identifies the importance of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>focusing the programme on children learning through play in a mixed-age environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting children's responsive and reciprocal relationships with teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing collaborative relationships with parents/whanau and the wider community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>empowering children to drive and extend all their learning pathways</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encouraging children to become confident and capable participants in their own learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. The 2013 ERO report identified that the centre was committed to acknowledging and celebrating New Zealand's bicultural heritage. The centre has adopted an increased focus on bicultural and multi-cultural inclusiveness.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review the centre has had a considerable change of staffing. A high proportion of teachers has undertaken professional development about positive teaching practice to promote and support whanaungatanga as the basis for developing a more bicultural centre. Leaders have recently attended a conference for early childhood teachers that placed a strong emphasis on bicultural learning and teaching.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are developing as confident learners. They are able to pursue their interests, make good choices and learn about the world around them. All children and their families/whānau are welcomed to an inclusive, respectful environment that recognises their culture and aspirations. They quickly develop a strong sense of belonging and benefit from trusting relationships with leaders, teachers and support staff. Children settle quickly to play indoors, and move easily into the interesting outdoor playground. They are highly involved in exploring and investigating the wide variety of rich learning opportunities provided for them. Long periods of uninterrupted time allow them to engage in individual or group experiences of their own choice.</p><p>Babies and toddlers experience a comfortable, calm and secure learning space. Their home rhythms are respected, and teachers use consistent caring routines to provide responsive nurturing and communication. Teachers are skilled at interpreting children's body language and support their oral language development through frequent conversations and interactions. Older children from the Rimu room visit the babies and toddlers, joining in tuakana-teina relationships that promote empathy and leadership, and ease transitions within the centre. Younger children are well-supported to develop their physical and social skills, and become increasingly independent and self-managing.</p><p>Positive and highly interactive partnerships with parents are established. Leaders and teachers value the contributions they make to the service. Parents enjoy spending time in the centre and sharing knowledge about their children's home learning. Teachers include parents' aspirations in children's individual programmes. These are implemented during their last year at the centre, and provide experiences and opportunities that assist children and families to prepare for their transition to school.</p><p>Teachers know children very well, and are well prepared to respond to, and celebrate, the diverse cultural values and customs increasingly evident in the centre. Bicultural practices, such as involvement in kapa haka, waiata, hangi and Matariki celebrations and the use of karakia mo te kai are well supported by whānau. This fosters the service's respect for Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The mana and successful participation of Māori children, acknowledges and increases their cultural knowledge and skills of all children.</p><p>Teachers use their knowledge of the principles, goals and learning objectives of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, early childhood curriculum well. Literacy, mathematics, science and the arts are naturally integrated into child-initiated learning, and oral language is strongly supported. Teachers' shared values and philosophy help them to fully include children with additional learning needs, including English language learning. They are reflective practitioners who share their knowledge of children's emerging interests and development, and use these insights to support and extend learning.</p><p>Strong professional leadership guides the service. The manager/head teacher has worked with the owner to recruit and induct a diverse team of competent teachers who strongly support the centre vision and philosophy. The bicultural practice and strong parent partnerships highly evident in the centre have been underpinned by appropriate professional development for leaders and teachers to strengthen their knowledge of te ao Maori practices. Self-review initiatives focus on continuous improvement, and revised appraisal processes enable teachers to evaluate their teaching practice in terms of outcomes for children. The service is well prepared to sustain and further improve its current practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>A centre management plan has been used to guide centre development. Centre managers are now considering developing a more inclusive strategic plan to sustain and continue current developments. Important areas to include are centre strengths such as the partnership with parents and emphasis on success for Māori children as Māori. Consideration should now be given to consulting with staff and parents to obtain their insights and participation.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Jump Start Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Jump Start Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>16 December 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
