</table><p>Banks Peninsula Plunket Community Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Banks Peninsula Plunket Community Preschool is owned and administered by the Royal New Zealand Plunket Society (RNZPS). It is located in Duvauchelle and services the semi-rural community of Banks Peninsula. The centre is open weekdays from 8.15am to 4.15pm and is part of the Whānau Akoranga Kāhui Ako | Community of Learning.</p><p>The centre is licensed to provide education and care for up to 40 children, including up to 10 children under two years of age. Two separate areas are available for the learning and teaching of infants and older children. Children transition between these two rooms as they progress in age and education. The attending families are from a diverse range of cultures.</p><p>The centre manager is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the centre. There has been a number of changes in national managers within RNZPS since the last ERO review.</p><p>The vision of the Banks Peninsula Plunket Community Preschool is 'Learning and journeying together to empower children with a sense of place and purpose in our beautiful, rural community'. The values of the centre are to work in partnership with parents, whānau and the community, recognise each child as a unique learner, provide a richly resourced learning environment, model respectful relationships and acknowledge the dual heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>Beliefs about how children learn include: building on children's interests and current knowledge: ensuring there is a child-initiated play environment that encourages children to interact; supporting children to discover and explore the world; valuing children's culture, language and identity; supporting children to become lifelong learners, and ensuring teachers provide sensitive guidance and support.</p><p>Community consultation is currently underway regarding the centre's operational structure. The centre has made progress in addressing the key next steps from the 2017 ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive relationships are fostered between the centre and parents, and whānau and children. Leaders and teachers works constructively with parents to identify and meet the needs of diverse learners. The well-considered use of digital technologies supports teaching, learning and real-time communication with parents and whānau.</p><p>There is a strong alignment between Te Whāriki, the NZ Early Childhood Curriculum 2017, and the centre's valued outcomes for children. Examples of good learning stories show intentional teaching strategies to support children's learning and progress. The learning of literacy and numeracy skills is woven throughout the curriculum. Routines are flexible and allow children to sustain play.</p><p>Children experience aspects of te ao Māori, including te reo and tikanga Māori. Staff have participated in professional development on bicultural practices, and as a result, there has been continued growth in understanding in this area. The cultures of all children are valued and celebrated in the centre.</p><p>Children under two years of age are well supported to settle into the centre. They benefit from nurturing relationships and a calm unhurried learning environment where their home cultures and routines are respected.</p><p>The centre uses internal evaluation in a meaningful and purposeful way to help develop shared understandings and guidelines for effective practice. There is a collaborative approach to internal evaluation, and parents and whānau are consulted during this process. Internal evaluation is leading to ongoing improvement in learning and teaching.</p><p>Teachers work closely with schools and the wider educational community to improve learning for children and support transitions between preschool and school. Professional learning supports the building of teacher capability and capacity. Centre leaders know teachers' strengths and needs well, and encourage them to work collaboratively and be reflective in their practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the preschool are to improve outcomes for children by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further embedding assessment, planning and evaluation by ensuring that children's goals are individualised and support their learning priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>investigating new ways to further include parent/whānau voice and aspirations in planning and assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to embed the new teacher appraisal system.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To ensure full compliance with the requirements of the NZ Teaching Council, leaders must ensure that observations are completed for all teachers as part of annual appraisal processes.</p><p>The key next steps for the RNZPS are to strengthen and maintain strategic links between governance and management by:</p><ul>
<li>clearly identifying and formalising reporting priorities and requirements, including internal evaluation outcomes, from the centre to the RNZPS</li>
<li>ensuring there is a planned approach to providing quality assurance and support to the centre</li>
<li>strengthening accountability systems to provide the centre and RNZPS with greater assurance about outcomes for all children's learning and wellbeing over time.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Banks Peninsula Plunket Community Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the onsite stage of the review, ERO identified an area of non-compliance:</p><p>The service provider must ensure that parts of the building or buildings used by children have acoustic absorption materials, if necessary, to reduce noise levels that may negatively affect children's learning or wellbeing.</p><p>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, PF12.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>21 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
