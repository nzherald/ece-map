</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Whitiora Kindergarten is situated in the grounds of Whitiora Primary School in Hamilton Central. It provides a mixture of full day and sessional education and care for up to 40 children from two years to school age, at any one time. The kindergarten’s roll reflects the culturally diverse community that it serves. At the time of this ERO review, the roll of 57 included eight Māori, six Asian and 13 Indian children. For many children English is a second language, and nearly a quarter of the children attending are aged between two and three years old.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable trust, and does not operate for profit. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement, ‘Every child reaching their full potential’. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. All kindergartens provide an <em>Enviroschools’</em> focus as a key curriculum feature to encourage children to better understand caring for the environment.</p><p>The Educational Service Manager (ESM) monitors and reports to the association on the kindergarten’s quality of education. A kaumātua from Tainui provides advice, guidance and support about Māori language, culture and identity. The kindergarten’s administrative responsibilities are well supported by association resource personnel. It also benefits from the WKA's clear guidelines and expectations for practice and the availability of good self-review processes for monitoring and evaluating the quality of education and care it provides for children.</p><p>The kindergarten responded positively to the 2011 ERO report. Indoor and outdoor areas have been substantially upgraded. The teaching team has developed more effective strategies of working in partnership with families to support the learning of tamariki Māori and children for whom English is not their first language. The team participated in relevant professional development to support these partnership strategies with a view to benefitting all children.</p><p>The knowledgeable and experienced head teacher and teaching team have worked together for over nine years. They demonstrate a strong commitment to fostering warm and reciprocal relationships, celebrating diversity, and working in partnership with families, whānau Māori and the community to empower children to be capable and competent learners.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 12 kindergarten reviews in the Waikato Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Whitiora Kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Children have good opportunities to become capable and competent learners and communicators. New children thrive in the calm and settled environment and develop a strong sense of belonging. Children play well with and alongside others, quickly learn to express their needs, and share and cooperate with others. A feature is the way the children of mixed ages nurture younger children and include them in their play. Children have frequent opportunities to make decisions about their learning and to practise self-help and care skills. The spacious and well-resourced environment provides a wide variety of challenges for children at different developmental levels.</p><p>Teachers’ interactions with children are consistently gentle, respectful and caring. They are particularly skilled at identifying and responding to the learning and care needs of children under three and those for whom English is not their first language. Teachers value children for who they are, including their diverse languages, cultures and ethnic identities. They skilfully foster the development of social and language skills and integrate learning about literacy, mathematics and science in meaningful ways. Children also have opportunities to design and implement projects that require them to problem solve and further develop self-management skills.</p><p>The teaching team has established effective partnerships with parents based on mutual respect, a willingness to listen, learn and change. Whānau Māori, and families from other cultures, feel that their knowledge and expertise are highly valued. Parents, whānau and children confidently participate in programme planning and often lead significant parts of the programme. Teachers make effective use of whānau aspirations. They use this knowledge, to plan for children’s diverse strengths, needs and interests. Parents are kept well informed about their children’s progress through informal discussions and individual assessment profiles.</p><p>The head teacher provides high-quality professional leadership. She involves all members of the kindergarten community in decision making processes and is well respected by them. Members of the teaching team are empowered to use their strengths and develop their leadership skills. The teaching team are highly reflective. They make effective use of self review and whole team professional development to continually improve their teaching practice. Teachers are strong advocates for children and whānau, and work hard to provide equitable outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teaching team has identified, and ERO agrees, that the next step for teachers is to continue the journey of reviewing planning and assessment practices and displays to deepen parent and whānau understanding of:</p><ul>
<li>learning through play</li>
<li>the processes of identifying and developing learning opportunities to promote children’s emerging interests.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Whitiora Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Whitiora Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>5 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
