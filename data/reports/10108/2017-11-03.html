</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Kindercare Learning Centre in Papatoetoe is a well-established service that operates in purpose built premises. It is licensed for 50 children, including 18 children under two years. Families are culturally diverse. Many children, families and teachers speak more than one language.</p><p>The centre has four separate indoor and outdoor spaces to cater for babies, children aged under two years, toddlers and for children up to school age.</p><p>The Kindercare philosophy and vision of "safe, loved, learning" underpins all practices and developments in the centre. Links are made with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, along with a commitment to meeting the needs of an increasingly diverse community.</p><p>There have been changes in the leadership team during 2017. A new centre manager and a new Kindercare area manager are leading a period of change in the centre. Leaders and teachers are committed to building strong relationships and strengthening learning partnerships with whānau.</p><p>The Kindercare Learning Centres' governance and management organisation has a wide range of systems that underpin centre operations. These include policies, professional development and mentoring programmes for teachers and the provision of support programmes for parents.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three reviews of Kindercare centres.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>There is a warm and inclusive culture in the centre. Children and their whānau are welcomed and unhurried arrival routines allow parents to make contact with teachers each morning. Teachers' caring interactions promote children's wellbeing and foster their sense of belonging. Children are very settled and comfortable in the centre environment and play well alongside each other.</p><p>Children aged up to two years experience an atmosphere of quiet, respectful, responsive care. They are settled and comfortable with their teachers and benefit from warm interactions with all staff. Teachers actively play with children and provide opportunities for children to learn through play. There are very good systems in place for teachers to keep parents well informed about their children’s day.</p><p>Centre programmes and practices also develop children’s knowledge and appreciation of other cultures and languages. Children have many opportunities to hear and use languages other than English. Bilingual and multilingual children and their families are very well supported in the centre.</p><p>Teachers value the knowledge and skills that parents and whānau bring. There are numerous opportunities for families to contribute to learning programmes and to share their languages and cultures. Te Reo Māori is interwoven through the programme and used in waiata and displays.</p><p>Transitions into the centre and between the various rooms are well considered and managed. Parents are able to spend as much time as needed with children as they settle and transition into the centre or into a new room. A specific programme for older children promotes independence, resilience and self-management skills. These skills should assist children when they transition to school. A significant feature of the centre is its links and relationships with local primary schools, with the aim of better supporting children as they start school.</p><p>Teachers collaborate well, communicating with each other and responding quickly to children’s immediate needs. Recent professional learning has influenced teachers' respectful care practices. Leaders and teachers are now using recent professional learning programmes to consider the impacts of their teaching and to plan activities that will further challenge and extend children's thinking and learning.</p><p>Leaders and the centre's internal evaluation practices have a focus on continual improvement. While professional learning programmes are impacting positively on many teachers’ practices, leaders and teachers continue to work towards greater consistency. They are aware of the need to consider the balance between teacher directed activities and responding to learning opportunities that are initiated by children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that the key next steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation to more clearly focus on the impact of teaching practices and learning outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to help teachers to be more intentional in their responses to children's activities in order to challenge and extend learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to build consistent teaching practices across all rooms.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centre - Papatoetoe completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centre - Papatoetoe will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>3 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
