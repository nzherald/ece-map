</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Hillcrest is located in the suburb of Hillcrest, Rotorua. It is licensed to provide all day and sessional care for 40 children, including 12 children aged under two years. At the time of this ERO review there were 57 children on the roll including 12 children under two years old, 19 who are identified as Māori and a number of children from other ethnic groups.</p><p>The centre is set in spacious and attractive grounds. Recent and well-designed upgrades to the indoor and outdoor environments have enhanced learning spaces for children and teachers. While there are separate, age-based areas these are open and accessible for all children to use with appropriate supervision.</p><p>The centre came under the governance umbrella of Kidicorp Ltd in 2012. The Hamilton regional office of Kidicorp Ltd was established in 2012 and provides strong and effective governance, leadership and management support underpinned by Kidicorp’s clear vision and values. They undertake well-developed and rigorous self-review and quality assurance processes, as well as providing professional, administrative and business support by well-qualified and experienced personnel.</p><p>The recently appointed, well-qualified professional services manager works in a constructive partnership with the knowledgeable business manager, experienced centre manager and established teaching team. Together they have made many improvements to the areas for improvement identified in the 2011 ERO report related to improving the quality of the programme, teaching interactions and self review.</p><p>The centre philosophy gives priority to children becoming confident, competent lifelong learners secure in their sense of belonging. This philosophy is highly evident in the centre programme and operations.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are welcomed in to a warm and homely environment. They demonstrate high levels of belonging and confidence. Many families have long-standing, trusting relationships with the centre and the teaching team.</p><p>Children enjoy freedom to visit all the age-based areas in the centre and demonstrate competent and positive social skills together. Older children take care of and include younger children as they learn and play together. They model respect for centre routines, equipment and one another. ERO observed many examples of children taking responsibility for their own learning, and self-management skills.</p><p>Concepts of literacy and mathematics are well integrated into programmes and interactions across the centre. Children are learning in ways that value their creativity and self expression. This was particularly evident in the Tui room where children are able to explore and experiment with more complex equipment. The teacher in this room extends children’s thinking and makes good use of research to build their understanding of the wider world. Some children model the use of open questioning and seek the opinions of their peers as a result of teacher modelling and interactions.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are cared for in a calm and unhurried atmosphere with a skilful and experienced teacher. Children’s personal preferences and interests are well known and respectfully followed as an integral part of their learning and care. Parents spoken to valued the close, trusting and reciprocal relationships with teachers that contribute to a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing.</p><p>Transitions are well planned and managed at children’s own pace. This planned approach results in children understanding the expectations that adults have of them and enables them to participate in and contribute to the life of the centre.</p><p>There is a clear and useful planning framework. Children’s participation in the programme is richly reflected in children’s portfolios and artistic displays throughout the centre. This enables children and their families to share in successes and revisit learning together.</p><p>The centre environment reflects the value placed on Māori culture and links with Te Arawa. This is evident in the natural resources, displays, artefacts and the centre whare. Teachers and children take pride in sharing their pepeha, and tikanga Māori practices that they know and share together throughout the day.</p><p>The programme is enhanced with trips and excursions into the wider community and extends children’s understanding of places of local interest.</p><p>The highly collegial and professional teaching team bring a wide range of experience and knowledge to their roles. They are committed to their community and demonstrate high levels of trust and respect for one another, children and their families. Teachers recognise and respond to children’s individual preferences and interests.</p><p>During the review ERO observed examples of high-quality teaching practice. Particular strengths are the way teachers:</p><ul>
<li>make good use of action research and reflections to build their practice</li>
<li>promote sensitive, positive and meaningful relationships</li>
<li>take time to carefully listen to children and explore the deeper meanings in their learning</li>
<li>encourage co-construction of learning with children</li>
<li>engage in humour and laughter with children as part of the learning process.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers and children are benefitting from the knowledge and experience of a kaiāwhina. She is supporting them to develop confidence in the use of te reo Māori and in celebrating waiata, Matariki and stories of significance to Te Arawa.</p><p>The centre manager is providing highly effective leadership for centre operations and management. She develops open, transparent relationships with all stakeholders with a focus on achieving best outcomes for all children. Particular strengths of her leadership are:</p><ul>
<li>fostering emergent leadership amongst teachers</li>
<li>sharing her knowledge and experience with parents and whānau</li>
<li>modelling best practice for leadership and teaching</li>
<li>providing professional development to build the knowledge of other centres in the Kidicorp community.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that next steps for development are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation processes to include children’s individual cultures and identity and the aspirations of parents and whānau</li>
<li>evaluate the effectiveness of the planning cycle both during and at the end of planning to better identify the strengths and next steps for this process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Hillcrest completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Hillcrest will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>17 December 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
