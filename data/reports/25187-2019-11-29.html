</table><p>Kiwi Supertots Learning Centre - Papakura is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiwi Supertots Learning Centre - Papakura is a well-established centre that operates out of a remodelled house in residential Papakura. It is licensed for 35 children, including 15 up to the age of two years. The centre’s philosophy has family at the heart of achieving positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre is divided into three separate areas for babies, toddlers and preschool children. They all have access to a large, shared outdoor play area.</p><p>The owners and area manager oversee the centre with two associate supervisors responsible for the day-to-day operating. There have been many new teachers employed since the 2016 ERO review. The teaching team consists of four registered and three unqualified teachers. Staff reflect the cultural diversity of the community.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report identified areas of good practice, many of which have been maintained, including extending children's oral language and integrating te reo Māori. Some of the areas identified for ongoing improvement have been addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are respected and cared for in the inclusive environment. They happily participate in teacher-led activities and have opportunities to choose their own play. Children's home languages and backgrounds are valued. Teachers know children well and build positive and supportive relationships with families. Children up to the age of two years are sensitively nurtured and their needs closely monitored and addressed.</p><p>Teachers carefully plan ways to extend children’s collective interests through project-based activities. They are committed to enhancing children’s knowledge and skills. There are examples of practice where children’s individual interests are identified and enhanced. This good practice should be shared across the centre. Teachers would benefit from external professional learning and development (PLD) on ways to promote children’s individual interests and dispositions, and to record children's progress over their time at the centre. Teachers could also evaluate the effectiveness of the transition-to-school programme in relation to positive outcomes for children identified in <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Teachers have a collective commitment to increasing children's awareness of the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. Te reo Māori and some aspects of tikanga Māori are integrated into the daily programme. Children have visited the local marae to build their knowledge of local history. They also participate in activities that build their knowledge of Pacific languages. Children with Pacific heritage are warmly greeted in their home languages.</p><p>Portfolios of children’s learning are attractive and show how each child's learning links to the strands of <em>Te Whāriki</em>. Online learning stories show children’s participation in activities and include teachers' suggestions about ways in which these activities could be expanded. Teachers meet regularly with parents to discuss their aspirations for their children. However, it is not clear in portfolios how well children are progressing towards these aspirations or progressing with skills, knowledge, attitudes or dispositions.</p><p>The owners have implemented many useful systems and processes to ensure the centre meets regulatory requirements. They have implemented appropriate strategies to ensure teachers are well inducted into the centre. They have now developed a useful template to guide internal evaluation processes. Although the focuses and outcomes of internal evaluation differ between rooms, the focus of all the evaluations should be on positive outcomes for children.</p><p>A five-year strategic plan guides the direction of the centre. Ongoing centre improvement could be strengthened through stronger alignment between the short and long-term goals, and the centre's vision. Centre goals could be more easily evaluated if they were specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and timely.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owners, area manager and associate supervisor agree that their key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen learning outcomes for children by purposefully fostering each child’s individual learning pathway</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance internal evaluation systems to more specifically promote improved outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiwi Supertots Learning Centre - Papakura completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>29 November 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
