<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Montessori @ St Albans was opened in February 2010. This is its first ERO review. The centre is part of the Kidicorp group of centres, and caters for children from infants to six years old. The centre has a significant multicultural community.</p><p>The centre was affected by the Canterbury earthquakes of 2010 and 2011. The centre closed for two weeks due to interruptions to services in the area. The buildings and facilities suffered limited damage, and the centre&rsquo;s emergency procedures worked well. The centre&rsquo;s roll has fluctuated over the last year as families move in and out of the community. The centre manager and teachers have supported the well-being of children and their families during this time. There has been a growth in the roll in 2012.</p><p>The programme is firmly based on the Montessori philosophy. Teachers effectively integrate Te Wh&#257;riki, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum, with the Montessori approach. Parents are kept well informed about their child&rsquo;s development, routines and well-being. Teachers make good use of information that parents provide to help them ensure a secure environment for children.</p><p>Other positive features of this centre include:</p><ul>
<li>respectful and cooperative relationships between children and teachers</li>
<li>how teachers use resources and equipment to respond to children&rsquo;s interests</li>
<li>the use of self review to identify ways to improve teaching and learning</li>
<li>the way teachers plan for individual children&rsquo;s learning needs.</li>
</ul><p>The centre has undergone a significant period of change and development since opening, including staffing changes. Some key leadership appointments have been made early in 2012. The business and professional services managers are providing good support and guidance to centre managers and staff during this period of the centre&rsquo;s development.</p><p>The next steps for the centre&rsquo;s development include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to build a shared understanding about planning and assessment</li>
<li>developing teachers&rsquo; skills and knowledge regarding M&#257;ori culture and identity.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Montessori @ St Albans was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atMontessori @ St Albans.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><p>Background</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy is based on the Montessori approach to children&rsquo;s learning and development. The philosophy emphasises nurturing and celebrating every child and inspiring them towards life-long learning. Respect for the child is a primary principle of Montessori education. Children are encouraged to develop independence and to take responsibility for their learning. The environment is planned and resourced to support this Montessori approach to learning and development. Links are also made to values within M&#257;ori culture.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><em>Relationships.</em> Children benefit from respectful and supportive relationships with their teachers. Teachers focus on:</p><ul>
<li>warmly welcoming parents into the centre</li>
<li>nurturing and encouraging children</li>
<li>fostering children&rsquo;s sense of well-being and belonging</li>
<li>building team work and communication among staff.</li>
</ul><p><em>Learning environment.</em> Children are provided with a well-planned, purposefully designed learning environment. The various areas provide children with:</p><ul>
<li>activities that support the Montessori priorities for learning.</li>
<li>a good range of physical play experiences</li>
<li>access to a wide variety of activities and resources</li>
<li>opportunities to learn about science, the natural world and the arts.</li>
</ul><p><em>Learning programme.</em> Teachers actively respond to children&rsquo;s emerging interests within the programme. They consistently develop children&rsquo;s independence and self-management skills. This includes responsibilities at meal times and for putting away the equipment they use. Children have a range of choices in programme so they can pursue their interests. Literacy and numeracy are well integrated into the programme.</p><p><em>Partnerships for learning.</em> Teachers are building positive learning partnerships with parents. They provide progress reports on children&rsquo;s learning and development towards the end of the year, and meet parents twice during the year to discuss their child&rsquo;s development. Parent information evenings inform parents about the programme, and managers also seek parents&rsquo; views about the centre and the programme.</p><p><em>Planning and assessment.</em> Teachers are recognising and planning well for children&rsquo;s developing interests. They maintain a good focus on individual learning and progress. Teachers are making clear links between the Montessori philosophy and <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>. Managers and teachers have identified that they now need to:</p><ul>
<li>plan for and evaluate the key teaching practices they use to support children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>identify in assessments, the ways children are learning</li>
<li>develop a transition-to-school programme.</li>
</ul><p><em>Using self review.</em> The centre manager and teachers have begun to make good use of various forms of self review to develop and improve programmes and practices.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

<li>continuing to build a shared understanding about planning and assessment</li>
<li>developing teachers&rsquo; skills and knowledge regarding M&#257;ori culture and identity.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
