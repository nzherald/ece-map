</table><p>Kereru Rudolf Steiner Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kereru Rudolf Steiner Kindergarten is one of two kindergartens in Hawke’s Bay, affiliated to Taikura Rudolf Steiner School, Hastings. The kindergarten has 40 children from the ages of three to six years old attending and six identify as Māori.</p><p>Rudolf Steiner philosophy underpins the programme and learning environment.</p><p>Four qualified teachers implement the curriculum. The senior teacher has operational oversight of the kindergarten, with the head teacher responsible for the day-to-day running of the service. A newly developed teaching team started at the beginning of 2019.</p><p>Since the September 2016 ERO report, the governance and management structure has been reviewed and is currently being put into effect. A memorandum of understanding with the board of trustees currently guides developments.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children develop a strong sense of belonging within a respectful and nurturing environment. Teachers and children work harmoniously as they participate in their daily work. Children benefit from a calm, settled environment. The Steiner/Waldorf philosophy is highly evident in practice.</p><p>Children's self-directed exploration and engagement in play is fostered through the provision of flexible learning spaces and open-ended resources. Respectful social interactions between children and adults are evident. A range of opportunities for parents and whānau to contribute to their children's learning has increased participation within the centre and wider Steiner community.</p><p>Teachers engage in professional learning and development to strengthen their understanding and use of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori. Familiar rituals and routines aligned to the Steiner philosophy and <em>Te Whāriki</em>, provide meaningful opportunities for children to explore aspects of te ao Māori. The service works alongside whānau Māori to develop a responsive curriculum.</p><p>Effective transition practice promotes the positive inclusion of children, parents and whānau. Appropriate information is gathered to reflect parent aspirations and inform individual goals. Transition to school is well considered. An extra support teacher, based at the school, works in partnership with kindergarten staff and parents to enable seamless transition.</p><p>Children’s participation in a wide range of activities throughout their learning journey is reflected in photo albums. Teachers work collaboratively to provide a programme that is holistically responsive. Leaders and teachers have identified that continuing to further refine and strengthen the assessment and planning process is a next step.</p><p>The service works in consultation with parents and external agencies to provide appropriate learning support for those children who require this.</p><p>Recent review has made clear the roles and responsibilities for leaders, teachers and trustees. This ensures that priorities for, and operational management of, the kindergarten appropriately supports ongoing development. The use of specific strategies is lifting the profile and importance of early childhood education within the Taikura Rudolf Steiner learning community.</p><p>Strategic and annual planning are aligned to the school and kindergarten mission and valued outcomes. A shared understanding of internal evaluation processes and practices is developing and contributing to decision making for improvement. Further developing the use of evaluation should support leaders and teachers to monitor progress overtime and evaluate the impact of initiatives and practices in terms of outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the service's key next steps are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation to more clearly show children's learning over time and how their interests are extended</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation to know effectiveness of practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kereru Rudolf Steiner Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice in the area of compliance, the service should ensure that heavy objects that could fall in an earthquake are secured in adult working areas.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>1 July 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
