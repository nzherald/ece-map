<a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2>
<p><strong>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</strong></p>
<p>Topkids Lytton is developing its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children. Following significant changes in leadership, management, staffing and structure, appropriate support from Kidicorp has been put in place to help staff to identify and make necessary improvements to the education and care provided for children.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Topkids Lytton was established in 2009 and is owned by Kidicorp Limited. The centre is located in the Gisborne suburb of Te Hapara and caters for children from three months to school entry. The large centre previously operated as three centres, each with its own licence. In October 2011 the centres merged under one licence.</p>
<p>The service uses equity funding to partially fund a van service to transport children who might not otherwise attend the centre.</p>
<p>Children are catered for in three separate learning areas, Pikopiko, Tākaro and Ākonga, each team led by a head teacher. The centre manager, appointed in 2011, reports to the company's business manager and is well-supported by her and the professional services manager.</p>
<p>At the time of this ERO review, several teachers were newly appointed or relieving staff. Senior leaders and the centre manager have processes in place to address recruitment and retention of staff. This is the centre’s first ERO review.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Teaching and learning programmes reflect the current centre philosophy of respect for children’s wellbeing and individuality. Teachers in each of the three learning areas are developing their area-specific philosophies in consultation with parents and whānau.</p>
<ul><li>ERO and managers agree that it is timely to review the over-riding centre philosophy so that it connects the three areas, incorporates their individual philosophies and better reflects the aspirations of parents and whānau.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers demonstrate positive, gentle and nurturing interactions with children. They are developing their practices to respond more effectively to the interests and strengths of children. Teachers help children to develop their independence and social skills.</p>
<p>The importance of play as a vehicle for learning is promoted. A variety of areas of play support children’s creativity, physical development and exploration. Children have many opportunities for choice in their learning and, through flexible routines, teachers support them to sustain their play. The learning environments have been a focus for review and development. Teachers have found ways to make them more stimulating so that they foster and reflect children’s learning.</p>
<p>Teachers maintain a calm, slow pace in the infant and toddlers’ area, ensuring space and time for younger children to lead their learning. A responsive care-giving approach supports children's need for strong and secure attachments. Systems and routines are well organised within the spacious environment.</p>
<p>High levels of guidance and support are provided to leaders and teachers from Kidicorp professional services and business managers. They affirm areas of strength and support the centre manager and teachers to address areas for development. A clear, useful strategic plan is informed by needs recognised from audits, evaluation and appraisals. The centre manager is an experienced teacher who demonstrates good knowledge and understanding about early childhood education. She and the senior leadership team are clearly committed to promoting ongoing improvements for children. The staff appraisal model provides a sound framework to develop the skills and confidence of teachers.</p>
<p>Effective evaluation, planning and professional development is provided to managers, team leaders and teachers by the senior leadership team. This is leading to some improvements in practices and processes. Most of the areas for development identified by ERO’s external evaluation have already been recognised by the senior leadership team.</p>
<p>Managers and ERO agree that further development is needed in the following areas:</p>
<ul><li>assessment and planning practices</li>
<li>improved documentation with regard to team meetings and guidelines for teaching</li>
<li>management of transitions for children, particularly within the centre and transition to school</li>
<li>increased engagement and two-way partnership with parents, whānau and aiga so that their aspirations can be heard and responded to, in support of children’s learning</li>
<li>further strategies that promote both bicultural practices and positive outcomes for Māori children</li>
<li>further reflection of the different cultures of children in the programme, assessment and environment.</li>
</ul><p>Self review is beginning to be used to lead to improvements in the quality of education and care. Managers are aware this area needs ongoing support to ensure robust, high-quality evaluation occurs.</p>
<a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Topkids Lytton completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<ol><li>The service is not meeting the equity funding reporting requirements. In order to address this, the service provider must report to parents and the local community about how they have spent their equity funding.</li>
</ol><p>Reporting must include:</p>
<ul><li>an outline of the amount received under each Equity Funding component</li>
<li>a brief description of the purpose to which the funding was applied</li>
<li>a brief outline of the reasons for spending the funding in that way</li>
</ul><p>The report must be included in the service’s annual report for presentation at its annual general meeting.</p>

<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>Review focus</h3>
<p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p>
<ul><li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>

<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p>
