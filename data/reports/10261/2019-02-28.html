</table><p>Kidd Inn Early Learning Centre Ltd is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidd Inn Early Learning Centre offers education and care for up to 85 children, including up to 24 children under two years of age. It uses three buildings to cater for the different age groups. The buildings are interlinked through the outdoor environment, giving children ready access to outdoor areas.</p><p>The centre is privately owned and managed. It is one of three centres owned by the same company in West Auckland. The owner/manager oversees the daily management of the centre. Two head teachers have responsibility for children's care routines and learning programmes. The teaching team is well established, with low staff turnover.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is underpinned by five core values. These are peaceful and respectful communication, loving and homely environments, play as a base for learning, collaboration, and nature-based learning. Centre approaches are also strongly grounded in <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The centre has a positive ERO reporting history.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Kidd Inn Early Learning Centre provides high quality education and care for children. Children are highly engaged in learning, and are well supported to be confident and competent learners. They persist with their interests, and enjoy long periods of sustained and complex play. Children have extensive opportunities to investigate, initiate their own learning, and be imaginative and creative.</p><p>Children are well supported to grow their social competence. They negotiate with their peers, are respectful and play collaboratively. They confidently initiate conversations and ask questions. As a result, children successfully interact and support each other's play.</p><p>Children's interests form the basis of teachers' programme planning, assessment and evaluation. Planning approaches focus on children's individual plans for learning, and pay special attention to learning outcomes. Opportunities for families to contribute to the planning, assessment and evaluation stages are increasing.</p><p>Teachers recognise and cater for the growth and development stages of the different age groups. Infants receive high quality care and nurturing that promotes their strong sense of belonging. Toddlers have many opportunities to explore the environment, and develop their coordination and language skills. Older children enjoy regular additional learning experiences in the wider community. Children have daily opportunities to develop early skills in literacy and mathematics that are carefully integrated into their play.</p><p>The physical environment supports children's learning and wellbeing. The outdoor areas are enriched in nature, and the indoor spaces provide a homely and nurturing atmosphere.</p><p>The centre's professional learning has contributed to greater visibility of bicultural practices in the programme. Teachers have a stronger awareness of children's languages and cultures, and they incorporate these aspects in programmes for individual children.</p><p>Teachers have respectful learning relationships with children. They actively listen to children, and are unhurried when working with them. Teachers encourage children to take risks, accept challenges and try new experiences. Teachers are well supported to build their professional practice. Appraisal approaches continue to grow opportunities for teachers to be critical, reflective inquirers into their teaching practice.</p><p>Highly capable, professional leadership guides the realisation of centre values. Leaders model peaceful and respectful relationships, and promote collaborative ownership of centre decisions. The centre has very good systems and processes for curriculum, personnel and health and safety management.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers have a very good understanding of internal evaluation. They use it well as a catalyst for ongoing improvement. High quality evaluative practice is evident in the way leaders and teachers use the evaluation process to promote deep thinking, and encourage further learning based on research and evidence. Evaluation practices are systematic and include a focus on all aspects of the service's operations over time.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders are appropriately planning to enrich the centre's curriculum through further exploration of bicultural practices, and deepening partnerships with parents and whānau. Developing ways that encourage families to share their cultural strengths and contribute to the planning processes, should further support children to enjoy a curriculum that celebrates learning through their languages and cultures.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidd Inn Early Learning Centre Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>28 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
