</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Knox Street Kindergarten provides all day education and care for up to 30 children aged from two to five years of age. It operates for six hours, Monday to Thursday and four hours and fifteen minutes on a Friday. The recently formed teaching team is supported by a teacher aide. Teachers are experienced and fully qualified.</p><p>Over the past three years, Gisborne Kindergarten Association (the association) has provided professional support for teachers focusing on assessment, planning and evaluation. Developments to the building have recently occurred. A parent committee supports the kindergarten.</p><p>The philosophy is underpinned by Kaupapa Māori concepts and is highly evident in teaching practice and the curriculum. The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the association. Two senior teachers are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers. This review was part of a cluster of six kindergartens in the Gisborne Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers have an understanding of each child as a unique learner within the context of their whānau. They recognise that language, culture and identity are key to the development of a sense of self, belonging and connectedness. Strong respectful partnerships are formed with families. Te ao Māori is respectfully valued by teachers. There are many opportunities for whānau involvement. Warm and welcoming relationships are highly evident between children and teachers.</p><p>Children problem-solve, experiment and follow their interests. Teachers are intentional in the ways they engage children and extend learning. Teachers include children in meaningful conversations.</p><p>Parents, whānau and teachers work together to decide on significant and relevant learning outcomes for each child. Teachers incorporate these into the assessment and planning process. They work collaboratively and responsively to support children’s learning goals. Group planning processes are clear and useful for teachers.</p><p>Assessment practices help to build children’s identities as successful learners. Learning journals give useful information to parents about progress. Teachers are beginning to consider how children can be involved in self assessment.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported to learn happily and successfully. Where appropriate, teachers liaise with external agencies. All children have fun as part of learning and teachers value the importance of children learning through play.</p><p>The head teacher provides effective collaborative leadership. Use of and confidence in self review is growing and results in improvements to practice and programmes.</p><p>A high level of commitment to bicultural practice is evident and is well embedded in the programme. Te reo Māori is used naturally within the programme and is recognised as a living language by teachers and children. The programme is underpinned by the philosophy and <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Transition-to- school processes are currently being reviewed. Leaders have identified that they are developing relationships with schools and will continue to strengthen this process. ERO affirm this direction.</p><p>The association provides high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>robust guiding documents and comprehensive policies</li>
<li>clear expectations for programme delivery and kindergarten operations including health and safety practices</li>
<li>strong leadership</li>
<li>professional learning and development for staff</li>
<li>sound supporting processes for provisionally registered teachers.</li>
</ul><p>Senior teachers should undertake strategic review and evaluation across the association and use this information to inform decision making. They should also support teachers to build their evaluative capacity to regularly enquire into the effectiveness of their practice to further improve positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The association has identified that the implementation of the appraisal process requires review. ERO agrees with this direction.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers, leaders and ERO agree that teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>continue to build their evaluative capacity.</li>
</ul><p>The association's key next steps should include:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing the implementation of the appraisal process</li>
<li>undertaking formal strategic self review at association level.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Knox Street Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Knox Street Kindergarten will be in four years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><p>26 June 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
