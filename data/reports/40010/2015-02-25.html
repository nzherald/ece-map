</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tauriko Playcentre is a well-established, parent-led early childhood service. It is located adjacent to the local primary school on the outskirts of Tauranga. It provides sessional education, three days a week, for children from birth to school age in a mixed-age setting. The centre also hosts an initiative to support mothers and babies, Supporting Parents Alongside Children’s Education (SPACE), for two sessions each week.</p><p>Due to significant roll growth since the previous ERO review in 2012, the Ministry of Education has increased the centre licence to cater for up to 30 children, including 15 children under the age of two years at any one time. At the time of this ERO review there were 63 children, including three children who are identified as Māori.</p><p>Tauriko Playcentre operates under the umbrella of the Western Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association (WBOPPA). Centre members benefit from the support and guidance of an experienced centre liaison officer and a centre administration officer provided by the association. WBOPPA also provide training workshops and useful documentation and frameworks to guide centre operations. These guidelines are underpinned by the association’s philosophy, which is highly evident in members’ practice.</p><p>Members take responsibility to fulfil a number of key roles to ensure centre operation is sustainable and effective.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report identified areas for improvement about strengthening members’ use of te reo Māori and raising the quality of aspects of assessment. Good progress has been made with developing and implementing systems and processes that contribute to a manageable and consistent approach to assessment. Centre members continue to undertake training and course work that builds their confidence in the use of te reo Māori.</p><p>The centre is well maintained and attractively presented in spacious grounds with mature trees. Recent developments to the outdoor area have led to improvements, including initiatives to involve children in activities such as gardening, tree planting and growing vegetables.</p><p>Centre members embrace the playcentre philosophy and highly value parents as the first and best educators of their children. They place priority on child-initiated play and supporting children to follow their interests and build on their strengths.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six playcentres in the Western Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Experienced centre leaders are providing highly-effective leadership that promotes positive outcomes for children and their families. Self review is well understood by key people in the centre and leads to ongoing improvements and development. Effective review is evident in the way centre leaders reflect on their partnership with the community. This process resulted in a significant increase in membership and participation in parent training and course work. Experienced members model good practice and support new members who transition into the centre. They frequently reflect on the quality of children’s learning, share ideas, and use their strengths to enhance outcomes for children and their families.</p><p>Centre leaders have established systems and processes that respond to the educational needs of children, promote emergent leadership amongst adults, and ensure the sustainability of the service. They have established a centre culture which holds high expectations for parent contribution and leadership. Parent participation and success in course work and training is celebrated. This has resulted in a high percentage of well-qualified parents. Parents expressed appreciation for the partnership and empowerment they share, and the progress they have made in developing a collaborative learning community of adults and children.</p><p>Children under two years of age demonstrate high levels of wellbeing and belonging. They benefit from supportive and nurturing adults who know them well and foster their confidence as competent learners. Older children include their younger peers and siblings in their play and act as important role models for them.</p><p>Older children make wide use of the extensive range of high-quality materials and equipment to engage and sustain their play. Many children know one another well and are highly cooperative in their play and decision making. They enter confidently into imaginative play, take roles in dramatic play, and enjoy the many opportunities to express themselves creatively. Appropriate physical challenge is provided and children are able to take risks, and build their physical skills and competence in a closely monitored environment.</p><p>Centre members consistently make use of:</p><ul>
<li>open questions that promote children’s thinking and problem solving skills</li>
<li>affirmation of children’s success and learning</li>
<li>conversations that extend children’s ideas and knowledge of the wider world</li>
<li>opportunities to include children in the meaningful work of the centre</li>
<li>recognising and responding to children’s identified interests and needs.</li>
</ul><p>Adults take every opportunity to work alongside children to negotiate, co-construct and empower them in the learning process. They expressed their appreciation for the support provided by a skilled life member who is employed to plan and implement learning experiences for children.</p><p>The environment is attractive, stimulating and thoughtfully planned. It enables children to make choices, explore and experiment through play. Children are independent, self managing and competent. Mathematical and literacy learning is integrated and embedded into children’s play. However, because of the differing levels of understanding that members have of mathematical learning, a more intentional approach to reviewing this area of the curriculum would be likely to lead to greater consistency for children.</p><p>A particular strength of the programme is the way parents contribute their knowledge, plan to share their occupations and visit each others’ homes to enrich the curriculum. This includes learning about science, visits to the wider community, the involvement of fathers and celebration of cultures of the world. Children experience continuity in their learning between home and the centre through the shared approach of parent contributions.</p><p>Aspects of Māori culture are included in many areas of the centre. This was evident through some use of basic te reo Māori, inclusion of karakia kai, waiata, displays and equipment that reflect Māori values. A tradition in the centre is to celebrate Matariki and share a hangi with the wider community. Members have opportunities to build their understanding of biculturalism through WBOPPA course training.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that there is a need to continue to increase members’ knowledge and appreciation of places of local significance and the history of the area from a Māori perspective.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tauriko Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tauriko Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>25 February 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
