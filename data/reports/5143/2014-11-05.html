</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Grandview Kindergarten is located in Hamilton and provides both all-day and sessional education and care for children from two years to school age. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 40 children over the age of two years at any one time. At the time of this ERO review, 47children were enrolled, of whom 23 are identified as Māori. Most of these Māori children whakapapa to Tainui.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable trust, and does not operate for profit. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement, ‘Every child reaching their full potential’. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. All WKA kindergartens provide an <em>Enviroschool</em>s focus as a key curriculum feature to encourage children to better understand caring for the environment.</p><p>The Educational Service Manager (ESM) monitors and reports to the association on the kindergarten’s quality of education. A kaumātua from Tainui provides advice, guidance and support about Māori language, culture and identity. The kindergarten’s administrative responsibilities are well supported by association resource personnel.</p><p>The kindergarten benefits from the WKA's clear guidelines and expectations for practice and the availability of good self-review processes for monitoring and evaluating the quality of education and care it provides for children.</p><p>The kindergarten has a positive ERO reporting history. Teachers have positively addressed the area for development identified in the previous ERO report about enhancing opportunities for parents/whānau to contribute to children’s learning. Developments have also included introducing <em>Enviroschool</em>s that supports children to connect with and develop an understanding of the natural world, as well as care and respect for themselves, others and the environment.</p><p>Teachers have established a shared vision for education and care based on developing a strong partnership with parents/whānau and promoting children’s sense of wellbeing and belonging. Teachers provide a programme where children can explore, make decisions, take risks, extend their thinking and become confident and competent communicators and learners.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 12 kindergarten reviews in the Waikato Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Grandview Kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers have established respectful and trusting relationships with children and their families. Teachers are highly responsive to children’s emotional wellbeing and nurture their self esteem. Children and their families have a strong sense of belonging to the kindergarten and this supports a positive climate for learning.</p><p>A particular strength of the kindergarten is the <em>Enviroschools</em> programme that is skilfully interwoven throughout the curriculum. Teachers have successfully built a community of learners where the knowledge of respect and care for the living world forms a valuable part of interactions between kindergarten and home.</p><p>Children experience an inclusive high-quality learning environment that provides them with many challenges and caters for their diverse interests and abilities. There are considerable opportunities for children to engage in sustained and complex learning. Children are consistently inspired and encouraged to try new things and are developing confidence to take on new challenges.</p><p>Children learn in meaningful contexts. Teachers value and affirm children’s culture, language and identity. Literacy, mathematics, science and the arts are skilfully integrated into children’s play and learning experiences. Children confidently use computer technology as a tool for learning and to research new information.</p><p>Children experience success in their learning through high-quality teaching interactions. Examples of these practices include:</p><ul>
<li>learning conversations that extend children’s thinking and encourage them to inquire and research concepts and topics</li>
<li>ongoing positive affirmation of children’s efforts and contributions</li>
<li>the use of effective positive guidance strategies to support children’s social development and communication skills.</li>
</ul><p>Children have established many close friendships and support one another in their learning. This provides them with opportunities to share ideas, negotiate and take on others points of view.</p><p>Families are made to feel welcome and invited to contribute to the learning programme through sharing their skills such as poi, flax weaving and making traditional foods. Teachers have accessed external support through the expertise of kapa haka tutors who work alongside children and teachers once a week enhancing bicultural practices within the kindergarten. Parents are kept well informed about their child’s learning and progress through regular discussions with teachers and individual portfolios. These portfolios are viewed and accessed by children and their families.</p><p>The knowledgeable head teacher provides sound professional leadership for the kindergarten and is well supported by an experienced teaching team. Kindergarten staff are well respected by families and the association. Teachers have ongoing access to professional development that keeps them up-to-date with recommended best practice in early childhood education. Highly effective self-review practices are resulting in ongoing improvement and positive outcomes for children and their families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO supports the teaching team’s annual goal to further enhance the <em>Enviroschools</em> programme by:</p><ul>
<li>increasing Māori ways of knowing</li>
<li>deepening the strong partnerships and encouraging more participation by parents/whānau in the learning programme.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Grandview Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Grandview Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>5 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
