</table><p>Gate Pa Preschool and Childcare <span>is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</span></p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Gate Pa Preschool and Childcare is a privately-owned centre located in Gate Pa, Tauranga. The centre provides all-day education and care in a mixed-age setting for children up to the age of six years. The centre roll is licensed for 30 children with 10 up to the age of two. The current roll is 39 children 12 of whom identify as Māori. The teaching team includes the owner/manager, 2IC and team leader. Over 80% of teachers are qualified.</p><p>The centre philosophy emphasises respect “for ourselves; each other; children and whanau; and the environment”. They believe that nurturing relationships are vital, and the uniqueness of each age is acknowledged in teaching practices. The service's philosophy, vision, and mission statement are embedded in the life of the centre.</p><p>Management have responded well to the key next steps identified in the 2015 ERO review related to the use of self-review and maintaining high trust relationships. Staff have recently completed a two-year research project based around effective dialogues for two-year-olds in a mixed-age setting.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Infants, toddlers and young children experience positive and affirming interactions with their teachers. Teachers are responsive to children’s feelings, interests and ideas. They use a range of effective strategies to notice, recognise and respond to children’s play and exploration. Children demonstrate trust in adults and have confidence to contribute and cooperate as a member of a group. In the context of play children are well supported by teachers to enjoy books, verbally express their ideas, and use maths concepts and numbers for increasingly complex purposes.</p><p>The well-planned curriculum effectively promotes positive learning outcomes for all children. Areas of play are well resourced, and children are empowered to engage in sustained and uninterrupted play and learning. Teachers integrate aspects of te reo and tikanga Māori into the daily programme and a range of resources supports this integration and affirms Māori children in their language culture and identity. A high level of parent whānau participation contributes to children's sense of belonging and confidence that they and their families are valued. Children benefit from many opportunities to follow their interests and experience challenging learning activities.</p><p>Babies and toddlers in the under-two room benefit from routines that are highly responsive to individual preferences and needs. There is a calm and settled pace that gives children time and space to lead their own learning in a rich curriculum. Tuakana/teina relationships provide opportunities for children to talk, play and build relationships with each other. A well-considered and inclusive approach supports children and their whānau with additional needs. Teachers know and respond to specific learning and behaviour needs. Effective plans and strategies are developed alongside parents and external agencies to support children requiring additional support.</p><p>The centre owner/manager, supported by the second-in-command and team leader, is providing effective professional leadership. She has in-depth knowledge of the early childhood curriculum and fosters a culture of professional reflection and learning among teachers. Effective internal evaluation is contributing to ongoing improvement to the quality of education and responsiveness to centre stakeholders. Self-review is well understood and leads to evidence-based decision making. A clear vision and high expectations for the education and care for children is evident. Leaders and teachers work in partnership with parents and whānau contributing to a shared understanding and positive outcomes for children across the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre management agree that a key next step is to strengthen the consistency of individual portfolios to show learning and progress over time.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Gate Pa Preschool and Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>9 September 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
