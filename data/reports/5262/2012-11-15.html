<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Mill Street Kindergarten, Marton, is one of 25 kindergartens under the Ruahine Kindergarten Association (the association). The kindergarten caters for up to 30 children. A third of the roll is M&#257;ori and a quarter, Samoan. Children are enrolled from a wide semi-rural district. The centre has recently been relicensed.</p><p>The environment is large and spacious, especially the outdoors. A small but involved parent committee provides ongoing support for the kindergarten in a partnership role. Teachers are caring and nurturing and have positive relationships with children and their families.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in 25 early childhood education services within the Ruahine Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are warmly welcomed into the kindergarten. They freely choose their area of play and play cooperatively for sustained periods. Manaakitanga is strong. Children are encouraged to speak with each other in their home language and older children help those younger. There is a settled atmosphere.</p><p>Teachers&rsquo; interactions with children are positive, caring and purposeful. They engage in conversation with children as they play and offer support and encouragement.</p><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy is currently under review. Teachers are working towards developing parent aspirations within the children's learning stories.</p><p>Staff should develop ways to document and respond to parent aspirations as part of reviewing the philosophy. This should continue to strengthen relationships and contribute to a deeper understanding of a culturally responsive curriculum.</p><p>The curriculum prioritises:</p><ul>
<li>nurturing children and supporting families</li>
<li>developing physical skills and learning through play and fun</li>
<li>managing risk-taking to develop confidence</li>
<li>integrating opportunities for literacy and numeracy into play</li>
<li>children setting their own goals and level of challenge, supported by teachers.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers show commitment to a bicultural curriculum. This is an ongoing area of development. They are exploring ways, using internal and external expertise, to make Samoan and M&#257;ori perspectives more visible in the environment, and to furthering their cultural awareness, responsiveness and knowledge.</p><p>Planning reflects children&rsquo;s interests and dispositions.</p><p>The planning process could be strengthened by teachers better identifying ways they challenge and extend learning opportunities.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s experiences, participation and achievements are recorded in learning stories. These are generally descriptive and some show links to prior learning. Stories are beginning to include cultural recognition. Portfolio stories for older children make explicit links to the <em>New Zealand Curriculum</em>, providing useful assessment information for new entrant teachers.</p><p>The centre is inclusive in its practice. The expectation is that children with additional learning needs are included in all aspects of the programme. Staff and management are proactive about getting support for new immigrant children and their families.</p><p>Teachers share responsibilities and work as a cohesive team. Leadership is demonstrated by the strength of relationships among staff, families and community.</p><p>Teachers are improvement focused. A review of transition to school demonstrated many aspects of sound review processes with good outcomes for children and their families.</p><p>The kindergarten is well supported by the association. The association provides generous opportunities for professional development based on teacher need or interest and association goals. The provision of systems and policies, staffing, resources and property, assist teachers to focus on their teaching role. A professional services manager provides educational leadership through regular monitoring, encouragement, support and suggestions at centre and individual level.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mill Street Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select &lsquo;have&rsquo; or &lsquo;have not&rsquo; taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>15 November 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
