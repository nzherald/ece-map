</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidz Corner is situated in Ashhurst, north east of Palmerston North. The centre is licensed for 57 children including 16 aged up to two years. At the time of this review there were 78 children on roll, drawn from both rural and urban areas.</p><p>The centre provides three distinct areas accommodating different age groups, each with its own outdoor environment. Koru house, added since the 2012 Education Review, is a separate space for the up to two year olds. Kowhai house caters for children from two to three years and Kahikatea is the learning space for the older children aged up to five.</p><p>Kidz Corner has been jointly owned and operated by the current management team since 2002. The Evolve Education Group, an umbrella organisation that includes a large number of early childhood education services, will take over the ownership at the end of 2014. The current staff and leadership will continue to manage daily operation.</p><p>The February 2012 ERO report highlighted the need for the centre to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen teachers’ planning and assessment</li>
<li>further develop processes for self review</li>
<li>improve teachers’ performance management and appraisal.</li>
</ul><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Kidz Corner is welcoming and inclusive. A calm and purposeful tone is evident. Interactions between teachers and children are sensitive and responsive. Children relate respectfully to each other, cooperating and sharing learning experiences. They are confident, independent and self-managing. Teachers actively promote a sense of belonging and connection to the community.</p><p>The environment includes a wide range of natural materials and artefacts that reflect the cultural backgrounds of the children, their families and whānau. It promotes creativity, wonder and critical thinking. The variety of indoor and outdoor spaces invites enjoyable exploration. A focus on the natural world and science is clearly evident. Outdoor spaces are well considered, with moveable and fixed equipment that provides a range of physical challenges and play opportunities.</p><p>Teachers successfully respond to the individual needs of children across the different areas of the centre. Thoughtful conversations between teachers and children promote engagement. Sustained, shared teaching episodes effectively extend the complexity of children’s thinking. Teachers demonstrate practices that effectively facilitate learning in literacy. They provide meaningful contexts and resources for children to explore mathematics in everyday life.</p><p>Programmes effectively integrate te reo, tikanga and te ao Māori. Teachers and leaders show genuine commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi. They value the skills and expertise whānau bring to the centre and collaborate to develop the bicultural curriculum. Pacific families’ involvement in the curriculum is promoted, and Pacific culture and language are acknowledged and celebrated.</p><p>The centre’s curriculum links strongly to <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. The philosophy of providing a welcoming, nurturing environment with a holistic approach to children’s learning clearly underpins all aspects of centre operation.</p><p>Teachers effectively recognise and record children’s individual strengths and interests. Learning is documented and plans for extension and children’s next steps are considered. The programme has good continuity and flow. Separate whānau groups in each area are catered for through a differentiated and responsive programme. Individual care giving promotes a strong sense of connection and belonging, particularly evident in the provision for children up to two years of age. Centre leaders have identified that increasing the opportunities for children to integrate and socialise between areas needs further development.</p><p>Teachers effectively communicate children’s learning and interests with parents. Good relationships are promoted through newsletters and informal conversations. Digital online learning stories are a successful vehicle for sharing information about children’s experiences, learning and progress with parents and the wider whānau. These show links to <em>Te Whāriki</em> and how teachers will respond to children’s interests. The format provides parents with opportunities to interact and contribute their thoughts and aspirations.</p><p>Leaders encourage the involvement of parents in supporting centre improvement and shaping strategic direction. Annual planning is in place and identifies areas of focus and priority. These need to be more clearly linked to outcomes for children that can be evaluated as part of self review.</p><p>Transitions within the centre are well considered. Good relationships and effective partnerships between centre, school and parents have been established to support children to transition successfully.</p><p>Centre self-review processes lead to improvements for children. Leaders consult effectively with children, teachers and parents to include a range of perspectives. Change is well considered and managed. An appropriate range of policies and procedures is reviewed regularly.</p><p>Professional learning for teachers is shared and enacted across all learning areas. Positive changes to practice are evident as a result. Supporting teachers to build their capability is carefully considered.</p><p>Appraisal was identified in the 2012 ERO review as needing review and development. A process was begun in 2014 but not fully completed. Performance management continues to be an area that requires immediate attention.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Strategic and annual planning needs strengthening to include:</p><ul>
<li>clear and measurable goals linked to outcomes for children</li>
<li>reflection and evaluation of the centre’s progress towards achieving these goals.</li>
</ul><p>A robust and rigorous performance management process needs to be developed and fully implemented for leaders and teachers. To effectively support teachers to improve their practice, this needs to include:</p><ul>
<li>goal setting and planning</li>
<li>feedback and feed forward</li>
<li>teacher reflection on effectiveness</li>
<li>identification of individual professional learning needs</li>
<li>integration of elements from <em>Tātaiako – Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners.</em></li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidz Corner completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should develop and implement a performance management process that supports teachers to improve their teaching and assesses their practice against the Registered Teacher Criteria.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidz Corner will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>11 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
