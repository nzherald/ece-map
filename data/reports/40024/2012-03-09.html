<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p>Awakeri Playcentre operates under the umbrella of Eastern Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association. It is located near Whakatane and is a close neighbour of Awakeri School. The licence allows 25 children to attend at any one time, including up to 12 children under two years of age. Currently a total of 44 children are attending, of whom 18 are under two. Approximately one-quarter of the children are of M&#257;ori descent.</p>
<p>The centre has a record of positive reviews, and has made further progress since the last ERO review in 2008. Parents are maintaining a high level of playcentre training, and there is a strong focus on planning, assessment and self review. Professional development has enhanced members understanding of ways to extend the provision for babies and toddlers. The committed team of parents has maintained and improved the property and purchased new resources.</p>
<p>Children are playing in a rich learning environment that offers them a free choice of meaningful activities. Parents&rsquo; careful supervision supports children&rsquo;s safety and well-being, while encouraging active, sustained and challenging exploration and play. The attractively planted vegetable garden provides experiences of nature, and fruit and vegetables are harvested for healthy eating. Trips and excursions expand children&rsquo;s knowledge of the wider environment.</p>
<p>The centre&rsquo;s family-friendly setting encourages children and their parents to develop positive and respectful relationships. Children display important social skills, and responsible and caring attitudes. Parents and adults are focused on children&rsquo;s play and learning. They integrate a M&#257;ori dimension into the programme, and aspects of literacy and mathematics are also included. Children&rsquo;s participation, learning and progress is recorded in valuable individual profile books.</p>
<p>Leadership is shared, and parents participate actively in the life of the centre. They freely contribute their strengths and skills to support its objectives. Formal and informal self-review is developing and guiding centre direction. Development goals are formulated after thorough consultation, and progress towards achieving them is monitored. The centre is in a strong position to continue to provide high-quality education and care.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Awakeri Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atAwakeri Playcentre.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Awakeri Playcentre designs its programme and centre operation to reflect the philosophy of the Eastern Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association. As a family-based cooperative it caters for the varying seasonal commitments of rural families and respects the needs of individual members. The centre affirms its intention of continually improving its facilities and services for the benefit of the children&rsquo;s early childhood education.</p>
<p>The association supports the centre through its parent education and training programme and the advice and guidance provided by its officers.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p>Environment: Parents work hard to design and prepare a rich learning environment for children between birth and school age. The learning environment includes many important features such as:</p>
<ul><li>comfortable spaces that allow parents to work alongside and care for their children;</li>
<li>many well-resourced learning areas, which are continuously available and carefully adapted to children&rsquo;s interests as they change and develop;</li>
<li>an outdoor environment that has mature trees, a landscaped native garden and productive plantings of fruit and vegetables for children to enjoy; and</li>
<li>indoor and outdoor areas carefully prepared and supervised to be safe and challenging for all children attending, with considered and responsive attention given to babies and toddlers.</li>
</ul><p>Children are purposefully engaged in meaningful learning as they freely and actively play in the high-quality environment.</p>
<p>Relationships: The Awakeri Playcentre community has established and is maintaining a safe, warm and inclusive social environment for their children and families. In this family-friendly setting, parents know one another, and each other&rsquo;s children, well. This knowledge enables them to respond effectively to children&rsquo;s learning and care needs, and to support a calm, relaxed atmosphere. Children know what is expected of them and where the boundaries are. They form strong friendships, and interact responsively with babies and toddlers. Children are displaying important social skills evident in their responsible attitudes and high levels of empathy.</p>
<p>The programme in action: Parents are designing and delivering a programme that is highly effective in promoting children&rsquo;s learning and development. They demonstrate a clear understanding of the principles and philosophy that underpin the Te Wh&#257;riki curriculum, and implement it through a play-based approach. The daily programme is planned flexibly to respond to children&rsquo; emerging interests and incorporates routines that reflect children&rsquo;s needs and preferences. Children are able to play for sustained periods and return to earlier learning.</p>
<p>Children&rsquo;s learning journey is made visible in valuable and detailed individual profiles that show children&rsquo;s participation and progress during their time at playcentre.</p>
<p>Parents and adults are focused on children&rsquo;s play and consistently engage in rich and purposeful conversations. Children are developing good communication skills and show confidence that adults will support their play and protect their well-being. Care is taken to integrate a M&#257;ori dimension, and aspects of literacy and mathematics as natural parts of the programme. The playcentre is laying a sound foundation for children&rsquo;s ongoing learning.</p>
<p>Leadership and participation: Awakeri Playcentre functions as a strong parent cooperative, with responsibilities delegated among a wide group of parents. Leadership is shared, and the inclusive approach motivates parents to participate actively in the life of the centre, contributing their strengths and skills to support its objectives. Formal and informal self review is developing and guiding centre direction. Action plans are developed after thorough consultation, and progress in implementing decisions is openly monitored.</p>
<p>The centre now has a high proportion of parents who have completed playcentre courses, with a good number reaching higher levels. A variety of strategies is supporting members to sustain this level of achievement, which is making an important contribution to the quality of the learning programme for children.</p>
<h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p>Sustaining and embedding practice: The centre is in a good position to refine and embed the strategies that support the high quality programme. It operates successfully as a parent cooperative centre that reflects the core values adopted by the Eastern Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association. It is appropriate for the centre to maintain its focus on the following areas:</p>
<ul><li>nurturing the skills of parent members in administration, early childhood education, assessment and evaluation and leadership;</li>
<li>developing parents&rsquo; confidence in te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori; and</li>
<li>contributing to the work of the association.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3>
<p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul><li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
</ul><p>Although there are no children with moderate to severe special needs currently enrolled in this service, the playcentre is well-placed to provide appropriate education and care for a child with special needs and support for family members. Contributing factors are:</p>
<ul><li>the friendly, welcoming and inclusive approach of centre parents;</li>
<li>the close knowledge that parents develop about the needs and interests of each other&rsquo;s children;</li>
<li>the high levels of playcentre training among centre members; and</li>
<li>the experienced and well-informed support available from association personnel.</li>
</ul><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Awakeri Playcentre completed an ERO <span>Centre Management Assurance Statement</span> and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>

<p>To the Parents and Community of Awakeri Playcentre</p>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Awakeri Playcentre.</p>
<p>Awakeri Playcentre operates under the umbrella of Eastern Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association. It is located near Whakatane and is a close neighbour of Awakeri School. The licence allows 25 children to attend at any one time, including up to 12 children under two years of age. Currently a total of 44 children are attending, of whom 18 are under two. Approximately one-quarter of the children are of M&#257;ori descent.</p>
<p>The centre has a record of positive reviews, and has made further progress since the last ERO review in 2008. Parents are maintaining a high level of playcentre training, and there is a strong focus on planning, assessment and self review. Professional development has enhanced members understanding of ways to extend the provision for babies and toddlers. The committed team of parents has maintained and improved the property and purchased new resources.</p>
<p>Children are playing in a rich learning environment that offers them a free choice of meaningful activities. Parents&rsquo; careful supervision supports children&rsquo;s safety and well-being, while encouraging active, sustained and challenging exploration and play. The attractively planted vegetable garden provides experiences of nature, and fruit and vegetables are harvested for healthy eating. Trips and excursions expand children&rsquo;s knowledge of the wider environment.</p>
<p>The centre&rsquo;s family-friendly setting encourages children and their parents to develop positive and respectful relationships. Children display important social skills, and responsible and caring attitudes. Parents and adults are focused on children&rsquo;s play and learning. They integrate a M&#257;ori dimension into the programme, and aspects of literacy and mathematics are also included. Children&rsquo;s participation, learning and progress is recorded in valuable individual profile books.</p>
<p>Leadership is shared, and parents participate actively in the life of the centre. They freely contribute their strengths and skills to support its objectives. Formal and informal self-review is developing and guiding centre direction. Development goals are formulated after thorough consultation, and progress towards achieving them is monitored. The centre is in a strong position to continue to provide high-quality education and care.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p>
<p>National Evaluation Topics &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p>
<p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
