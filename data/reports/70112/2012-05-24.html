<p class="ReportText1stPara">Rolleston Playcentre is one of 49 operating playcentres that are administrated by the Canterbury Playcentre Association. &nbsp;The playcentre runs as a parent cooperative and is open for six sessions each week.&nbsp; A dedicated team of coordinators and the parent group are responsible for the effective day-to-day operation of the playcentre.&nbsp; They work well together to foster a learning environment that values parents as the first and best educators of their children.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The playcentre association provides a good level of support to parents to effectively operate the centre.&nbsp; This includes training to build on parents&rsquo; understanding of Te&nbsp;Wh&#257;riki, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Children benefit from warm and responsive relationships with caring adults and other children.&nbsp; They learn through play in an attractive, well presented and well resourced environment.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The centre experienced minimal damage and disruption as a result of the Canterbury earthquakes. &nbsp;The supportive and inclusive parent group welcomed a number of children and families who needed to move to the area for varying amounts of time.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Other positive features of the playcentre include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a family group setting where children of mixed ages, including siblings, can play together on the same session</li>
<li>a high number of parents are actively involved with small groups of children</li>
<li>a child focused approach where the child&rsquo;s emerging interests inform the daily programme</li>
<li>spacious outside play areas that provide a wide range of physical challenges and opportunities for children to learn about the natural world and sustainable practices.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">The playcentre association provides a specialist team, He Waka Eke Noa, to support understandings and implementation of tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori.&nbsp; The coordinators and parent group at Rolleston playcentre show a strong interest, and make visible in the environment, M&#257;ori values and concepts.&nbsp; The children have many opportunities to learn about the bicultural natural of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The coordinators and parent group have identified, and ERO agrees, that they should continue to build on and share good practices such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>strengthening the consistency of identifying children&rsquo;s learning and the next steps that adults will take to build on children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>evaluating the impact of adult interactions on the learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">Future Action</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Before the review, the management of Rolleston Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO.&nbsp; ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. &nbsp;This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atRolleston Playcentre .</p>
<p class="ReportText">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education.&nbsp; For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Background</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">The centre philosophy was recently revised to more strongly reflect the priorities of the current parent group.&nbsp; The parent group place an emphasis on welcoming, involving and valuing wh&#257;nau and parents as the first and best educators of their children.&nbsp; It states that parents will use Te Wh&#257;riki. &nbsp;Children will learn through play, make their own choices, and follow their own interests within a safe and secure environment that has rich and varied learning resources.</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Areas of strength</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">The parent group works well together to offer a learning environment for children and families that strongly reflects the centre philosophy. &nbsp;Positive and respectful relationships between children and adults and amongst children are a feature of the playcentre.&nbsp; Adults are highly responsive to children&rsquo;s individual interests.&nbsp; They work with children in ways that add value to children&rsquo;s learning.&nbsp; Tuakana teina is evident in the programme where older children care for younger children and involve and support them in their play.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The child-led programme provides children with many opportunities to make choices, and to follow and develop their own interests.&nbsp; Children benefit from rich and varied experiences and good quality resources that promote children&rsquo;s learning and involvement in activities for long periods of uninterrupted time.&nbsp; Adults actively foster children&rsquo;s independence and self help skills. &nbsp;A strong focus of the programme is the provision of creative and sensory play activities. &nbsp;Excursions into the community enhance the learning programme for children and families.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The spacious and natural outdoor areas provide many opportunities for physical play and for children to explore and make their own discoveries.&nbsp; Adults actively involve children in learning experiences that extend on their understandings of the natural world and sustainable practices.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Children&rsquo;s interests and participation in a wide range of learning experiences are well documented in attractive profile books and informative and visual wall displays.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The playcentre association provides a good level of support to parents to effectively operate the centre.&nbsp; A feature of this support is the parent education programme to develop parent understandings of Te Wh&#257;riki.&nbsp; It also includes a specialist team to support understandings and implementation of tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori.&nbsp; The coordinators and parent group at Rolleston Playcentre show a strong interest in implementing M&#257;ori values and concepts.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The coordinators and parent group make good use of effective self-review systems to support the ongoing improvement of the playcentre and positive outcomes for children and families.</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Area for development and review</h4>
<h5 class="MSHeading4">Assessment, programme planning and evaluation</h5>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">The coordinators and parent group have identified, and ERO, agrees, that they should continue to build on and share good practices such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>strengthening &nbsp;the consistency of identifying children&rsquo;s learning and the next steps that adults will take to build on children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>evaluating the impact of adult interactions on the learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul>
<a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Before the review, the staff of Rolleston Playcentre completed an ERO Centre Management Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist.&nbsp; In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures.&nbsp; ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Future Action</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children.&nbsp; Therefore, ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.&nbsp;</p>

</div><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-rolleston-playcentre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 class="CommunityPageHeader">To the Parents and Community of Rolleston Playcentre</h2><p class="ReportText1stPara">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on<br> Rolleston Playcentre .</p><p class="ReportText1stPara">Rolleston Playcentre is one of 49 operating playcentres that are administrated by the Canterbury Playcentre Association. &nbsp;The playcentre runs as a parent cooperative and is open for six sessions each week.&nbsp; A dedicated team of coordinators and the parent group are responsible for the effective day-to-day operation of the playcentre.&nbsp; They work well together to foster a learning environment that values parents as the first and best educators of their children.</p><p class="ReportText">The playcentre association provides a good level of support to parents to effectively operate the centre.&nbsp; This includes training to build on parents&rsquo; understanding of Te&nbsp;Wh&#257;riki, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum.</p><p class="ReportText">Children benefit from warm and responsive relationships with caring adults and other children.&nbsp; They learn through play in an attractive, well presented and well resourced environment.</p><p class="ReportText">The centre experienced minimal damage and disruption as a result of the Canterbury earthquakes.&nbsp; The supportive and inclusive parent group welcomed a number of children and families who needed to move to the area for varying amounts of time.</p><p class="ReportText">Other positive features of the playcentre include:</p><ul>
<li>a family group setting where children of mixed ages, including siblings, can play together on the same session</li>
<li>a high number of parents are actively involved with small groups of children</li>
<li>a child focused approach where the child&rsquo;s emerging interests inform the daily programme</li>
<li>spacious outside play areas that provide a wide range of physical challenges and opportunities for children to learn about the natural world and sustainable practices.</li>
</ul><p class="ReportText">The playcentre association provides a specialist team, He Waka Eke Noa, to support understandings and implementation of tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori.&nbsp; The coordinators and parent group at Rolleston playcentre show a strong interest, and make visible in the environment, M&#257;ori values and concepts.&nbsp; The children have many opportunities to learn about the bicultural natural of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p class="ReportText">The coordinators and parent group have identified, and ERO agrees, that they should continue to build on and share good practices such as:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening the consistency of identifying children&rsquo;s learning and the next steps that adults will take to build on children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>evaluating the impact of adult interactions on the learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3 class="MSHeading2">Future Action</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children.&nbsp; Therefore, ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p class="ReportText">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take.&nbsp; You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p class="ReportText1stPara">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.&nbsp;</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 class="MSHeading2">GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3 class="MSHeading2">About ERO</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3 class="MSHeading2">About ERO Reviews</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews.&nbsp; The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p class="ReportText">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s &nbsp;self review.</p><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Focus</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review.&nbsp; ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.<b></b></li>
</ul><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Coverage</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues.&nbsp; The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Recommendations</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement.&nbsp; A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue.&nbsp; There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
