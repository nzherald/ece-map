</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hillcrest Kindergarten is located in Hillcrest, which is an eastern suburb of Hamilton. It is situated on an attractive and thoughtfully developed site next to a spacious park and natural bush area. The kindergarten provides sessional education and care for children from over two years to school age. Morning sessions cater for 40 preschool children from Monday to Friday. Afternoon sessions on Tuesday and Thursday cater for 30 younger children. Of the 70 children enrolled at this kindergarten, four are identified as Māori.</p><p>The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO. Since the 2012 ERO report, the teaching team has remained stable. The head teacher and staff continue to welcome and effectively support children from a wide range of cultural backgrounds. The kindergarten is a hub for its diverse community. There is a strong focus on parent partnerships for learning and a purposeful, cheerful atmosphere for children, teachers and families/whānau.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable trust, and does not operate for profit. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement, ‘Every child reaching their full potential’. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. All WKA kindergartens provide an <em>Enviroschool</em> focus as a key curriculum feature to encourage children to better understand caring for the environment.</p><p>The Educational Service Manager (ESM) monitors and reports to the association on the kindergarten’s quality of education. A kaumātua from Tainui provides advice, guidance and support about Māori language, culture and identity. The kindergarten’s administrative responsibilities are well supported by association resource personnel.</p><p>The kindergarten benefits from the WKA's clear guidelines and expectations for practice and the availability of good self-review processes for monitoring and evaluating the quality of education and care it provides for children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five kindergarten reviews in the Waikato Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Hillcrest Kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Children enjoy mutually respectful relationships with teachers and each other. Teachers have high expectations for positive, considerate behaviour, which fosters a strong sense of belonging and self worth. They consistently affirm children’s culture, language and identity and work closely with parents/whānau to support children as they settle into both afternoon and morning sessions. Daily routines explicitly, yet unobtrusively, support the development of children’s self-management and social skills.</p><p>The high-quality learning environment invites children’s interest, curiosity, exploration and sustained engagement. The environment is a feature of the kindergarten and is supported throughout by high-quality resources that reflect bicultural and multicultural perspectives. Attractively presented indoor spaces include well-considered displays. They are organised to promote children’s learning through play in literacy, mathematics, science, construction, creative expression and dramatic play. The outdoor areas are carefully designed to make the best use of available space. Children have many opportunities for physical challenge, carpentry and messy play. The kindergarten’s commitment to <em>Enviroschools</em> is reflected in vegetable gardens, native plantings and recycling processes. In addition, teachers regularly use the adjoining park and bush area to extend children‘s exploration and physical skills.</p><p>Teachers have very sound professional knowledge of theory and current best practice in early childhood education. They engage children in learning conversations that promote thinking and oral language development. The programme is based on a balance of children’s observed interests and teachers’ suggestions that reflect family/whānau contexts. Parents have many opportunities to participate in the programme. They are encouraged to share and celebrate significant aspects of their culture with the rest of the kindergarten community. The kindergarten’s philosophy is woven through planning, assessment and evaluation and is continually reflected in the daily programme.</p><p>Learning is continually visible to children and families. Information and communication technologies are used effectively to enable children to record and share their learning and play. Storypark, which is a computer-based communication system, enables parents to view children’s work and to respond immediately. Parents’ and children’s comments inform ongoing planning and assessment. Teachers share daily digital updates about the programme. Assessment records demonstrate a wide range of learning experiences for children and increasingly show a progression of learning over time. There are well-established processes for facilitating transition to school, particularly for children who need additional support.</p><p>The head teacher demonstrates very well-informed and effective professional leadership. She empowers and supports teachers to work collaboratively and to successfully manage delegated leadership responsibilities. The experienced teaching team engages in professional learning and continually reflect on practices that promote positive outcomes for children. Reflection and robust self review result in a momentum of continual improvement. The team has shared goals that reflect high expectations for children’s education, parent involvement and a collaborative approach to ongoing review and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The ESM and teaching team already recognise, and ERO agrees, that areas for ongoing development include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>increase teachers’ knowledge, expertise and use of te reo and tikanga Māori in the programme</li>
<li>review and refine assessment processes</li>
<li>ensure that planned property development increases children’s access to outdoor equipment.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hillcrest Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hillcrest Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>3 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
