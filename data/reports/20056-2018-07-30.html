</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>VisionWest Christian Kindergarten in Glen Eden is overseen by the VisionWest Community Trust. The overarching vision of the trust is to see 'Transformed Lives and Healthy Communities'. The Trust provides a comprehensive range of community-based services for the local area and in the wider West Auckland community.</p><p>The kindergarten currently provides sessional and full-day early childhood education for up to 35 children over two years of age. The philosophy of the kindergarten is guided by Christian values and <em>Te</em> <em>Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. It is guided by the Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education.</p><p>A newly appointed centre manager is guided by the governance and management structure of the VisionWest Trust. She is also supported by qualified teaching staff and an administrator. The kindergarten has recently been relicensed to extend their opening hours.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report highlighted the positive difference the kindergarten was making to children's learning and development. This has been maintained.</p><p>Areas for development in the 2015 report included creating more meaningful assessment, planning and evaluation. Progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are independent and confident learners who settle quickly upon arrival. They lead the direction of their play and are encouraged to explore areas of their interest. They use their imagination and creativity in their free play indoors and outdoors. Children and whānau are warmly welcomed into the centre. Parents spoken to report teachers provide high levels of support for them and their children and good information about their children's learning and development.</p><p>Teachers endeavour to know children well and provide learning experiences that engage children's interests and build on their capabilities. Children with additional needs are well catered for and are provided with suitable learning resources and experiences. Teachers participate in regular professional discussions about children's learning and wellbeing. They write learning stories for children that reflect their interests and strengths and identify next steps to support their learning.</p><p>Children's sense of belonging is well supported. Relationships between children and adults are warm and respectful. Children contribute to a curriculum that affirms and celebrates their cultural heritage. The VisionWest Trust and kindergarten staff have a commitment to work together for continuous improvement, and to strengthen bicultural practice.</p><p>Opportunities for ongoing and appropriate professional development are available for staff. A recently established planning framework allows teachers to respond effectively to individual children's interests. They have collaboratively strengthened planning to extend and support children's learning over time.</p><p>The wider VisionWest Trust provides the kindergarten with good governance, management and administrative support. Policies and procedures are well established and continue to be developed to align with current best practice. Internal evaluation for future improvement is prioritised and aims to produce positive outcomes for children. Strategic and annual plans support the kindergarten's future direction.</p><p>Centre managers and staff work collaboratively with VisionWest Trust to build the quality of teaching and learning. They demonstrate a strong commitment to the philosophy and vision of the kindergarten to provide high quality childcare for the local community.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The management team agree the next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue strengthening curriculum planning and assessment to focus on children's individual learning dispositions, interests and capabilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and embed an inquiry-focused appraisal system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the centre philosophy and practice to align it with the 2017 version of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of VisionWest Christian Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice, the centre manager should report to parents the amount and details of the expenditure of any Ministry of Education funding received by the service.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of VisionWest Christian Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>30 July 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
