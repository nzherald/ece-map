</table><p>Talented Tots Mt Albert is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children. </p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Talented Tots Mt Albert is situated in the suburb of Mt Albert, Auckland and provides education and care for children who come from a diverse range of cultural and ethnic backgrounds. There are two children of Māori descent, and two from the Pacific Islands enrolled. The centre is licensed for 25 children over the age of two years.</p><p>This centre is one of four in Auckland owned and operated by CTA Enterprise Ltd, a family-owned company. The centre owner is the service provider, governs the centre and provides overall financial management. A group manager is employed to provide professional leadership, and support and guidance for the centre leader in all aspects of centre operation.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO, there have been changes to leadership and teaching staff. In September 2015, a teacher was promoted to the position of centre leader and an experienced teacher joined the teaching team. Management and the centre leader work in a positive and professional partnership with a focus on best outcomes for families and children. Following a review of the centre licence, the decision was made to provide education and care for children over the age of two years. This has resulted in an enhanced learning environment and programme for children and teachers. Many of the areas for development identified in the 2012 ERO report have been significantly improved.</p><p>The group manager, in her role as professional leader, has introduced a planned approach to self review. The centre leader and teachers have effectively implemented this model. The centre undertook extensive consultation with families and staff as part of the recent review of the centre philosophy, which now reflects the aspirations and values shared by teachers and families. It aims to support tamariki as happy, healthy children and promote a lifelong love of learning in a culture of kindness.</p><p>In 2015, management employed an external consultant to provide professional learning, development and support for teachers about assessment, planning and evaluation. Teachers have implemented systems and processes to integrate the learning into centre practice. This has resulted in an increased focus on children’s learning and progress over time. The programme for children is well planned, documented and responsive to their identified individual strengths and needs.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO and was one of three CTA Enterprise Ltd. centres reviewed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre leader has a good understanding of centre organisation and has established a collaborative approach to decision making amongst the teaching team. She has been well supported at all levels by the group manager and centre owner. There are regular opportunities for her to meet for professional discussions with centre leaders from other centres within the organisation.</p><p>Many families from diverse cultures are actively involved in contributing their knowledge and skills to enrich the life of the centre. They are warmly welcomed into the centre in a well-planned transition programme that is responsive to their individual preferences.</p><p>The centre environment and programme reflects the value placed on the language, culture and identity of each child. One teacher is Māori and she is building the knowledge and confidence of the teaching team to further promote success for Māori tamariki as Māori. Children for whom English is a second language are settled skilfully and sensitively by experienced teachers. There would be benefit in exploring professional learning and seeking resources to further support teachers and families through this process.</p><p>Children and aiga from Pasifika cultures make a strong contribution to the centre. They share aspects of their culture with children and teachers, particularly during celebrations such as Pasifika Festival and Samoan Language week. Teachers demonstrate enthusiasm to continue to build their knowledge and understanding of the cultures of families attending the centre.</p><p>Teachers meet regularly to discuss, reflect on and share best practice for learning and teaching. They expressed appreciation for opportunities to participate in decision making and take leadership roles in the day-to-day running of the centre. Teachers bring a wide range of useful experience and expertise to their roles. They are skilled at promoting early literacy and mathematical learning in the meaningful context of children’s play. Examples of good teaching practice observed by ERO include:</p><ul>
<li>calm and unhurried interactions amongst teachers and children</li>
<li>learning conversations that used rich language, sustained dialogue and extended children’s thinking and problem solving skills</li>
<li>promoting children’s leadership and confidence to make decisions, express opinions and share their knowledge with adults and other children</li>
<li>sensitive and responsive interactions with children that promote a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging</li>
<li>planning a programme that acknowledges and responds to children’s questions, interests and cultures</li>
<li>presenting an aesthetically pleasing and stimulating environment that invites children to explore and investigate.</li>
</ul><p>Children pursue their interests for sustained periods of time alongside interested teachers and their friends. Older children demonstrate high levels of social skills as they welcome visitors, engage in complex games and support other children in tuakana-teina relationships. They enter confidently into imaginative play and take on complex roles alongside their teachers. Children demonstrate confidence in expressing themselves through the creative arts. Their creations are highly valued by teachers and displayed on an art gallery wall.</p><p>A particular feature of the programme is the emphasis on learning about Papatūānuku and the living world. Good use is made of technology to inspire and extend learning through research and the use of high quality and scientifically accurate displays. Children’s learning is displayed throughout the centre and in well-presented profile books that celebrate the individual development of each child.</p><p>The recently implemented learning cycle includes:</p><ul>
<li>aspirational goals increasingly co-constructed with families and whanau</li>
<li>specific teaching strategies to achieve identified learning outcomes</li>
<li>the voices of children, teachers and families</li>
<li>learning stories as evidence of children’s learning experiences</li>
<li>evaluations of learning that document the progress and development of children over time.</li>
</ul><p>The centre programme has a good balance of child-led and teacher-directed opportunities. Teachers have established positive relationships with the neighbouring school, enjoy reciprocal relationships and make use of the extensive school grounds for exploration. Children are familiar with the adjacent school environment before they transition to school. This provides a greater awareness of their future environment and supports a positive experience for them.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management, leaders and ERO agree that the centre is likely to benefit from:</p><ul>
<li>ongoing support and mentoring for leaders and the embedding of the planning and assessment cycle introduced through recent and ongoing professional development</li>
<li>reviewing and refining performance management systems and practices. Particular emphasis should be placed on developing and documenting a more explicit policy and procedural statement that has clear links to the endorsement of practicing teacher criteria.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, management should continue to work with an external provider to develop systematic self-review systems and processes that focus on all aspects of the service’s operation and informs strategic planning. Giving particular attention to:</p><ul>
<li>regularly reviewing specific areas of the curriculum</li>
<li>teacher cultural competencies and the use of te reo Māori</li>
<li>children with special needs including children and families for whom English is a second language and gifted learners.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Talented Tots Mt Albert completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Talented Tots Mt Albert will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>21 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
