<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Halswell is located in the Halswell suburb of Christchurch. This kindergarten operates all day to provide care and education for 40 children over the age of two. All teachers are fully qualified and registered.</p><p align="left">It is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">Positive features of this kindergarten are:</p><ul>
<li>high quality relationships</li>
<li>a well planned and flexible learning programme</li>
<li>a collaborative team culture</li>
<li>a well resourced learning environment</li>
</ul><p align="left">The next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop the consistency of recording and analysing children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>extend the use of technology in the programme.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The association is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures, a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development.</p><p align="left">This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Halswell was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergartens Halswell.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The kindergarten provides a warm, welcoming and calm learning environment. Children are safe and given time and space to develop their interests and become competent learners. The environment reflects the kindergarten&rsquo;s commitment to biculturalism.</p><h4><em>Areas of strength</em></h4><h4>Relationships</h4><p align="left">Children benefit from high quality relationships. Teachers know the children and their families well, and warmly welcome them to the centre. Children show a strong sense of belonging, and settle well into the programme. ERO observed positive and inclusive interactions between children and teachers. Regular communication between children, teachers and families supports children&rsquo;s learning and well-being.</p><h4>Programme</h4><p align="left">Children willingly participate in a well planned and flexible learning programme. They confidently make choices from a wide variety of activities that are planned to promote independence and progress with their learning. Children are familiar with efficient routines and enjoy taking an active part in them. Children work and play together and demonstrate independence. Teachers actively encourage children to take risks and to problem solve. They model a range of strategies for supporting and managing children&rsquo;s learning and behaviour. ERO observed teachers supporting children in their play and learning activities.</p><h4>Team culture</h4><p align="left">Teachers work collaboratively to ensure appropriate learning outcomes for children. They reflect regularly and in depth on children&rsquo;s progress. They use relevant knowledge of children&rsquo;s interests and family input to develop the programme plans. Teachers make planning visible for families.</p><p align="left">Teachers provide very effective supervision for both groups and individuals. During this time, they frequently share information about children, and how they can support each other to extend children&rsquo;s learning and provide a range of experiences related to children&rsquo;s interests.</p><p align="left">The teaching team is well lead and inclusive. Teachers are supported and encouraged to contribute ideas and suggestions for centre developments.</p><h4>Environment</h4><p align="left">The outdoor environment provides a variety of opportunities for children to challenge themselves and each other. Children have contributed ideas for the layout and resources, increasing a sense of ownership and belonging.</p><p align="left">The indoor environment is well resourced. Children can easily access activities and equipment. Since the 2007 ERO review, teachers have reviewed the indoor environment to improve children&rsquo;s access to a variety of print. Teachers now need to consider how to further display work that shows children&rsquo;s individual creativity.</p><h4><em>Areas for development and review</em></h4><h4>Assessment</h4><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s assessments are well written and attractively presented. However, ERO observed variation in the analysis of learning and the planning for individual next steps for learning. Teachers should now consider ways to improve the consistency of recording and analysing children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h4>Extending the use of technology</h4><p align="left">Teachers have identified and ERO agrees that they now need to further develop the use of technology in the programme. This should enhance children&rsquo;s understanding and skill in using a wider range of technologies.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long-term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with Wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori Children in Early Childhood Services</h3><p align="left">As part of this review, ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this kindergarten understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the kindergarten</li>
<li>managers and teachers have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>this kindergarten works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">This kindergarten has four M&#257;ori children enrolled whose wh&#257;nau have identified as M&#257;ori.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">The teaching team has a high commitment to bicultural development. They provide welcoming environment for wh&#257;nau, and use the association&rsquo;s recent development of &lsquo;Kidsfirst Wh&#257;nau&rsquo; - a wh&#257;nau-based approach for involving and engaging parents in kindergarten life and their child&rsquo;s learning. As a result, M&#257;ori children experience an environment that respects their culture and provides a sense of belonging.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Halswell completed an ERO and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2><p align="left">ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore, ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table style="width: 568px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-halswell" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Halswell</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kidsfirst Kindergartens Halswell.</p><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Halswell is located in the Halswell suburb of Christchurch. This kindergarten operates all day to provide care and education for 40 children over the age of two. All teachers are fully qualified and registered.</p><p align="left">It is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">Positive features of this kindergarten are:</p><ul>
<li>high quality relationships</li>
<li>a well planned and flexible learning programme</li>
<li>a collaborative team culture</li>
<li>a well resourced learning environment</li>
</ul><p align="left">The next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop the consistency of recording and analysing children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>extend the use of technology in the programme.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The association is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures, a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development.</p><p align="left">This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p></html>
