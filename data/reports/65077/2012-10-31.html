<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2>
<p><strong>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</strong></p>
<p>The centre managers have improved many processes for promoting positive outcomes for children. They have developed a new strategic approach, and managers are effectively promoting a culture of critical reflection with the new teaching team. The service is well placed to bring about the necessary improvements.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Since November 2011, the service has been owned and administered by Kidicorp Ltd.</p>
<p>The centre managers are beginning to implement new policies and procedures in consultation with staff and parents.</p>
<p>There have been many staff changes. The management team has worked well with staff and parents to develop the centre's philosophy and strategic goals to link with its vision. Goals focus on improving teaching and learning and communicating and consulting with parents.</p>
<p>Prior to 2012, the impact of the Canterbury earthquakes slowed the ability of the centre managers to address some key areas for improvement identified in the 2009 ERO review.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>The programme provides children with opportunities and uninterrupted time to make choices and explore their ideas. ERO observed children playing cooperatively for extended periods of time. Children and teachers have fun as part of the learning process. Children are well supported to transition from the nursery to the preschool. In the nursery, children benefit from regular routines and high levels of individualised support and care.</p>
<p>Teachers in both the nursery and the preschool have respectful relationships and interactions with children. These interactions strongly reflect the centre&rsquo;s philosophy. Teachers consistently focus on responding to the interests and needs of children.</p>
<p>Managers and teachers make good use of parent consultation to inform the future direction and goals for the service. They have developed some useful strategies to involve parents more effectively in their children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p>Self review is becoming an increasingly useful tool to support the centre&rsquo;s ongoing improvement. Managers and teachers have undertaken some effective spontaneous self review. They are improving planned reviews with more focus on achieving the centre&rsquo;s goals. They now have a clearer understanding of where they need to improve.</p>
<p>In order to further improve the quality of teaching and learning, the managers and ERO agree that the centre should:</p>
<ul><li>fully implement the new staff performance appraisal process</li>
<li>extend teachers' guidelines for teaching and children&rsquo;s assessments</li>
<li>strengthen how they evaluate the effectiveness of teaching and learning programmes.</li>
<li>strengthen bicultural perspectives in the programme, environment and documentation.</li>
</ul><p>The managers and teachers should also make bicultural perspectives more explicit in documentation; reflect these in the environment; and increase the use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in the programme.</p>
<a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Beckenham completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select &lsquo;have&rsquo; or &lsquo;have not&rsquo; taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3. Next Review</span></h2>
<h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p>

<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>Review focus</h3>
<p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p>
<ul><li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p></html>
