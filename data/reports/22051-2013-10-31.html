</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Takapuna Playcentre operates as a parent cooperative within the North Shore Playcentre Association. The playcentre is licensed for 30 children including 15 up to two years. The centre offers four family sessions each week for parents, and children of mixed ages, and one session a week for older children. The playcentre operates from a building on an urban council reserve. The well-maintained grounds provide children with many opportunities for exploration and play.</p><p>The North Shore Playcentre Association is the umbrella organisation for twenty one playcentres situated in North Auckland. Many of these centres are semi-rural. The Association manages and distributes centres’ funding and provides a training programme for parents/whānau to achieve playcentre qualifications. It also has good systems to support centre members to manage the playcentres and to provide educational programmes for children. The Association is currently reviewing many aspects of its operations to help reduce the administrative workload for its members.</p><p>The 2010 ERO report identified many positive aspects of the centre operations that continue to be evident. The report also identified some aspects of programme evaluation that could be improved. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of twelve playcentre reviews in the North Shore Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children interact positively and confidently with each other and with adults. They benefit from respectful and responsive relationships with parents during sessions. Their strong sense of belonging in this centre is reinforced by displays of their art. Centre parents support children to direct their own learning. They value conversations with children and genuinely listen to their ideas. Parents share the responsibility and opportunities to engage with all children.</p><p>Centre parents welcome the increasingly cultural diversity of the playcentre’s families. They find opportunities to learn about each others’ languages and identities during sessions. Parents are encouraged to converse and record narratives for children’s portfolios in their home language. Parents’ strong support for each other extends beyond playcentre.</p><p>A bicultural partnership with Māori whānau is evident in Association operations. The management team has a strong commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and to building both adults’ and children’s familiarity with te reo and tikanga Māori. Centre parents work together to promote New Zealand’s bicultural heritage. They support each other to build their confidence in using te reo Māori with children. Appropriate tikanga Māori practices enrich the centre’s programme.</p><p>Centre parents have developed effective systems to monitor and maintain planning and assessment practices. They regularly update and share information about their own child’s current interests and learning priorities. Parents record narratives for their own and other people’s children that capture the child’s interests, learning and participation in the programme.</p><p>Centre leaders share responsibility for centre management and organisation with other parents. They provide good information, mentoring and support to parents who are new to playcentre.</p><p>Centre leaders use self review well to support ongoing improvement in the centre. They monitor their progress towards goals in relation to the annual plan. Centre leaders ensure parents have the opportunity to contribute to self review. They also network with other centres to help them make informed decisions.</p><p>The Association management team takes responsibility for specific tasks relating to the function of the Association. They are committed to and enthusiastic about their involvement in playcentre and actively foster emergent leadership to help sustain the association. The management team demonstrates the professional leadership necessary to help the association respond to change, make decisions and manage issues as they arise. The North Shore Playcentre Association provides effective support to help this playcentre remain well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre parents are committed to the ongoing improvement of the playcentre. They have identified the need to further involve families through social events. Some useful next steps for centre parents could be to:</p><ul>
<li>encourage increasing independence in younger children</li>
<li>continue to develop their confidence in using te reo Māori</li>
<li>evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives in terms of promoting positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>make all resources accessible to children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Takapuna Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Takapuna Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>31 October 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
