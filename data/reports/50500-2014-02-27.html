<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Background</span></h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Stratford Community Childcare Centre governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the January 2013 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate the extent of improvement in:</p><ul>
<li>ensuring the programme responds to children&rsquo;s strengths, interests and learning needs</li>
<li>establishing an environment that consistently creates opportunities for exploration, creativity and sustained engagement</li>
<li>implementing a more robust appraisal process for staff</li>
<li>the committee's understanding of its role in improving outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>The Stratford Community Childcare Centre is licensed to offer whole-day care and education for thirty-five children, including 10 up to two years old. The community based, non-profit childcare organisation is governed by a voluntary committee of elected parents who support the management of the centre.</p><p>Since the January 2013 ERO report a new senior teacher has been appointed to take responsibility for day-to-day care and education.</p><p>A comprehensive action plan to respond to the findings of the previous review was collaboratively developed in 2013 in association with the Ministry of Education (the Ministry) and ERO.</p><p>Significant progress in the quality of learning experiences for children has been made as the improvement plan has been successfully implemented. There is also increased understanding of the various elements of centre self review.</p><p>The centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>A calm, positive tone promotes purposeful interactions and supports learning. Children initiate play opportunities and conversations with adults and other children, including with young infants.</p><p>Teachers have positive, sensitive and responsive relationships with children. They know children well. Children&rsquo;s thinking is challenged and extended.</p><p>Children display high levels of interest in learning experiences and activities. They regularly receive feedback that acknowledges their effort and success. Teachers play alongside them, often for sustained periods, extending thinking and language.</p><p>Changes to the organisation of the programme have enabled the day to be mostly child-led activity. The physical environment offers challenges and choices that encourage exploration. Children are involved in a wide variety of activities that are relevant and enjoyable. Literacy and numeracy learning is enhanced.</p><p>Documentation captures the responsiveness of teachers to children&rsquo;s needs. Individual profile books celebrate children&rsquo;s involvement and learning in a range of contexts. These affirm the child&rsquo;s developing identity and strengths.</p><p>Responsive caregiving, within a family environment, supports infants&rsquo; and toddlers&rsquo; need for secure attachments. Each child&rsquo;s changing needs and preferences is a priority. Teachers maintain a calm tone in which younger children have space and time to lead their learning.</p><p>Partnership with parents and wh&#257;nau in matters affecting the programme is valued. Ongoing dialogue supports the sharing and extension of children&rsquo;s interests. Parents are consulted and have opportunities to contribute to the centre's self review.</p><p>Teachers focus on improvement, particularly in relation to developing the programme and assessment. They are reflective and collaborative. The appraisal process supports reflection and improvement. Regular reference is made to research and identified best practice as a basis for raising effectiveness.</p><p>Ongoing conversations between staff build teacher capability and increase the quality of the programme for children. Strong professional leadership and a positive team approach are supporting significant shifts in teaching and learning.</p><p>The governing committee has a clear understanding of its roles and responsibilities. Committee members are building knowledge of how the programme supports good quality outcomes for children. Appropriate policies and procedures are in place to support effective care and education. A&nbsp;positive working relationship exists between the committee and staff.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s evaluation identifies, and the centre agrees, that areas for further improvement are continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>build the extent to which the programme is responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and needs</li>
<li>improve the quality of learning stories to better reflect the progress children are making.</li>
</ul><p>The recent self-review focus has been to successfully implement the comprehensive action plan developed in association with the Ministry and ERO. Further development of the strategic and annual plan will support the identification of priorities for the future.</p><p>The centre philosophy is currently being reviewed. It is based on the principles of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. The centre agrees that it should now involve parents in further development of the philosophy.</p><p>Te reo M&#257;ori is integrated across the programme and children enthusiastically share their developing knowledge. The centre should continue to strengthen te ao M&#257;ori perspectives within the environment and programme.</p><a id="3-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Future Action</h2><p><strong>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</strong></p><p>The next ERO review of Stratford Community Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p><img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>27 February 2014</p><a id="information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Service</h2><table>
