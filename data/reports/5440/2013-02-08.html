<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Northcote is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens administers 62 kindergartens and one early learning centre in Canterbury and the West Coast. An education services manager works with each kindergarten giving feedback and professional support. All teachers are registered and fully qualified. Families from a diverse range of cultures attend this kindergarten.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in nine kindergartens within the Kidsfirst Kindergartens umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers give appropriate emphasis to promoting and creating positive and respectful relationships (manaakitanga) with children, their families and each other. Teachers care for and nurture children well and regularly have conversations with them about their interests and home lives. Teachers support children to develop social skills and play successfully together. Teachers take time to talk with parents about their children and experiences outside the kindergarten. As a result, teachers know children well and are able to use what they know to help them interact with children in meaningful ways. Teachers work well as a team, supporting each other in the programme and modelling positive interactions for children.</p><p>This kindergarten has many families from a wide range of cultural backgrounds. Teachers are focused on making all families feel welcome in the environment. The kindergarten has many displays that represent and show value to families&rsquo; cultures. Teachers ensure that families who do not have English as their first language have useful information about their child&rsquo;s involvement in the kindergarten. Teachers make good use of community resources to provide additional support for some children and their families. Children and their families show a strong sense of belonging in the kindergarten environment.</p><p>Teachers make good use of their individual strengths and interests to extend the experiences provided for children. Particular features of the programme include science, healthy living and a focus on supporting children&rsquo;s language development.</p><p>Children are also benefiting from a programme that promotes their awareness of, and experiences in M&#257;ori culture and identity. Teachers have had professional development in te reo M&#257;ori and are confident in integrating M&#257;ori language throughout the programme. Children regularly hear te reo M&#257;ori in a variety of contexts and have good opportunities to use te reo M&#257;ori themselves, including through conversation, waiata and haka.</p><p>Children are able to select from a range of new activities and revisit past favourites to extend their learning. Teachers have developed interesting themed areas for children to explore. The kindergarten places a strong emphasis on the natural world. Teachers provide many opportunities for children to be involved in caring for the kindergarten garden. The outdoor area gives children room to make their own discoveries and test ideas in a safe environment. The programme flows smoothly with children moving calmly from one activity to the next.</p><p>Teachers help build children&rsquo;s curiosity through skilled questioning. Teachers&rsquo; interactions with children are warm and supportive. They use conversations to help children talk about their thinking and expand their ideas. Teachers respond effectively to requests from children who seek their support.</p><p>The appraisal process provides useful feedback and supports teachers as they reflect on their practice. Professional development is well targeted to support teachers in their commitment to the ongoing improvement of teaching and learning practices.</p><p>Kidsfirst has a well-developed policy and practice framework to support the daily and long-term operation of the kindergarten. The association is kept well informed about the work of the kindergarten. Kidsfirst managers have recently developed a new process for reviewing and reporting kindergarten information. This process is likely to help them further target their support to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>The Kidsfirst Kindergarten managers and the teaching team have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps to improve learning outcomes for children are to more clearly show the depth of knowledge teachers have about each child. This includes continuing to develop:</p><p><em>Assessment</em></p><ul>
<li>how teachers make use of parent aspirations</li>
<li>children&rsquo;s views about their learning</li>
<li>the strategies teachers will use to extend on individual children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>the progression of children&rsquo;s learning over time.</li>
</ul><p><em>Programme Planning</em></p><ul>
<li>purposeful use of individual assessment information to guide programme planning</li>
<li>clear learning outcomes and teaching strategies</li>
<li>the evaluation of the impact of teaching practices on learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>children&rsquo;s involvement in decision making and use of technology to extend on learning.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers should also continue to strengthen self-review practices including critically evaluating the impact of changes on learning outcomes for children.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Northcote completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they select &lsquo;have&rsquo; or &lsquo;have not&rsquo; taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.Click here to enter text.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>8 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
