</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Sparks Queenstown is a home-based education and care service for children from birth-to- school age. Their care and learning is provided by educators (nannies or au pairs) in home settings. Some of the educators are qualified teachers.</p><p>The service is privately owned. The owner and coordinators are qualified early childhood teachers. They regularly visit educators in their homes and provide support and advice with the intention of ensuring children are well cared for and well supported in their learning and development.</p><p>The service's philosophy emphasises the importance of children learning in a safe, warm, nurturing and unhurried environment. Self-directed learning in the context of play are foremost within a stimulating programme. Educators see children as confident and capable learners.</p><p>ERO reviewed this service in 2013 and it received a very positive report. This review (2016) found that the service has continued to build on its strengths and made very good progress against the 2013 recommendations.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Coordinators provide high quality support for the educators, with a focus on what is best for children. Their visits focus on ensuring children are safe, well supported in their learning, and emotionally nurtured. Coordinators provide detailed oral and written feedback to educators about these areas. They model best practice and set useful goals with educators to best support children's learning.</p><p>ERO found strong evidence that educators are very well supported to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>respond to parents' wishes about their children’s learning and wellbeing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maintain frequent communication with parents about their children's play, wellbeing, learning and development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make meaningful use of home and community settings to enrich children’s learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>There is a strong focus on children's learning. Coordinators discuss children's learning goals with educators. They provide specific ideas, and/or resources and encourage responsiveness to children's emerging interests. Coordinators work with the educators to ensure that changes and transition to school are managed in children's best interests.</p><p>Coordinators share best practice about the care, learning and development of infants and toddlers. They encourage close rapport between educators and babies. The home setting and low adult-to-child ratio create a nurturing environment for infants and toddlers.</p><p>The owner ensures educators have frequent opportunities to extend their understanding of current theories of learning, and how best to support children's learning and wellbeing. Coordinators build on this, in addition to sharing their own professional knowledge. Parents are often included in professional learning meetings.</p><p>Coordinators deliberately keep the service’s priorities, such as bicultural practices and child-led learning, to the fore. They encourage broad-learning experiences, such as physical exploration, a Māori dimension and early literacy. They model and support educators to document children's learning and involve parents in this process.</p><p>This service is very well managed and governed. It has clear strategic goals and useful plans to ensure that these are implemented to a high standard. Systems and practices within the service align well with its strategic goals. This has resulted in well-managed change and improvement.</p><p>The owner is continually exploring how the service could improve its provision for children. She seeks ongoing advice from an external consultant, and periodically undertakes external audits. She has built purposeful relationships with other local educational providers and community organisations. The appraisal system has been adapted and improved to align more closely with the Education Council expectations.</p><p>Positive relationships and effective communication are very evident in this service. The owner works closely with her coordinator team. She and her coordinators maintain regular contact with educators and families. They keep families well informed about events, service priorities and news.</p><p>Internal evaluation in this service is ongoing, systematic and focused on what is best for children. The owner and coordinators gather and analyse relevant information, including the views of parents. Past reviews have led to well-informed change and improvement. Although leaders have a sound understanding of effective internal evaluation, it would be useful to develop more detailed guidelines to document this process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the owner and coordinators are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further develop guidelines/information for educators that detail how to best support children’s learning in a home setting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen educators' planning and assessment of children's' learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Sparks Queenstown completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>This review found that the service had comprehensive policies, procedures and systems related to children's health and safety. These were regularly reviewed by the owner and were audited by an external provider. ERO recommends extending some risk-management plans for excursions by including more detail as to how adults would mitigate potential risks.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Sparks Queenstown will be in four years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern Te Waipounamu</p><p>7 February 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
