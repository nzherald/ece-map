</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Piha Community Preschool is a well established centre that provides an early childhood service for Auckland’s west coast beach communities of Piha and Karekare. The centre began as a local playgroup and this continues to run in the premises on Mondays.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 27 children. In response to community needs, the parent committee and staff have recently worked collaboratively to provide for children over two years only. While maintaining a licence for children under two years, this change has enabled more older children to access the service. Inside environments have been rearranged to cater for the older group of children and plans are underway to redevelop the outdoor area.</p><p>The centre is governed by a Trust Board which works with the parent committee and staff to govern and manage the centre. There is continuity at all levels with more experienced members sharing their skills and experience to support newer members.</p><p>The centre philosophy describes play as the basis for children’s learning. A focus on engaging and participating in the community is also highlighted. These features of the philosophy are well reflected in the programme.</p><p>Piha Community Preschool has a good ERO reporting history. ERO’s report in April 2010 noted the good quality education and care that was a result of effective leadership, management and teaching.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children eagerly explore their imaginative play ideas and confidently communicate with others. They are developing a sense of themselves as capable learners, as teachers provide them with opportunities for leadership and decision-making. Relationships in the centre are warm and positive. Teachers work closely with children and support them to enjoy and be well engaged in the programme.</p><p>Children experience a varied curriculum with good learning options over the day. Teachers design the programme to better meet the needs of an older group of children. The variety and accessibility of resources continues to be improved. Teachers provide appropriate and well resourced early literacy and numeracy learning. The centre curriculum is clearly based on the local area and promotes the use of the natural environment to support children’s learning.</p><p>Programme planning for ongoing projects is evident in wall displays. Staff use their individual strengths and skills to benefit children’s learning. They take leadership roles in curriculum areas and with new centre initiatives. Children experience many creative art opportunities both within the centre and in the community. Their work is valued, with children’s art displayed as part of a Matariki exhibition at the local gallery.</p><p>Centre leaders and staff demonstrate a genuine interest in children and their families. Recent centre changes have been well led, and warm relationships amongst the team have been sustained. Links are well maintained between trustees, parents and staff. Families receive good information about the centre through a variety of communication channels. Ongoing work around transition to school, in response to parents’ requests, continues to result in appropriate outcomes for children and families.</p><p>Centre self review is collaborative and inclusive. Teachers’ reflection and evaluation results in improved learning outcomes for children. Centre leaders recognise the continued need to develop governance and management frameworks and to plan reviews more strategically. They are also exploring the possibility of establishing a management support role to allow more time for the head teacher to lead curriculum development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that key next steps in centre development are to:</p><ul>
<li>enhance parent contribution to planning for children’s learning and demonstrate through the curriculum what children and families bring to learning in terms of their language, culture and identity</li>
<li>work with whānau Māori to identify what success as Māori looks like in this setting</li>
<li>link appraisal to the Registered Teacher Criteria and develop a professional learning and development plan to meet individual and centre wide needs</li>
<li>continue to review teacher roles, responsibilities and rosters to enhance teachers’ response to children’s learning interests.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Piha Community Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement</em> and<em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Piha Community Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>7 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
