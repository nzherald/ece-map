</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>St Clair Community Kindergarten is a small kindergarten, established nearly one hundred years ago. The roll is flourishing. The kindergarten provides morning and afternoon sessions for up to 28 children aged approximately two and a half to five years. There is a longer day session for older children on Fridays.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by a parent-led committee. Many parents are actively involved in the kindergarten. They share their skills and talents with children and provide rostered parent help for each session.</p><p>A feature of this kindergarten is the well-qualified and experienced teachers. As a team they work effectively together and have developed strong links with families over time.</p><p>This review found that teachers and the committee have continued to build on the strengths identified in the 2010 ERO review. The kindergarten leaders and teachers are dedicated to ongoing improvement for the benefit of their children. The kindergarten has achieved a healthy-heart award and runs a weekly play-gym session.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families benefit from:</p><ul>
<li>strong, positive relationships with the teachers and each other</li>
<li>teachers who know and follow the children’s strengths, interests and abilities well.</li>
</ul><p>The kindergarten’s philosophy:</p><ul>
<li>has been shared with children in ways they understand</li>
<li>is evident in practice</li>
<li>has been reviewed by involving parents and the wider community in discussions about its ongoing relevance.</li>
</ul><p>Children play and learn in well-resourced indoor and outdoor environments. Teachers thoughtfully work with the children to present the resources and environment in response to children’s individual interests and choices. Teachers sensitively follow the children’s lead to promote and enrich their learning. They have high-quality conversations with children to draw on their prior knowledge and extend their thinking. ERO observed children highly engaged and sustained in their learning.</p><p>Children benefit from a well-planned, rich programme which includes:</p><ul>
<li>music, movement, the arts and dramatic play</li>
<li>the living world</li>
<li>early literacy and mathematics, and information and communication technologies (ICT)</li>
<li>healthy living</li>
<li>learning about the world of the local and wider community.</li>
</ul><p>Children benefit from learning about New Zealand’s unique bicultural heritage. Teachers ensure that children regularly hear and use some te reo Māori, waiata and karakia. Children learn about cultural concepts such as tuakana-teina and whanaungatanga. There is a good range of resources to stimulate and support this learning. Children’s diverse cultural backgrounds are acknowledged and celebrated.</p><p>Transitions into and out of the kindergarten and between sessions are well managed. Teachers are very responsive to the changing needs of the children. They seek parents’ wishes for their children’s learning and work with them to set and meet high expectations for all aspects of children’s learning and care.</p><p>The teachers work well as a team, share their ideas and regularly reflect on aspects of the programme with a view to improvement. The senior leaders collaborate with the parent committee to assist them in their governance role.</p><p>The parent committee effectively supports centre leaders to manage the kindergarten in the best interests of children. Committee members have:</p><ul>
<li>clear roles and responsibilities, including for ongoing training</li>
<li>an effective long-term strategic plan to guide the centre’s direction</li>
<li>useful policies and procedures to ensure the effective running of the centre.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teachers’ appraisal system should be further strengthened to ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>goals are measureable and clearly linked to the current Registered Teacher Criteria</li>
<li>evidence of progress towards meeting the expectations of their role and goals is appropriately gathered and recorded.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers need to strengthen self review. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>improving the current schedule and guidelines for review</li>
<li>better documenting the process and outcomes of reviews.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of St Clair Community Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of St Clair Community Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>28 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
