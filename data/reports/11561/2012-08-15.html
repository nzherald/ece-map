<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Parklands Playcentre is part of the Northland Playcentre Association. Centre members currently operate four sessions per week. The Association provides a management and policy framework to guide centre practices and a centre support worker provides advice and guidance for parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>Playcentre members provide good quality care and learning for their children. Since the 2009 ERO review members have made progress in addressing the areas identified for improvement. They have developed their learning story templates, are identifying children&rsquo;s interests in their portfolios, and have introduced a day book which records children&rsquo;s and adult interactions throughout the session.</p><p>Centre members provide an atmosphere that is warm and welcoming. Children benefit from having the opportunity to play in mixed age groups. They experience an environment where their wellbeing is promoted and families feel a sense of belonging. There is a wide variety of resources available. Parents provide children with resources to help extend their engagement with activities.</p><p>Centre members share roles and responsibilities, and participate in Association meetings on a regular basis. New members have been keen to do their Course One Level certificates. The parent committee is working on establishing a team of parents who have sufficient training levels to spread the roles and responsibilities throughout the parent group. Members use Association systems effectively to manage the centre.</p><p>ERO and the centre members, along with the centre support person, agree that members should engage in appropriate training levels to ensure programmes remain sustainable.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, Parklands Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and centre members. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atParklands Playcentre.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Redevelopment plans for the outdoor area have been a major focus for parent members, and they have successfully completed stage one of the project. The Northland Playcentre Association has supported the centre with this development.</p><p>Since the 2009 ERO review, members have also focused on improving their systems for responding to and recording children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><em>Parent involvement.</em> The parent co-operative is taking responsibility for the development of the Playcentre. Sustaining the good systems currently in the centre is an ongoing focus for the centre members. Parents support each other well during sessions to ensure good outcomes for children.</p><p><em>Sharing good practice.</em> Parents feel welcomed into the Playcentre environment. Modelling of conversations by more experienced members encourages new parents working with children. Longer-term members share what they have learned about how to plan session activities. Parents work alongside children to foster their interests and support their learning and development.</p><p><em>Outcomes for children.</em> Children are engaged in the centre programme and enjoy opportunities to explore and extend their learning. Parents plan the programme appropriately to accommodate the age range of children. Members encourage children to explore resources and share in conversations. Friendships have been established and children respond well to other parents in the Playcentre</p><p><em>Planning, assessment and evaluation.</em> Planning is based on parents&rsquo; recording children&rsquo;s interests in the day book. This is evaluated and then the programme plan is completed as a group. Learning stories are used to document children&rsquo;s participation in the programme and form a record of children&rsquo;s time at the centre. Some parents contribute to other children&rsquo;s portfolios. As new members gain more confidence in writing learning stories, they should be encouraged to write learning stories for other children.</p><p><em>Environment.</em> The first stage of the redevelopment of the outdoor environment has been very successful. The area has been redesigned to include a landscaped walkway, a tunnel and slide facilities. This area is easily supervised and provides children with opportunities to explore and use their imagination. This has improved the opportunities for children to develop their physical play experiences. A second stage is planned, including the purchase of moveable equipment that can be used in a variety of ways to cater for older as well as younger children&rsquo;s physical growth and development.</p><p><em>Association support.</em> The centre is well supported by the Northland Playcentre Association. Te Roopu Whakaaro Kotahi provides resources to further support the development of bicultural understandings. The Kaiawhaina who visits the centre once a term provides good feedback and next steps to support wh&#257;nau that attend. She encourages the use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in the programme. This support could be used to further develop and build centre members&rsquo; confidence in this area.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p><em>Self review.</em> Parents should now consider how they can review the programme and centre routines to identify the impact of adult practices on children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Parent participation. Longer-term members should consider how they can best help new members become more confident and skilled in working with all children in the Playcentre.</p><p><em>Portfolios.</em> Once parents become more skilled in documenting children&rsquo;s interests and strengths and recording them in portfolios, they could begin to identify children&rsquo;s learning. Identifying links between learning stories should provide parents with a record of children&rsquo;s learning development over time.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the members of Parklands Playcentre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendation</h2><p>ERO and centre members, with support from the Association, agree that members should continue to develop self-review practices in all areas of the Playcentre to continue to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

Centre members currently operate four sessions per week. The Association provides a management and policy framework to guide centre practices and a centre support worker provides advice and guidance for parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>Playcentre members provide good quality care and learning for their children. Since the 2009 ERO review members have made progress in addressing the areas identified for improvement. They have developed their learning story templates, are identifying children&rsquo;s interests in their portfolios, and have introduced a day book which records children&rsquo;s and adult interactions throughout the session.</p><p>Centre members provide an atmosphere that is warm and welcoming. Children benefit from having the opportunity to play in mixed age groups. They experience an environment where their wellbeing is promoted and families feel a sense of belonging. There is a wide variety of resources available. Parents provide children with resources to help extend their engagement with activities.</p><p>Centre members share roles and responsibilities, and participate in Association meetings on a regular basis. New members have been keen to do their Course One Level certificates. The parent committee is working on establishing a team of parents who have sufficient training levels to spread the roles and responsibilities throughout the parent group. Members use Association systems effectively to manage the centre.</p><p>ERO and the centre members, along with the centre support person, agree that members should engage in appropriate training levels to ensure programmes remain sustainable.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
