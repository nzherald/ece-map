<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Doubtless Bay Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Doubtless Bay Kindergarten is one of three kindergartens in the Far North District governed by the board of the Kaitaia and Districts Kindergarten Association. A manager oversees kindergarten operations, including financial management and employment matters. Most kindergarten operations are guided by Association policies.</p><p>Professional Practice Managers (PPMs) from the Northland Kindergarten Association are contracted to support teachers&rsquo; professional learning and development, and their implementation of programmes for children.</p><p>The current head teacher has been recently appointed and one teacher is new to the staff. The head teacher manages the day to day operations of the kindergarten and works with qualified teachers to support children&rsquo;s learning and development. She has already reviewed several aspects of the operation of the kindergarten and is developing a strategic plan for 2013.</p><p>Children who attend the centre are mostly M&#257;ori and NZ European/P&#257;keh&#257; and come from a wide geographical area. They later move to one of six local schools. Each day, after kindergarten, children who are close to school age are able to spend a short time at the new entrant class of Taipa Area School, which is next door.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in three early childhood education services within the Kaitaia and Districts Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Relationships within the kindergarten and with the kindergarten community are positive and supportive. Teachers show respect for children as capable and competent learners. They listen to children&rsquo;s ideas and value their contributions in conversations. Children approach adults with confidence and show respect for each other and the kindergarten environment.</p><p>Teachers encourage and support open communication with parents. Parents report that they feel welcome in the centre. They sometimes spend time interacting with the children as they settle for the session. Children&rsquo;s individual portfolios and wall displays inform parents about their children&rsquo;s learning at the centre. Teachers consult with parents about what they want for their children and reflect on how they can support the children towards achieving their parents&rsquo; aspirations.</p><p>The programme is consistent with the kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy and <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. It reflects bicultural New Zealand, supporting the identity of all children and provides children with opportunities to learn through meaningful experiences.</p><p>Kindergarten staff use information and communication technologies (ICT) in innovative ways. ICT is used effectively to communicate with the wider kindergarten community and to share information about children&rsquo;s learning electronically with some families. Children use ICT, especially computers and cameras, with confidence.</p><p>The manager of the Kaitaia and Districts Kindergarten Association has also identified the need to strengthen self review at their governance and management levels. Further steps to improve their support for kindergarten teachers could include:</p><ul>
<li>support for teachers&rsquo; professional learning and development</li>
<li>induction and support for head teachers.</li>
</ul><p>The staff are reflective about their practice. They have formally reviewed some kindergarten operations and systems. They should continue to strengthen self-review practices, including the impact of change on outcomes for children.</p><p>Children would benefit from greater support from teachers to extend their learning through play. Teachers could consider how to improve:</p><ul>
<li>planning to extend children&rsquo;s thinking and deepen their understanding</li>
<li>ways of recording children&rsquo;s learning and how this information is used in ongoing programme planning.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have identified that they want to continue to build on the bicultural practices currently evident in the centre. Further developments could include greater acknowledgement of M&#257;ori children&rsquo;s strengths and interests, increased use of te reo M&#257;ori, and reflecting te ao M&#257;ori more prominently in the kindergarten environment.</p><p>To improve current reporting practices, the Association should ensure that information about the allocation and use of Ministry of Education equity funding is shared with the kindergarten community.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Doubtless Bay Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>25 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
