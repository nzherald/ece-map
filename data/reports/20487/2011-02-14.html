<p align="left">St Heliers/Glendowie Playcentre, on the boundary of Churchill Park, is a well established centre that operates as a parent cooperative. The centre is open for five sessions a week and is part of the Tamaki Playcentre Association. The Association provides a comprehensive adult education programme, a framework of policies and procedures, and personnel to support centre members. The 2007 ERO report noted that adult interactions with children were respectful, positive and caring. Centre practices were strongly reflective of the Playcentre philosophy. These good practices continue to be evident.</p>
<p align="left">Since the 2007 ERO report, centre members have engaged in professional development to improve planning and assessment. Displays of children&rsquo;s learning stories and children&rsquo;s assessment portfolios reflect children&rsquo;s progress and development. Centre members are aware they could continue to refine aspects of assessment and planning to make the extension of children&rsquo;s learning more clearly evident.</p>
<p align="left">Warm, trusting and supportive relationships among families underpin the inclusive and welcoming tone of the centre. Children are confident with adults and play positively with and alongside peers. Centre members affirm children&rsquo;s ideas, acknowledge their preferences and encourage children to join in groups. Centre members assist each other in the care of each other&rsquo;s children and ensure that infants and toddlers can safely experience a wide range of activities. Children and adults enjoy learning and playing together.</p>
<p align="left">Children engage in a good quality programme and are curious and enthusiastic learners. Centre members provide a vibrant, well resourced learning environment that stimulates and sustains children&rsquo;s engagement in play. Adults talk frequently with children to foster their oral language development. Centre members&rsquo; next challenges are to further extend child-initiated play and to foster more opportunities for older children to use problem-solving, investigative and independent thinking skills in their play.</p>
<p align="left">The centre is well managed and centre members are establishing robust self-review processes. They are aware that some aspects of self review could be further developed to support the ongoing development of the centre.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p align="left">Before the review, centre members of St Heliers- Glendowie Playcentre were invited to consider their priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and centre members. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atSt Heliers- Glendowie Playcentre.</p>
<p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p align="left">Since 2007 centre members have engaged in professional development on Kei Tua o Te Pae, Assessment for Learning: Early Childhood Exemplars, to improve assessment practices. They have made ongoing improvements to the inside and outside areas, including planting gardens. Further developments are planned to enhance the outdoor learning environment.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p align="left">Philosophy in practice. Centre members&rsquo; strong commitment to Playcentre philosophy, and their active role in their child&rsquo;s education, is evident in:</p>
<ul>
<li>high levels of support for each other in their dual role as parents and educators;</li>
<li>appreciation of support provided by the Association;</li>
<li>experienced centre members mentoring new members and encouraging emergent leadership;</li>
<li>members&rsquo; enthusiasm for, and engagement in, Playcentre&rsquo;s adult education programme; and</li>
<li>inclusive systems for communication and sharing information.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Families manage the centre cooperatively and efficiently. The main focus of each session is on supporting child&rsquo;s play and learning.</p>
<p align="left">Relationships. Respectful and responsive relationships between adults and children underpin the cheerful and welcoming tone of the centre. Families know each other well, and children are confident with adults and play positively alongside peers. Centre members assist each other in the care of each other&rsquo;s children and ensure infants and toddlers can safely explore a wide range of learning experiences. Adults have high expectations for children&rsquo;s behaviour, and model positive strategies for conflict resolution. They encourage children to join in and include others in group games and activities. Children&rsquo;s social and emotional development is nurtured.</p>
<p align="left">Stimulating learning environment. Centre members provide an attractive, well resourced learning environment that stimulates and supports children&rsquo;s engagement in play. In this Playcentre, children:</p>
<ul>
<li>choose areas of play independently and move confidently between activities;</li>
<li>are able to choose spaces that allow for quiet and active play;</li>
<li>maintain their involvement in play for sustained periods of time;</li>
<li>are supported by adults who know children&rsquo;s abilities and preferences;</li>
<li>share their enthusiasm for learning with parents and are able to revisit past experiences;</li>
<li>have many opportunities to try out creative and sensorial activities; and</li>
<li>are physically active in the large, well maintained and well equipped outside area and are encouraged to explore the natural world.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">This high quality learning environment is complemented by centre members who value and support child-initiated play and respond quickly to children who need assistance.</p>
<p align="left">Programme implementation. Centre members provide a good quality programme that fosters learning through play. They work collaboratively to ensure that children under two years of age are encouraged to explore and make discoveries in all areas of play and that all children:</p>
<ul>
<li>are consistently engaged in positive and supportive interactions;</li>
<li>are constantly affirmed as individuals; and</li>
<li>experience challenges and success and know that their learning is valued.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Children benefit from a flexible and responsive programme that gives them ample time to explore at their own pace and to develop competence in their chosen activity. They are actively and purposefully engaged in the programme.</p>
<p align="left">Confident capable children. Children are confident communicators who eagerly converse with others. Their language skills are enriched by adults frequently engaging children in meaningful conversations and introducing new vocabulary at appropriate times. Experienced centre members model the use of open-ended questions to extend children&rsquo;s play and learning. As a result of these good practices, children are curious, have fun and are eager to learn and find things out.</p>
<p align="left">Assessment informs planning. Centre members are developing a collective understanding of assessment, planning and evaluation. The combined benefits of previous external professional development and Playcentre training are evident in:</p>
<ul>
<li>assessment information, which is gathered, shared among all members, and used to guide the programme;</li>
<li>displays of learning stories and photographs that show children&rsquo;s involvement in past experiences;</li>
<li>children&rsquo;s individual assessment portfolios, which provide adults and children with opportunities to revisit and celebrate children&rsquo;s learning and development.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Programme planning is meaningful, systematic and child-focused. Centre members have a good knowledge of Te Whariki, the early childhood curriculum, and of current assessment practices.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p align="left">Increasing challenge and complexity. Centre members could consider ways to increase the challenge and complexity of older children&rsquo;s learning opportunities. Experienced members could continue to support other parents and wh&#257;nau to further extend children&rsquo;s learning, and to foster the use of more problem-solving, investigative and independent thinking skills in play situations. Increasing children&rsquo;s use of literacy and numeracy in the context of play would also enrich children&rsquo;s learning opportunities.</p>
<p align="left">Making children&rsquo;s interests more visible. Centre members could continue to refine systems for documenting children&rsquo;s assessment, planning and evaluation. They could consider ways to:</p>
<ul>
<li>more consistently record the results of actions taken by adults to support and extend children&rsquo;s emergent interests;</li>
<li>make end of session evaluations more useful by determining children&rsquo;s specific interests, and in which area of play they arose, so that the interests could be extended at the next session; and</li>
<li>involve older children in planning and developing skills for self-directed learning.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Long-term goals and self-review plan. Centre members are aware they could enhance their current self-review processes. They could continue to build on their strategic plan by including long-term goals that focus on improving learning outcomes for children. Long-term goals should be supported by an annual plan that sets explicit objectives for the year. Reviewing centre practices and progress alongside the goals of Ka Hikitia: Managing for Success, the Ministry of Education strategy for M&#257;ori education, may assist members to review how well they meet the aspirations of M&#257;ori children and wh&#257;nau. These developments may help centre members to review and reflect on the quality of the programme and to plan strategically for the ongoing development of the centre.</p>

<p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Promoting Children&rsquo;s Social and Emotional Competence</h3>
<p align="left">As children learn to make sense of their world they develop an understanding of themselves in social contexts, including the early childhood service. As part of this review ERO looked at how each service&rsquo;s curriculum supports children&rsquo;s developing social and emotional competence.</p>
<p align="left">The findings are reported in the Quality of Education section of this report and used as part of a national evaluation report on this topic.</p>
<a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p align="left">Before the review, the centre members of St Heliers- Glendowie Playcentre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<a id="5-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Recommendation</h2>
<p align="left">ERO and centre members agreed that centre members should continue to strengthen self review and develop strategic and annual planning that focuses on continuous improvement of children&rsquo;s learning and the ongoing development of the centre.</p>
<a id="6-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6. Future Action</h2>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>

<p>14 February 2011</p>
<p>To the Parents and Community of St Heliers- Glendowie Playcentre</p>
<p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on St Heliers- Glendowie Playcentre.</p>
<p align="left">St Heliers/Glendowie Playcentre, on the boundary of Churchill Park, is a well established centre that operates as a parent cooperative. The centre is open for five sessions a week and is part of the Tamaki Playcentre Association. The Association provides a comprehensive adult education programme, a framework of policies and procedures, and personnel to support centre members. The 2007 ERO report noted that adult interactions with children were respectful, positive and caring. Centre practices were strongly reflective of the Playcentre philosophy. These good practices continue to be evident.</p>
<p align="left">Since the 2007 ERO report, centre members have engaged in professional development to improve planning and assessment. Displays of children&rsquo;s learning stories and children&rsquo;s assessment portfolios reflect children&rsquo;s progress and development. Centre members are aware they could continue to refine aspects of assessment and planning to make the extension of children&rsquo;s learning more clearly evident.</p>
<p align="left">Warm, trusting and supportive relationships among families underpin the inclusive and welcoming tone of the centre. Children are confident with adults and play positively with and alongside peers. Centre members affirm children&rsquo;s ideas, acknowledge their preferences and encourage children to join in groups. Centre members assist each other in the care of each other&rsquo;s children and ensure that infants and toddlers can safely experience a wide range of activities. Children and adults enjoy learning and playing together.</p>
<p align="left">Children engage in a good quality programme and are curious and enthusiastic learners. Centre members provide a vibrant, well resourced learning environment that stimulates and sustains children&rsquo;s engagement in play. Adults talk frequently with children to foster their oral language development. Centre members&rsquo; next challenges are to further extend child-initiated play and to foster more opportunities for older children to use problem-solving, investigative and independent thinking skills in their play.</p>
<p align="left">The centre is well managed and centre members are establishing robust self-review processes. They are aware that some aspects of self review could be further developed to support the ongoing development of the centre.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>
<p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p>
<p align="left"><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
