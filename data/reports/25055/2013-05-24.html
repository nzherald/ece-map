<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Kiwicare Coronation is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Kiwicare Coronation provides education and care for children from infants to school age in a well established centre in Papatoetoe. Teachers are well qualified. They have maintained the good practices noted in previous ERO reports.</p><p>The service is one of a cluster of Kiwicare centres in Papatoetoe, and is part of the Kiwisport Preschool Ltd. The centres share a vision and philosophy, and management systems and processes. The centre manager works closely with organisation managers who have overall responsibility for areas such as curriculum, learning extension, social competence and business operation. Together they provide quality assurance and ton ensure that management expectations are being met.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn in an inclusive environment and develop skills to help them be successful learners. The tone of the centre is calm and purposeful. Play areas are well equipped, attractively presented and provide children with many choices. Children develop an understanding of environmental sustainability and a growing sense of responsibility for themselves and others. Infants receive nurturing care and individualised routines.</p><p>Teachers plan a programme that includes teacher directed activities and opportunities for children to make choices about their play. The curriculum is influenced by <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum framework. It reflects the centre teaching philosophy that gives priority to academic knowledge and social competence. Children experience literacy, numeracy and science learning. Displays of children&rsquo;s projects show their involvement in the programme and provide good information for parents.</p><p>Teachers and the curriculum manager have developed useful procedures for assessment, and programme planning and evaluation. These include individual children&rsquo;s profiles that record their involvement in play and activities. Regular evaluations assist teachers to reflect on children&rsquo;s progress and plan for next learning steps.</p><p>Managers use research to inform their strategic direction and policy development. There is a clear alignment between the centre&rsquo;s vision of &lsquo;Healthy Bodies, Educated Minds, Successful Futures&rsquo;, and the centre philosophy and strategic plans. There are well established and effective management and administration systems. These systems support the centre to function smoothly and teachers to focus on the education and care of children.</p><p>Working relationships between managers and staff are positive. Performance management processes encourage the development of teaching practice. Staff have opportunities to take on leadership roles. Good professional leadership promotes professional learning and development at all levels. The supportive working environment and staff stability have a positive impact on children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers identify that they would like to continue strengthening their self-review processes and practices. ERO agrees that they could increase the usefulness of centre self review by:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau to increase their input into children&rsquo;s learning and centre review</li>
<li>promoting teacher reflections that evaluate the effectiveness of their teaching practice on outcomes for children</li>
<li>more consistently recording opportunities for children to plan and evaluate their own learning.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiwicare Coronation completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>24 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
