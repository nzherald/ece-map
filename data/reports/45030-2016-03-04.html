</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rotorua Hospital Early Childhood Centre is situated in the children's ward of Rotorua Hospital. It caters for children admitted to the ward, and for their whānau and siblings. The service is governed by the Lakes District Health Board. Day-to-day management of the service is shared by the charge hospital play specialist (HPS) and the clinical nurse manager.</p><p>The service's aim is to promote children's social and emotional wellbeing, and to support their whānau to feel a sense of welcome and belonging. The centre is licensed for 25 children up to six years of age. Numbers of children fluctuate on a daily basis. Many whānau have Māori heritage and there is a growing number of Pacific and Indian families with children in the ward.</p><p>The service is staffed by two qualified early childhood teachers, assisted by two relievers. The charge HPS also holds an additional hospital-based qualification. Some play and learning opportunities with children are undertaken at their bedside and in other parts of the hospital. This support is aimed at increasing children's wellbeing and supporting their confidence in dealing with complex medical procedures.</p><p>The HPS aim to provide play and learning experiences for children in this unfamiliar setting. The large playroom, deck space and outdoor area provide for exploration and different activities for children. There is space in the playroom for siblings and whānau.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children respond positively to opportunities to explore and find activities in the attractive and inviting playroom. The HPS include a wide range of resources to cater for children's interests and different ages and stages of development. Frequent conversations with whānau help in deciding what children might like to play with.</p><p>Special care is taken to acknowledge those children who are admitted to hospital on a regular basis. Their artwork and references to their previous visits are kept in the playroom to provide a sense of belonging and continuity.</p><p>HPS use some te reo Māori in conversations and interactions with children. The playroom decorations and resources are beginning to reflect bicultural understanding. The placement of the playroom, looking down on the lake and the marae provides a sense of belonging and familiarity for Māori whānau and their children. The HPS have identified their intention to improve their bicultural understanding as well as strengthening their understanding of Pacific cultures and languages.</p><p>Procedures are in place for the daily recording of children's interests, and suggestions for extending their play. However, these assessment procedures are not consistently followed. Shared responsibility for assessment and more equitable contribution to professional discussions and planning would improve the HPS team's ability to evaluate and enhance their support for children.</p><p>Governance of the service is provided by senior hospital managers. The charge nurse manager, the interdisciplinary staff working with children, and the HPS form a team that is passionate about providing a high quality service for children and their families. HPS have had opportunities to build their practice through supportive professional development, coaching and regular performance appraisal.</p><p>The service is in a good position to continue developing and refining systems and practices. The service's well written and meaningful philosophy statement and vision are evident in practice. Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the ward and the playroom by the HPS and relievers. Children are comfortable and quickly develop trusting relationships with HPS.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>There are good procedures in place for the ongoing development of the service. However, the service is not yet reaching its potential. It is urgent that managers continue to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen leadership and documentation, and increase accountability for the development of the service and the quality of support for children and their whānau</li>
<li>establish more regular internal evaluation that enables HPS to make judgements about the effectiveness of the service</li>
<li>make HPS' appraisal more meaningful by keeping evidence of work towards professional goals.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>To improve current practice, the service manager should seek support to increase the rigour of performance management systems and to align HPS appraisal processes with Education Council requirements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rotorua Hospital Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rotorua Hospital Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>4 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

<li>Pou Ārahi– how leadership is enacted to contribute to children’s learning and promote their wellbeing</li>
<li>Mātauranga– whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to contribute to children’s learning and promote their wellbeing</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako– how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity, contribute to children’s learning and promote their wellbeing</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness ofarotake– self review and ofwhanaungatanga– partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service responds to children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the methodology for ERO reviews in Hospital-based Education and Care Services.</p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to contribute to children’s learning and promote their wellbeing. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO's website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that contribute to children’s learning and wellbeing and are useful to the service.</p>
