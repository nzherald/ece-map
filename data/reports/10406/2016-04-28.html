</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Harinui Early Childhood Learning Centre, on the outskirts of Kerikeri, provides care and education for 30 children from birth to approximately three years old. The adjacent Arohanui Early Childhood Learning Centre caters for older children. Most children from Harinui transition to Arohanui. The centres are both under the same family ownership.</p><p>The centre philosophy focuses on promoting high quality outcomes for children, and the critical role of working in partnership with parents, families and the community. The philosophies of Magda Gerber and Resources for Infant Educators (RIE), and learning within natural environments also influence the curriculum.</p><p>The 2014 opening of Ngaherenui, a large, natural wilderness area behind the centre, is providing an environment where teachers promote children’s respectful engagement with the natural world.</p><p>Teachers are well qualified and many are long-serving staff members. Ratios of teachers to children are very good. Infants benefit from a ratio of 1 teacher to 3 children in their dedicated space.</p><p>The centre has a very good ERO reporting history. The high quality practices identified in previous ERO reports continue to be evident in all aspects of centre performance.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre’s philosophy is highly evident in practice. A sense of wellbeing and belonging for people, and care and respect for the natural world, are features of the centre.</p><p>Children are actively involved in the programme. They are able to explore their ideas in a calm, unhurried way. Their imaginative play is a highlight of the programme. The stimulating environments of both Ngaherenui and the centre provide many choices which children manage well. Children are encouraged to take on challenges with their learning, with teachers providing sensitive support.</p><p>Teachers are respectful and affirming and support children’s growing independence with gentleness and care. Routines are familiar and consistently implemented. Teachers are very skilled, and their effective teamwork supports the smooth and harmonious running of the programme. Transitions into the centre and across to Arohanui are planned with families to suit children’s individual needs. Within the centre, transitions from the infant area are very well managed.</p><p>The centre’s well considered curriculum is based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers make good use of significant opportunities for professional learning to consider how they can continue to develop the curriculum. Teachers also make good use of local resources, environments and expertise to enhance the programme.</p><p>Te Ao Māori is an intrinsic part of the programme and teachers use a very good level of te reo Māori in their conversations with children. Children demonstrate an understanding of the Māori language that they hear.</p><p>Teachers have used self review to improve the ways they record individual and centre-wide programme planning. They use a variety of useful assessment methods to record children’s learning and development. Teachers could now find ways to better document the strategies used to respond, revisit and extend each child’s learning over time.</p><p>Professional learning for management and staff is valued and purposeful. As a result of recent professional learning and development each staff member is exploring ways to evaluate their own practice. Current centre-wide professional development on leadership is intended to give teachers confidence to undertake leadership roles and build on their strengths.</p><p>Well established governance systems are continually evaluated with the focus on improvements that benefit children and align to current requirements. The centre owner is proactive in seeking advice and guidance. She provides effective leadership and support for the learning and growth of staff. Regular discussions and an updated appraisal process are supporting teachers to become familiar with Education Council requirements and the <em>Practicing Teacher Criteria</em>.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that they could now review the current centre philosophy to ensure it aligns with the language and practices that underpin their ‘heart-centred’ approach.</p><p>As a next step to the development of their reflective practice, teachers could also consider how they could use skills learned to promote reflective practice with children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Harinui Early Childhood Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Harinui Early Childhood Learning Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>28 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
