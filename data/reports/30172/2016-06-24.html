</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>First Steps Waihi provides all day education and care for children from 3 months of age to five years. The centre, located in Waihi East, is licensed for 44 children, including a maximum of ten up to the age of two years. At the time of this ERO review 47 children were enrolled, including six children of Māori descent. The centre has separate age group areas, for babies and toddlers and children from two to five years.</p><p>The centre philosophy embraces the Māori cultural values of manaakitanga (respect), whanaungatanga (belonging), and wananga (knowledge). Priority is placed on learning together, responsiveness to one another's strengths, interests and needs, and the promotion life-long learners in a safe and nurturing environment for learning.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of Best Start Educare, which provides policy guidelines, strategic direction, and financial and business management. Professional guidance and development for staff is provided through appraisal that includes teacher inquiry, internal reviews such as the Quality of Education and Care audit (QEC), and relevant professional learning opportunities. The centre is supported by both the Best Start Business Manager (BM) and the Professional Services Manager (PSM), who work collaboratively to enhance centre leadership to grow teacher capability to implement best practice.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, there have been significant changes to centre leadership. The current centre manager took up her position in July 2015. The centre philosophy has been reviewed, and in response to areas identified for improvement, there has been further development of the environment for learning, and assessment and planning practices. Biculturalism in the curriculum and environment is the current focus for review and development in the centre.</p><p>The centre manager and teaching staff are focussed on building and maintaining positive and reciprocal relationships with the parent community. There has been considerable upgrades to the indoor and outdoor environments, and resourcing to support care and education for babies, toddlers and young children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre receives high levels of support and informed guidance from the Best Start professional services and business managers. Well-developed, self-review systems and procedural guidelines are being introduced and implemented in the centre, leading to a culture of improvement.</p><p>The centre manager benefits from the strong networks within the management/governance structure, and is able to draw on relevant knowledge and expertise to support and guide her in her role. She is working collaboratively with teaching staff to review and consolidate systems and practices, following on from considerable changes to centre leadership in the past three years. Regular feedback from the professional services manager is being well used by the leader to reflect on, and improve practice. Transition to school practices are given careful consideration as part of this centre's commitment to the 'Be School Ready' initiative.</p><p>Self review is now an inclusive process leading to well informed shifts in practice. A clear vision and strategic direction has been set by the team. Teachers have better understanding and ownership of agreed centre priorities for development. Some routines have been modified to allow the programme to flow more easily, and the current review of bicultural practices has been well planned. Using the Best Start framework, teachers are reflecting on indicators of good practice and reaching a shared understanding of how this aspect of the curriculum and environment can be improved.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are benefitting from relevant and ongoing professional development and learning. There are many opportunities for the centre manager to network with other leaders in the organisation and to draw on a wide range of expertise within the organisation. Regular professional learning opportunities are available to teachers, designed to increase their knowledge and understanding in relation to identified priorities in the strategic plan. A recent focus is about intentional teaching strategies in the programme, and the centre leader now recognises the need to align this work with teachers' inquiry into their practice, as part of the appraisal process.</p><p>The centre philosophy has been recently reviewed by the centre leader and teachers, leading to a shared vision and understanding. Teachers are working hard to integrate an agreed set of values into the centre environment and curriculum. Priority is placed on developing and maintaining positive, respectful and reciprocal relationships with children and their families/whānau, and amongst adults in the centre. As part of this process, teachers are finding out about what parents want for their children and using these aspirations to develop group and individual goals. Teachers will continue to consider how best to involve parents and engage them as active partners in their children's education.</p><p>The centre programme reflects an appropriate balance of teacher and child-led activity and learning. Teachers are providing a curriculum that is influenced and informed by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, parent aspirations and the emerging interests and identified needs of individuals and groups. Across the centre, teachers provide an interesting and well-prepared learning environment for children. They are responsive to the emerging interests of children and engage in learning conversations with them as they play. Children are able to move freely about the environment, make choices and follow an interest. Early literacy and numeracy learning is integral to play. Teachers support children to sustain an interest, and add complexity to their play to extend and deepen the learning.</p><p>In the babies and toddlers area, high levels of care and nurture are evident. Early independence is encouraged and children are able to move easily between indoor and outdoor areas as they explore their stimulating and inviting environment. Teachers provide many visual, audial and tactile experiences for them, and engage in conversations in play that model good oral language.</p><p>There is a focus on the use of intentional teaching practice as part of ongoing professional learning and development for teachers. ERO observed examples where teachers were responding to their knowledge of individual needs, parent aspiration and prior learning experience, to provide relevant learning for that child.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Develop and document expectations for teachers that should assist them to enact the key ideas/concepts within the agreed centre philosophy for learning and teaching.</p><p>Continue to consolidate and refine planning and assessment practices:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>thinking about purpose and usefulness at each stage of the process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clarifying expectations about the recording of assessments.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Through the current review of biculturalism, continue to strengthen and embed practices to promote culture, language and identity for Māori.</p><p>Consistently and fully implement performance management, including appraisal, in keeping with Best Start systems and practices, and the requirements of the Education Council.</p><p>As part of centre practice, build on and consolidate an approach to teaching as inquiry that is informed by current theory and research about best practice in an early childhood setting.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of First Steps Waihi completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of First Steps Waihi will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>24 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
