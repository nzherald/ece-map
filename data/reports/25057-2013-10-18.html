</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Clevedon Kidz Early Childhood Centre is a community-based centre affiliated to and supported by the Clevedon Presbyterian Church. The centre provides full day education and care for up to 50 children from three months to four years of age. Three separate age groupings are accommodated in the Nest, Fantail and Tui rooms, and are led by team leaders.</p><p>Programmes are based on Christian principles. Staff have a strong focus on providing support for families and community service. The centre is managed in conjunction with the nearby Clevedon Kidz Get Set 4 School centre for four-year-old children. Teachers at the centre are either qualified early childhood teachers or are in training for a qualification.</p><p>The centre enjoys high levels of community and parent support. Many families have had several children attend the centre and those who have gone on to school frequently return to visit their teachers. Parents are very visible and involved in the centre, and frequently engage in conversations with teachers to keep each other informed about children’s learning and needs.</p><p>The 2010 ERO report recommended that centre managers and staff increase the effectiveness of their self-review, and improve the quality of teaching and programme planning practices. Since that review, centre leaders and teachers have engaged in professional learning and development and have developed templates to guide self-review processes. They have made some progress but have identified the need to further strengthen self-review, programme planning and the quality of teaching.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at Clevedon Kidz Early Childhood Centre are welcomed into the centre by teachers and their friends. They quickly settle and engage in activities. Children demonstrate a good sense of belonging. Teachers prepare activities and make other resources readily available for children to access and make choices about their play. Children benefit from the positive, caring relationships evident between teachers and children.</p><p>The centre’s curriculum is strongly influenced by the centre’s traditions, the Christian philosophy and values, and parental input. Programmes have some alignment with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. To increase this alignment, teachers will need to reconsider the formal teaching that takes place in the mat-time sessions and the ‘Get Set’ programme.</p><p>Programme plans are developed by teachers. They plan topics and a wide variety of activities they believe will interest children. Teachers engage children in good conversations that support their language development while they play and do activities. However, the programme is strongly based on teacher directions, rather than on children’s interests and free play. ERO suggests the centre manager and teachers engage in external professional development to improve teachers’ understanding and centre expectations for better supporting child-initiated, sustained play.</p><p>Children’s portfolios are attractive records of their time at the centre. There are examples of learning stories that effectively record children’s learning, developmental milestones and progress with dispositions. These good examples could be used as models of learning stories to help teachers focus on children’s interests and learning, rather than children’s engagement in teacher-chosen activities.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO report teachers have engaged in ongoing professional development to increase their knowledge and confidence to use te reo and tikanga with children in the programme. They have sought to make connections with local kaumatua and iwi to learn more about local whakapapa and mihi to support their Māori children.</p><p>Babies and toddlers up to two years of age enjoy a calm, responsive environment. Routines are undertaken respectfully, ensuring children feel nurtured and valued. The separate outdoor area for babies and toddlers has recently been significantly improved, giving them more opportunities to be physically active.</p><p>The licensee provides good overall leadership and has a clear understanding of his responsibility to meet the licensing criteria regarding the programme. Good strategic and business management plans and systems are in place to ensure children’s health and safety. A new centre manager, who is well known to the community, has recently been appointed for continuity and to maintain the family ethos of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The licensee, centre manager and ERO agree that next steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>providing a programme that is more responsive to children’s interests, provides more challenge for them and promotes sustained play</li>
<li>reviewing how well all programmes align with current effective early childhood expectations and <em>Te Whāriki</em>.</li>
</ul><p>Centre leaders have identified the need to review the teacher performance management system in order to make it more improvement focussed. This could include:</p><ul>
<li>differentiating appraisals for different teaching positions</li>
<li>undertaking programme observations and providing teachers with documented feedback</li>
<li>incorporating the registered teacher criteria as part of the appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Clevedon Kidz Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Clevedon Kidz Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>18 October 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
