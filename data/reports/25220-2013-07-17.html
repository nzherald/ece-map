</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mangere Bridge Playcentre is a well established centre which operates as a parent-led cooperative and is part of the Auckland Playcentre Association. The centre opens for three half days a week. The children may attend one session per week without their parent or caregiver, as they prepare to transition to school.</p><p>The centre has a strong history of positive ERO reviews. This report affirms that good practices have been maintained. Centre members focus on improvement and have worked diligently to ensure that areas for improvement and progress in the last ERO report were addressed in a timely and appropriate manner.</p><p>The Playcentre philosophy of parents as first teachers is clearly evident. Centre members work together to ensure the Association’s and the centre’s vision and strategic goals are met. A "buddy" system is used as a way of giving support to new members by those who are more experienced.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children know other children and adults well and demonstrate a strong sense of belonging. They are increasingly self-directed and capable learners. There is some good modelling of parents/whānau engaging with children in play and in conversations that extend children’s thinking.</p><p>Tuakana/teina relationships between older children and younger children are a key feature. Infants and toddlers are well cared for. Their care is shared by kind and sensitive adults. Centre members work well together to set up interesting learning environments that support children’s play and learning. Resources are accessible to children and their achievement and milestones are celebrated by all parents/whānau.</p><p>Good quality processes for programme planning and assessment are in place to help provide a responsive programme for children. Centre members use a variety of communication methods to inform each other of upcoming events and to plan for children’s learning programmes. Māori and Pacific children have a strong sense of identity. Bicultural practices are genuine. All cultures are respectfully recognised and celebrated in the programme</p><p>Good quality interactions and rich dialogue support language acquisition for all children. Adults are consistent in their approach to promoting and providing strategies to support the development of children’s interpersonal skills, particularly in relation to conflict resolution. Adults take shared responsibility for supporting children’s learning.</p><p>The centre is well managed by centre members. The Association has good systems in place to support members in implementing and promoting Playcentre values and beliefs as well as centre and Association strategic directions. Strong respectful leadership is valued and is embedded in practice. Good quality practices build centre members’ capacity and shared understandings and help ensure the sustainability of good practices in the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre members agree that key next steps for further improving centre performance are:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to build training levels of members</li>
<li>continuing to foster and develop leadership skills of both adults and children</li>
<li>formally documenting children’s assessments in the portfolios to show progress and continuity of their learning and the follow up on their next learning steps</li>
<li>continuing to develop self-review practices that are meaningful to the playcentre context.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mangere Bridge Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mangere Bridge Playcentre will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>17 July 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
