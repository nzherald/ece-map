</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Howick Baptist Church Kindergarten borders the local shopping complex. It has been in operation for over thirty years. Christian beliefs underpin the centre philosophy. The centre benefits from a stable team of teachers, one of whom was appointed supervisor in 2012. Teachers work collaboratively to provide a range of skills and experience.</p><p>The centre is licensed to provide all day education and care for 40 children from three years to school age. All children attend morning sessions. Afternoon sessions are optional : one is open to all enrolled children and two are extensions sessions for the older children as preparation for going to school. The centre operates out of the Howick Baptist Church complex and is governed by a management team that includes members of the church, centre staff and parents.</p><p>The 2010 ERO report noted warm, positive relationships and interactions between children and teachers. Teachers actively promoted and modelled values of respect and care for others. These affirming features have been sustained and continue to contribute to a welcoming and nurturing environment. The 2010 ERO report recommended that teachers review children’s portfolios and programme plans to formalise their focus on children’s emerging interests. Progress has been made in this area as staff continue to review and improve their practice.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are valued, celebrated and affirmed. They are familiar with their environment and explore and investigate within a carefully structured setting. Children enjoy conversations with their peers and teachers and are able to talk about their own experiences. Teachers promote a learning environment that focuses on developing the whole child.</p><p>Centre programmes reflect <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. The centre’s aim is to nurture and build on each child’s individual abilities and interests and to support independent learning. Parents are encouraged to be part of programme planning. Teachers support bicultural practices and respect the place of Māori as tangata whenua of New Zealand. It could now be helpful for teachers to review the transition to school programme and align this to more effective strategies for teaching children in their early childhood years.</p><p>A model of shared leadership is developing in the centre. The newly appointed supervisor is developing an organisational culture of honouring and harnessing the potential of staff. Teachers are invited to take a leadership role in areas of interest. They are further developing both planned and spontaneous self review in the centre. It is now timely for teachers to reflect critically on their professional practice and to link these reflections to their performance appraisal. The centre has identified that a next step is to align the appraisal process with the Registered Teacher Criteria.</p><p>The centre is continuing to develop effective governance and management practices. The management team is committed to resourcing a range of professional development for teachers and meets regularly to discuss current issues, and to engage in ongoing planning. External advice is sought when needed. Close relationships have been established with families over time.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>During this review the committee chairman and supervisor and ERO agreed there would be value in:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing the centre philosophy and practice to align more closely with the curriculum framework</li>
<li>establishing a vision and strategic plan that informs annual plans and links to performance appraisal</li>
<li>strengthening and extending self-review practices</li>
<li>continuing to develop an improvement-focused organisational culture.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Howick Baptist Church Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Howick Baptist Church Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>28 June 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
