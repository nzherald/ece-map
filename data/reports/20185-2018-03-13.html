</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Our Kids Early Learning Centre - Glen Eden provides full-day and sessional care and education for children from six months to school age. The centre is licensed to provide for 32 children, with a maximum of ten under the age of two years. This centre is one of two owned by the managing director.</p><p>The centre operates from a renovated house. Children of all ages play together. The centre philosophy focuses on relationships and acknowledges the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa, New Zealand. The philosophy emphasises that the role of teachers is to observe and work alongside children to help them co-construct knowledge and to support their developing skills and dispositions.</p><p>The managing director is a qualified early childhood teacher and employs five qualified teachers. Three staff are new to the centre since the 2014 ERO review.</p><p>Good progress has been made in the areas that were identified for improvement in the 2014 ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre warmly welcomes children and their families. Children confidently talk with friends and adults during play and are settled in their environment. They have good opportunities to develop their independence and self-help skills.</p><p>Children spend much of their day in sustained play and exploring. Teachers encourage children's learning and development using a rich curriculum with equipment that encourages creative thinking. Children's development of oral language, and skills and knowledge related to literacy and mathematics, are well supported. Teachers are continuing to review and improve the environment to further promote children's problem solving and opportunities to make discoveries.</p><p>Programme planning and assessment practices and processes are now more focussed on enhancing children's specific dispositions, skills and working theories. Children with additional learning needs receive good collaborative support from teachers, parents and external agencies. Children's learning is shared with their parents through digital portfolios. Centre leaders are seeking to further enhance partnerships with parents by providing opportunities to talk about children's learning, the curriculum and current good teaching practices.</p><p>Staff use internal evaluation to improve outcomes for infants and toddlers. Teachers evaluate the impact of their curriculum decisions to see what difference they are making for the youngest children's learning. They are continuing professional development to implement <em>Te Whariki</em>, <em>The Early Childhood Curriculum,</em> in response to children's dispositions and preferences.</p><p>Teaching is responsive to individual children's needs and teachers make links to children's experiences outside of the centre.</p><p>Teachers are increasing their knowledge of te ao Māori perspectives by participating in professional development. As a result, they are continuing to strengthen bicultural aspects of the curriculum. Centre leaders agree that further priorities are to plan and implement approaches that support success for Māori children, and to develop whānau relationships. These developments could provide insights for planned approaches to support future enrolments of Pacific children and their families.</p><p>A culture of ongoing improvement is well embedded at all levels of the centre. Leaders foster teachers' and parents' shared understanding of the centre philosophy, vision and goals. They consult parents and staff and use their responses to inform strategic planning. Emergent leadership is encouraged and supported using a robust appraisal process. Leaders are strategically improving outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders have identified appropriate priorities for ongoing centre improvement. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing bicultural partnerships through consultation on centre policies and practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to build the collective capacity of the teaching team through curriculum professional development, teaching and leadership as inquiry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to review and improve the learning environment to further promote children's problem solving, exploration and investigation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to maintain a sound policy and review base that responds to changes in requirements and legislation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Our Kids Early Learning Centre - Glen Eden completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should ensure that all excursions, including regular local outings, follow the centre policy for excursions and risk analysis and management.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Our Kids Early Learning Centre - Glen Eden will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>13 March 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
