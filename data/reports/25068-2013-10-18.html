</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidstown Childcare is situated in a large modified house in Mt Wellington, Auckland. The centre provides all day education and care for children from birth to five years old and is licensed for up to 87 children, including 20 children up to two years of age. A small number of children are Māori.</p><p>The centre has three distinct learning areas and children are grouped according to their age. Children up to two and half years old have their own indoor and outdoor areas. The owner has extended the premises to cater for the two and half to three and half year olds, and those over three and half years.</p><p>Since the last ERO review, the teaching team has doubled in size and the licence numbers have grown. Most teachers are qualified and several teachers are new to the centre. The centre leaders are the business owner and two head teachers.</p><p>The 2010 ERO report commented positively on the learning environment, teachers’ responsive relationships with children, and the opportunities provided for uninterrupted play. Recommendations included encouraging parents to contribute more to assessment and planning, and reviewing how well centre operations were supporting the education of Māori children. Some good work to improve performance has been done in these areas since the 2010 review.</p><p>In line with the centre philosophy, children are supported to play and learn within a programme based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The programme allows children to initiate their own learning and follow their own interests.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Kidstown Childcare is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Responsive caregiving supports infants’ and toddlers’ need for strong and secure attachments. Teachers maintain a calm, nurturing environment in which babies and younger children have space and time to lead their learning. There are comfortable, safe spaces that cater for children who are not yet mobile and for those who are crawling and learning to walk.</p><p>Older children have good access throughout the well resourced centre. They mostly engage in simple play activities, selecting from the wide range of choices available to them. Teachers work alongside children and support them in their play. Children have opportunities for imaginative, sustained play with their peers. They can move between rooms, interacting with those in other age groups. This helps children to make successful transitions into and through the centre. Transition processes with local schools is an area that can be further developed.</p><p>A core curriculum based on monthly topics underpins the programme. Teachers also focus on an emerging curriculum and have developed planning that is responsive to the interests of groups and individual children. This more child-focused planning helps to further support children to be confident, self-managing learners.</p><p>Portfolios are good records of children’s participation in the programme and show the learning that happens in play. Parents’ contributions to these are becoming increasingly evident. Teachers could now consider exploring how they might reflect children’s language, culture and identity in portfolios.</p><p>Self review is becoming established with clear purpose and procedures to guide ongoing improvement. Parents and whānau have opportunities to contribute to self review. The centre’s philosophy has recently been reviewed and is underpinned by shared values and beliefs. It would be useful to regularly revisit how well the goals of the philosophy are translated into practice. This should help to ensure that the programme is delivering the quality learning experiences intended.</p><p>An external facilitator is providing good quality professional support to the teaching team, including the provisionally registered teachers. Teachers have opportunities to meet and develop shared understandings about aspects of the programme and self review.</p><p>The learning environment appropriately reflects the recent review of te reo and tikanga Māori. Teachers are at the early stages of developing their skills and confidence to use te reo Māori as part of the programme. Staff should explore current Ministry of Education and ERO resources to improve their knowledge and understanding of this kaupapa.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre owner agree that key next steps for Kidstown Childcare include:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing portfolio content to ensure that children’s next learning steps are documented and followed up on</li>
<li>reviewing the purpose and quality of the extension programme for older children against literature on best practice and guidelines in <em>Te Whāriki</em></li>
<li>linking teacher performance management systems to the registered teacher criteria.</li>
</ul><p>ERO and the centre owner also agree it would be useful to set higher level strategic goals to underpin centre direction and reflect the centre’s well articulated philosophy. Evaluating the impact of these goals on promoting ongoing improvement in the centre should strengthen provision for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidstown Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice centre managers should ensure that records of regular fire and earthquake evacuations are maintained.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidstown Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>18 October 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
