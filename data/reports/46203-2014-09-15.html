</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Carterton Preschool Littlies is located in Carterton. It is a new centre owned and operated by three experienced, registered early childhood teachers. It caters for up to 30 children aged from birth to three years. The day-to-day running of the centre is the responsibility of the team leader.</p><p>The centre provides mixed-age learning areas to meet the developmental needs of younger children. The philosophy is evident in practice. A primary caregiving system enables children to develop secure attachments.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy focuses on warm responsive and respectful interactions to support children’s sense of belonging. Children and parents are warmly welcomed on arrival. Parents spend time settling their children with the support of teachers. A home-like atmosphere prevails.</p><p>Children learn in a happy and secure environment. Routines are calm, unhurried and responsive to the needs of children. Independence and self-help skills are encouraged. Choices for children are highly evident. Teachers use routines as learning opportunities.</p><p>The centre philosophy and curriculum are guided by <em>Te Whāriki</em> the early childhood curriculum. Teachers notice, recognise and respond to children’s emerging interests. Ongoing discussion guides programme planning. There is an established procedure for assessing children’s learning. Teachers agree they should continue to develop assessment practices to show the breadth and complexity of children’s learning over time.</p><p>Teachers know the children and their families well. They engage in conversation with the children as they play and offer support and encouragement. Language development and a love of books are fostered.</p><p>Teachers are developing their confidence to use te reo Māori for instruction and during routines. Leaders have acknowledged the need to continue to develop staff bicultural practices.</p><p>Children lead their own learning. They have easy access to a good range of resources appropriate to their ages and stages of development. Natural resources are integrated. These provide opportunities for children to develop early mathematical concepts of colour, shape, size and capacity.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively to support children’s learning. Ongoing communication ensures the needs of children are responded to as they move within and between the indoor and outdoor spaces.</p><p>Positive relationships with parents, families and outside agencies and well-planned transitions support the inclusion of children with special education needs.</p><p>Leadership is supportive and focused on providing high quality education and care provision for children. Parents are regularly consulted and contribute to the programme and centre operations.</p><p>Teachers have access to a wide range of professional learning and development to strengthen their practice. It is now timely to better align this to staff appraisal and the strategic direction of the centre.</p><p>Self review is beginning to inform decision making. Leaders recognised that self review is at early stages of development. Strengthening teachers’ knowledge and understanding of the purpose of self review and how the process can be used to support ongoing centre developments should improve outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management, staff and ERO agree on the following next steps, to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>continue to strengthen teachers’ knowledge and understanding of self review and evaluation</li>
<li>continue to develop staff bicultural practices</li>
<li>align professional development to appraisal and strategic priorities</li>
<li>continue to review how easily children can independently access toilet facilities.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Carterton Preschool Littlies completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice the centre management should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>a record of all medicine given to children left in the care of the service includes evidence of parent acknowledgement.<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS28]</em></li>
</ul><p>Since the on-site phase of the review, the centre has provided ERO with additional information to show that steps have been taken to address this non-compliance.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Carterton Preschool Littlies will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>15 September 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
