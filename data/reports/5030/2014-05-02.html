</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bairds Kindergarten, in Otara, is located in the grounds of Bairds Mainfreight School. It provides very good quality education and care for up to 30 children from two years old to school age. Families have the option of enrolling their children for six add and a half hour days.</p><p>There have been changes to the teaching team since the last ERO review in 2011. The head teacher has established himself in the role since his appointment in 2011 and is well supported by a long serving teacher. A third experienced teacher joined the team in 2014. Teachers are looking forward to consolidating as a team, and to continuing to serve, and be guided by, their Māori and Pacific communities.</p><p>Bairds Kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA) and operates within the policies and management framework of this organisation.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children confidently interact with each other and with adults and are able to engage in sustained conversations. A sense of pride is evident in the way children care for equipment, and this sense of caring is passed down to children who are newer to the centre. There is an atmosphere of inclusiveness, respectfulness and belonging.</p><p>Children experience a richly resourced and well organised environment where they explore and sustain their play. The wide variety of carefully selected equipment encourages children to play creatively and imaginatively. In addition teachers support children's complex play through their skilful questioning.</p><p>Children are confident with digital technologies. They use computers, tablets and other tools to explore and support their literacy and numeracy learning. They are supported to use technology as a research tool. Books are celebrated and held in high regard and are seen as an important tool for learning.</p><p>Very good assessment and portfolio practices are evident. Learning portfolios are developed for each child and are available to children and parents. Visual recordings are a key part of learning portfolios and help show parents what is happening in the programme. Teachers continue to explore ways to link planning to children’s emergent interests and to make this visible for parents.</p><p>Teachers respond to, and are respectful of, children’s needs and the curriculum is strongly child driven. They use bicultural and multicultural knowledge, values and home languages to support children. Teachers know their children and families and whānau well.</p><p>Teachers, parents and children enjoy good relationships with the adjacent school. The kindergarten is invited to share in appropriate school events and processes for transitioning children to school have been developed together with the school. Teachers share their knowledge of children’s learning and experiences to help them make a smooth and enjoyable start at school.</p><p>The head teacher shows strong professional and cultural leadership. He has established respectful partnerships with families and, along with the teaching team, shows skills and a high level of commitment to providing children with good foundations for lifelong learning.</p><p>The kindergarten, through an AKA initiative, is currently exploring ways to further encourage families to ensure their children participate and engage in early learning. Teachers are working with AKA managers to explore options for providing health care and transport for children. The teaching team is well supported by the AKA professional services manager (PSM), and the association more generally, to progress improvements that will strengthen the quality outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers, the PSM and ERO agree that key next steps for the kindergarten should include:</p><ul>
<li>ensuring that the centre philosophy reflects the high level practices in the kindergarten</li>
<li>continuing to build a collaborative and cohesive teaching team</li>
<li>strengthening self review by better analysing information to identify the impact of practice on teaching and on children’s learning.</li>
</ul><p>The 2014 review of the AKA strategic plan should provide an effective way for kindergarten staff to contribute to the ongoing development of the association.  </p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bairds Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve the quality of current provisions, the kindergarten should work to improve children’s access to shade protection in the outdoor area.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Bairds Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>2 May 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
