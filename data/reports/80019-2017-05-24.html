</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Longbush Rural Kindergarten is situated close to Invercargill in a small rural community. The kindergarten is open from 8:30am to 2:30pm. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 40 children. Thirty children attend in the mornings and twenty in the afternoons. Children come from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds, including a number of children for whom English is a second language.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by Kindergartens South (KS). The kindergarten receives regular support from senior teachers. Since the 2014 ERO review there has been a number of staff changes. There is now a new head teacher and teacher. After the 2014 ERO review senior teachers supported the teachers to develop action planning to address the key next steps. The new team have continued to address the key next steps, however, these remain key priorities for development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of fourteen kindergarten reviews in the Southland Kindergarten Association (trading as Kindergartens South).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The new head teacher and team are working well together to support positive outcomes for children. They have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>created a strong sense of whanaungatanga for children and their families</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improved practice through participating in a research programme that encourages close and careful listening to children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a view of children as confident and competent learners that positively influences the programme.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The teachers have developed a shared team-teaching philosophy to guide their work. This should be further developed, in consultation with the community, to include the desired outcomes for children's learning.</p><p>Children experience a varied and localised curriculum based on the principles and strands of Te Whāriki (the early childhood curriculum). Children have many opportunities for early literacy (including ICT), mathematics, science and developing skills to relate positively with each other.</p><p>Teachers make good use of the outdoor environment to enable children to connect with nature, explore, think and be curious. Teachers skilfully use regular visits to the nearby kindergarten farm as a context to build children's knowledge of themselves as caretakers of Papatūānuku and learn about New Zealand's bicultural heritage. Children actively lead their play, follow their interests and know their ideas are listened to and built on.</p><p>The teaching team have developed new systems for planning, assessment and evaluation. These need further development to be effective. When planning for groups and individuals, teachers need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>consistently gather and show in documentation how they respond to parents' wishes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>show how they value and respond to children's language, culture and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify the desired outcomes for children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make clear the strategies and experiences to support these outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies and experiences in supporting children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers need to continue to find ways to improve assessment practices to show Māori children are actively engaged in their learning and are progressing well and succeeding as Māori.</p><p>The new head teacher and teaching team, in consultation with the community, have thoughtfully developed long-term planning with key priorities for development to support positive outcomes for children. The key priorities are that children:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>have a strong connection to the natural and living world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>know their culture is valued and integrated into the programmes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have a wide range of technologies to explore and make sense of their world in real and meaningful ways</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are well supported as they transition to school.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The kindergarten does not have action planning in place to achieve these key priorities. The cultural diversity of the children who attend the kindergarten is not well reflected and integrated into programmes. Action planning needs to be developed for the key priorities and should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ongoing monitoring of the plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regular evaluation and reporting on the outcomes to the community and KS.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The head teacher has identified that internal evaluation is an area for improvement. The team need to improve their understanding and practice of effective internal evaluation.</p><p>The kindergarten benefits from well-planned and ongoing professional learning and development and is well supported by the senior teachers. A new appraisal system is being introduced, further development is required to include expectations for observations and explicit links to Tātaiako.</p><p>The kindergarten receives good support from KS. The KS board has a clear strategic vision that outlines key priorities for development. The next step is to ensure explicit alignment of these priorities to the planning of each kindergarten. The board has identified that internal evaluation practice is not strong at board level. The board needs to receive evaluative reporting of how well these plans and other initiatives have been enacted and the impact on children’s learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps to promote positive outcomes for all children are for the head teacher and teachers with the support of the senior teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>refocus the philosophy and use it to evaluate the effectiveness of programmes and practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop systems for planning, monitoring and evaluation of the key priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embed appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop and use effective internal evaluation practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The key next steps to promote positive outcomes for all children are for the board to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure the appraisal system continues to be developed and embedded</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and use rigorous internal evaluation practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure explicit alignment of kindergarten planning to implement the KS strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>receive evaluative reporting of progress towards the strategic goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Longbush Rural Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to: </p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Longbush Rural Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>24 May 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
