</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Punahau Early Childhood Care Centre is a stand-alone early learning service located in Levin. It is licensed for 15 tamariki, including seven up to two years of age. Of the 19 children enrolled, 18 are Māori. The centre opens for mixed-age sessions, five days a week.</p><p>A new licensee and programme manager have been appointed since the October 2015 ERO report. The programme manager oversees the day-to-day operation and provides professional leadership to the teaching team. Most permanent staff are qualified teachers. One teacher is working towards registration.</p><p>The centre philosophy draws upon the whakatauki; 'Ko te manu e kai ana i te miro, nona te ngahere. Ko te manu e kai ana I te matauranga, nona te Ao'. Tamariki are prepared and provided with opportunities to develop their potential so they too can have the world.</p><p>Ngāi Te Ao Incorporated Trust forms the governance. The trust includes representatives from Ngai Te Ao hapū and Punahau Early Childhood Care Centre whānau and staff. Leaders and teachers have connected links and working relationships with Muaūpoko iwi and Ngāi Te Ao hapū.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified aspects requiring further development. These included: developing indicators of quality practice linked to the philosophy; self review; and appraisal. Progress against the philosophy and self review are evident. A new appraisal process has been introduced.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Punahau Early Childhood Care Centre's philosophy is highly evident in practice. Tamariki are guided by the principles of manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, taikitanga, ukaipotanga, mana reo rua and mana tikanga. These are experienced through tuakana teina interactions, collaborative learning, positive respectful relationships and affirming learning outcomes.</p><p>Tamariki are viewed as capable, competent achievers. Tamariki, whānau and staff know each other well, forming a strong relational base.</p><p>Tamariki actively engage and explore through a range of planned and spontaneous experiences linked to identified goals responsive to their preferences, interests and needs. These include Muaūpoko iwi and Ngāi Te Ao hapū events. Literacy, mathematics, science, te ao Māori, music and creative opportunities are progressing children's language, knowledge and understanding.</p><p>Leaders and teachers acknowledge whakapapa as integral to the development of a sense of self, belonging and connectedness. Centre teachers successfully promote a kaupapa Māori learning environment. The curriculum includes tamaiti connections to their cultural identity. Tamariki learn about hapū and iwi history, sites of significance and kawa. These are incorporated into the programme in meaningful and respectful ways. Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are woven through tamariki daily learning experiences.</p><p>The planning and evaluation framework for individuals and groups includes parent and whānau aspirations. Some learning stories show depth, breadth of learning experiences, continuity and progression over time. Tamaiti voice is gathered and highlighted in the narratives. Learning stories assessment incorporates <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. A next step is to strengthen the evaluative aspects of the programme planning to identify the impact of the teaching and learning for tamariki.</p><p>Infants and toddlers experience care and a responsive curriculum grounded in te ao Māori values and beliefs.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well catered for and supported. Suitable strategies are used to promote learning and participation. The centre has good relationships with external agencies who are involved as needed.</p><p>The centre has well-considered transition processes into the centre and on to school.</p><p>Leaders have introduced a new annual appraisal process. To improve centre practices all aspects of appraisal need to be implemented. These should include: goal setting; targeted observations linked to teachers' goals; meetings; teaching as inquiry; professional development impact on teaching; feedback/feedforward and an annual summary. A next step is for teachers to build further capability to evaluate their own progress against set goals.</p><p>Management, governance and established communication systems support the centre's improvement-focused practice.</p><p>Centre leaders should continue to build knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation to guide improvement. This includes further developing and using the current framework for practice, to assist all teachers to know about the impact of actions on outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Strengthening the shared understanding of evaluation should assist further development in planning, assessment, curriculum, appraisal and strategic goal setting, for ongoing improvement to children's learning and care.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Punahau Early Childhood Care Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Since the on-site phase of the ERO evaluation the side front fence has been rebuilt to secure the premises for children.</p><h3>Action for Compliance</h3><ol>
<li>Leaders should ensure that suitable human resource management practices are implemented and meet requirements of the Vulnerable Children Act 2014<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and care Centres 2008, GMA7A]</em></li>
</ol><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Punahau Early Childhood Care Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>11 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
