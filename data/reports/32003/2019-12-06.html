</table><p>Mangatangi &amp; Districts Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mangatangi &amp; Districts Playcentre changed its name from Kaiaua/Miranda Playcentre following the May 2016 ERO report. The playcentre is a parent-cooperative early childhood service. It is located in a rural setting adjacent to Mangatangi School. The service is licensed for 30 children, including 10 children up to two years of age. The playcentre is currently open for two mixed-aged morning sessions per week.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review, the centre has responded well to the key next steps in the report through the support of the bicultural officer.</p><p>During 2018 and 2019, Playcentre transitioned from operating as a federation, with 32 regional associations that were individual legal entities, to becoming one national body, Playcentre Aotearoa. This was legally amalgamated in June 2019. Six new regional offices are moving to streamline and standardise support across the country. The Central North Island Region was created in November 2017 when eight associations merged. It covers a large geographical area with a total of 94 centres, both urban and rural.</p><p>The governing body has recently appointed a centre support worker and centre administrator to provide support for the parent-led committee of members at Mangatangi Playcentre. Parent members fill the key committee roles at the playcentre.</p><p>Through its national philosophy, Playcentre Aotearoa places emphasis on 'whānau tupu ngātahi – families growing together'. They empower adults and children to play, work and grow together and value and affirm parents as first and best educators of their children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews in the Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families mutually benefit from the knowledge and interests that they bring to the centre. Children’s interests are affirmed and extended in a well-resourced and print-rich environment. Their learning is valued and attractively displayed on the walls. Children are encouraged to be confident and independent learners. They have many opportunities to explore, take risks and problem solve. Learning about science is deliberate and well-integrated in the programme, enriching children’s learning.</p><p>Māori children are affirmed in their culture and identity. Early concepts of literacy and numeracy are promoted in dual languages of English and te reo Māori. Support and guidance from the bicultural officer continue to build practice in this area. Significant landmarks of the local hapū and a shared marae visit support a localised place-based curriculum. Children demonstrate a strong sense of mana whenua at the centre.</p><p>Children up to two years of age are well supported by their parents, older children and other familiar adults. Home routines are responded to and children's stages of development are nurtured.</p><p>Trusting relationships and high adult-to-child ratios support learning outcomes for children. Ongoing training and development by some members promotes respectful practice. Further developing a shared understanding of positive guidance across the centre should support consistency of practice.</p><p>Playcentre families maintain supportive and reciprocal relationships with the local school and community. A strong relationship with the local school supports children’s transitions.</p><p>Children have attractively presented portfolios. Parent aspirations and individual 'learner maps' support planning. Aspects of intentionally planned activities and some examples of continuity of learning over time are evident. Documenting the contribution of multiple voices and learning outcomes in children's assessment stories is likely to strengthen these processes. Support from the new centre support worker and involvement in adult training is assisting members to further strengthen their knowledge of New Zealand's early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki</em>.</p><p>Collaborative leadership, based on relational trust and open communication, fosters a team culture for learning and development. Some committee roles are co-facilitated to share the workload. To build capacity, leaders share their knowledge and experience with new members and actively support and encourage participation.</p><p>Knowledge and understanding of self-review and internal evaluation and how this contributes to developing high quality practice and outcomes for children is not well developed. Playcentre Aotearoa should provide support to members to build their understanding and use of self-review and evaluation.</p><p>During the transition period, there is some overlap between associations and the new national or regional systems and processes. National policies and an online management tool are currently being delivered throughout the new region. Management need to ensure that support is in place for local centres to fully implement these. A revised adult education training course has recently been offered across the region to support adults grow their capabilities and knowledge. The overarching strategic plan, philosophy and vision of Playcentre Aotearoa, and individual centre annual plans, have been implemented and guide direction.</p><p>A particular strength of Playcentre Aotearoa is the two-house model initiative for governance. Te Whare Tikanga Māori promotes self-determination for Māori members. This national initiative is yet to impact on practice for Māori learners at Mangatangi Playcentre, as members continue to strengthen bicultural practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for Mangatangi Playcentre are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review and strengthen sustainability of bicultural practice across the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation that, incorporates learning outcomes and make visible extension of children's learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve understanding and use of self-review and internal evaluation to support improved outcomes for all children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>New support and professional development is in place for the centre. Those in governance and local members should continue to strengthen their relationships and align systems and processes to the new national directives.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mangatangi &amp; Districts Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to health and safety practices. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas and ensure:</p><ul>
<li>that furniture, specifically the stereo, is secured or placed at a level that will avoid causing injury</li>
<li>hazards to the safety of children are eliminated, isolated or minimised, specifically electrical sockets covered</li>
<li>the annual review of emergency plan is undertaken</li>
<li>children are able to access drinking water independently</li>
<li>a clear procedure is available to ensure the water quality from the water tank is safe to drink.</li>
</ul><p><i>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008; HS6, HS7, HS12, HS21]</i></p><p>Since the onsite stage of the review the service has provided evidence of the steps they have taken to address the procedure for ensuring water quality; covering of electrical sockets and securing of the stereo in the children's play space.</p><h3>To improve current compliance practice:</h3><p>The early childhood service management should ensure:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>accurate and improved record keeping that is aligned to the revised Playcentre Aotearoa policies, particularly in relation to the following: sleep records; evaluating fire drills; and recording ratios on excursions out of the centre. Positive guidance and child protection policies should also be reviewed and updated.</p>
</li>

ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"> <i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
