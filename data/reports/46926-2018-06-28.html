</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mountainside Educare is a privately-owned education and care service. It has been open for two years and this is its first ERO report. The purpose-built centre is well designed to take advantage of natural light and indoor-outdoor flow.</p><p>Mountainside is licensed for 40 children up to school age, including up to 10 children under two years of age. Children learn and play in a mixed-age environment, with provision for older children to work in a side room. A centre manager provides overall centre leadership, and also has teaching responsibilities. All teachers are qualified.</p><p>The philosophy is based on the principles of relationships, respect and communication. Teachers endeavour to provide a high-quality education and care centre that is a home-away-from-home experience.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children show a strong sense of belonging to their centre. Records of learning show that children make good progress against their individual learning priorities and the centre's priorities. Planning for individual children:</p><ul>
<li>is responsive to children's current needs and development stages</li>
<li>is firmly based on the centre's learning priorities</li>
<li>guides authentic learning that is based on parents' aspirations, and what teachers have noticed about children's interests and development.</li>
</ul><p>Children's progress is well tracked, shared with parents and whānau, and used to inform children's next learning directions. Teachers regularly evaluate the overall progress children are making over time.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have a growing commitment to providing an environment that includes Māori language and culture. The mixed-age group effectively supports the values of tuakana-teina/older supporting younger, manaakitanga/caring and whanaungatanga/relationships.</p><p>Teachers have caring and respectful relationships with the children and their whānau. They are nurturing and responsive to infants' needs and actions. The well-thought-out physical environment provides strongly for children's emotional and physical wellbeing, and their intellectual stimulation. The centre is strategic in its staffing to ensure good attachments and relationships. Children under two have strong secure attachments with their teachers.</p><p>Leaders use effective systems to build collective capacity amongst staff and sustainability within the centre. The useful long-term planning is carefully aligned to the centre's vision and philosophy. The strategic plan is thoughtfully set out to ensure good use and understanding of what is to be done, why, and by when.</p><p>Teachers are empowered to take responsibility for their own professional growth through the centre's well-designed appraisal process. Leaders and teachers effectively identify what is going well, and what would benefit from further improvement through the internal evaluation practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers need to formally evaluate the impact of their teaching practices as part of their individual reflections and to inform the centre's overall review findings.</p><p>To know how well the centre is achieving its philosophy and learning priorities, leaders and teachers should extend their internal evaluation to incorporate relevant aspects of these key documents into review topics.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mountainside Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">Next ERO Review</span></h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mountainside Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>28 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
