</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Aro Valley Community Preschool is situated in central Wellington. It is a not-for-profit service led by a parent cooperative. A parent committee oversees governance and management.</p><p>The preschool opens Monday to Friday from 8:30am until 2:30pm. It offers full and half day places for children aged two to five years. Many children on the roll are new to New Zealand and are English language learners.</p><p>A new philosophy guides the programme. It stresses the importance of learning through play and of building a caring learning community.</p><p>The April 2015 ERO report, identified a number of areas for review and development. These included: assessment, planning and evaluation for children's learning; teacher appraisal; internal evaluation; bicultural practices; and teachers' response to supporting Māori children's culture, language and identity. The report also identified a need for the preschool to improve its performance in meeting regulatory requirements. In response to these concerns, teachers and committee members have undertaken a programme of professional learning and development.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review, there have been changes in the teaching team. A new senior teacher was appointed in February 2016.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Committee members, teachers and leaders worked collaboratively in response to the areas for development and review in the previous ERO report. Most concerns have been addressed. Internal evaluation has developed and now requires further strengthening.</p><p>The centre philosophy is strongly evident in practice. Children benefit from a curriculum that nurtures their sense of belonging. Teachers model respectful relationships and positive skills. Children share and collaborate. They show care and concern for one another.</p><p>Warm relationships with families are evident. Teachers and parents plan experiences that respond to children's emerging interests. Assessment practices identify children's learning and their relationships with people and places. Teachers are continuing to develop assessment practices by strengthening consistency across the teaching team.</p><p>Children's connections to their cultural identities are successfully extended. With their parents, they lead cultural celebrations and share language knowledge. Teachers show a shared commitment to bicultural practices. Te reo Māori is woven naturally throughout the programme. Māori children and whānau lead tikanga Māori.</p><p>Children and whānau are warmly welcomed into the centre in a gradual, unhurried manner. They are encouraged to settle at their own pace. A useful range of strategies supports older children and families as they prepare for their move to school.</p><p>Children with additional needs play and learn alongside their friends. Teachers work with families and external agencies to meet individual learning goals. Their responsiveness to children's wellbeing is evident.</p><p>Committee members, leaders and teachers have a strong commitment to ongoing improvement. Teacher appraisal is established and continues to be refined. There is a well-planned and deliberate focus on supporting continual professional growth.</p><p>The senior teacher has a well-considered approach to leading her new team. She encourages teachers' individual interests and fosters their emerging leadership skills. A shared understanding of curriculum requirements and teaching practice expectations is evident.</p><p>Self review for improvement is ongoing and has led to some positive changes. The focus for internal evaluation should now progress from how teachers can solve a problem to how well the curriculum and teaching practices are supporting improved outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>The senior teacher, committee members and ERO agree, that the following key next step for Aro Valley Community Preschool is for staff to continue to strengthen internal evaluation practices. </p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Aro Valley Community Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Aro Valley Community Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>14 March 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p><p style="display: inline !important;" align="right">r</p>
