</table><p>BestStart Havelock North is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>BestStart Havelock North (previously known as ABC Havelock North) operates Monday to Friday from 7.45 am until 5.15 pm and is licensed for 25 children over the age of two. The current roll of 31, includes five children who identify as Māori.</p><p>Families attend from Havelock North and the wider community. Centre staffing remains consistent. The majority of teachers are qualified. A centre chef provides daily meals to meet the nutritional and cultural needs of children. The service philosophy encompasses the development of: respectful relationships; cultural identity; wairua, positive guidance; self-regulation; active learning within a programme that empowers children to explore and inquire into their learning.</p><p>BestStart Havelock North operates under the national umbrella of BestStart Educare Ltd, that owns centres throughout New Zealand. BestStart policies and procedures guide operation and provide business management services. Since the October 2015 ERO report, a new business manager and a professional services manager have been appointed to provide support for curriculum development and delivery.</p><p>The service has sustained and improved on the good practice identified in the previous ERO evaluation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A clear vision sets the direction for the service. The philosophy is highly evident in practice, documentation, assessment and in the curriculum. This is underpinned by strong, reciprocal relationships that are responsive to the needs of its learning community. Parents, whānau and children are made to feel welcome and valued. Their cultures are celebrated.</p><p>A calm, inviting environment successfully encourages children's exploration, investigation and curiosity. Attentive teachers interact positively with children and extend their working theories, interests and projects. Extensive planning, photo walls and learning portfolios show children as competent and capable learners.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively with parents and external agencies to provide additional learning support for diverse learners. Effective teaching strategies help children to self-regulate their emotions. Early literacy and rich language experiences are integrated within a highly inclusive setting.</p><p>Children benefit from a wide range of opportunities to experience te reo Māori me ngā tikanga Māori. Te ao Māori is strongly reflected across the curriculum. Waiata, karakia and stories depicting local iwi are meaningfully included. The bicultural curriculum is extended through regular cultural celebrations and family events. Teachers continue to be guided by whānau Māori to deepen their understanding of what success looks like for their children and respond appropriately.</p><p>Group planning is well established and shows how adults facilitate learning to promote children's interests across the breadth of the curriculum. A range of assessment tools provides a clear picture of who the child is, what they like and how they learn. ERO affirms the services current focus on the use of children's cultural contexts and parent aspirations to inform individual planning. This should further support teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of the enacted curriculum and teaching strategies to progress learning.</p><p>A well-considered transition-to-school process is in place. Reciprocal relationships and visits between the school and the centre enable teachers to share relevant information about children's learning as they move on to school.</p><p>BestStart guiding policies and procedures are consistently implemented to meet licensing requirements. A clear focus on achieving the service's identified priorities is evident throughout all levels of operation. Teachers are highly reflective and work collaboratively within a professional learning culture that promotes high quality education and care.</p><p>Systematic self review and evaluation leads to improved outcomes for children. Internal evaluation, that is focused and useful, should continue to provide leaders, teachers, parents and whānau with sound information about the effectiveness of the curriculum. Further evaluating the impact of initiatives to see what is working well and who for, should further support the team to identify and target specific areas for ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders agree that aspects of internal evaluation require strengthening. The service has the capacity to do this to sustain and continue to improve positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of BestStart Havelock North completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>17 September 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
