</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>TopKids Mangere East 1 is licensed to provide education and care for 150 children, including up to 40 aged under two years. It serves a diverse multicultural community. Children are cared for in four age-related groups in adjoining rooms.</p><p>The centre was previously part of the Kiwicare group, which was purchased by BestStart in July 2013. At the time of the 2015 ERO report, this centre was known as Kiwicare Tennessee 1. The centre is part of a complex, alongside TopKids Mangere East 2, which is licensed for 100 children over two years of age. Around the age of three-and-a-half, children transition through to the area for older children.</p><p>A complex manager and two centre managers have been appointed since the 2015 ERO report. Eight other qualified teachers, two teachers in training, and four unqualified teachers complete the teaching team for Licence 1.</p><p>The centre's philosophy strongly values relationships with whānau and children. It celebrates cultural diversity and inclusiveness. Teaching teams aim to work with whanau, community and local agencies to achieve positive and equitable outcomes for children.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report noted that teachers supported children's play well. Areas for ongoing development were extending the complexity of children's play and opportunities for exploration and challenge in the environment. Next steps also included management plans, self review and appraisal. There has been good progress in these areas.</p><p>The centre is part of the BestStart Education and Care organisation. BestStart provides an overarching governance and management framework as well as personnel to support operations and curriculum in individual centres. A business manager and a professional services manager are highly involved in the staff professional development and strategic guidance.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews in the Upper North Island (UNI) BestStart region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from nurturing relationships with adults. They are encouraged to be independent explorers and make discoveries from a good range of accessible resources. Children move freely between the indoor and outdoor environments and engage in sustained, purposeful play that supports their learning and development. Children are curious and adventurous.</p><p>Respectful, responsive caregiving supports infants’ and toddlers’ need for secure attachments and developing independence. Teachers maintain a calm, relaxed environment in which very young children have space and time to explore and play. Children are caring, considerate and accepting of others.</p><p>Teachers foster a strong sense of belonging in all children. They recognise and build on children's strengths. Teachers support children’s ideas and preferences. They ensure the programme is inclusive of all children, including those with diverse needs.</p><p>Children's cultural heritages are affirmed well by teachers, throughout the programme. Teachers and leaders promote bicultural practices, including te reo Māori, and children experience cultural practices that are unique to Aotearoa New Zealand. These good practices support the pride that Māori children and whānau have in their language and cultural identity.</p><p>Children from diverse backgrounds speak their home languages confidently, and have access to resources, displays and play experiences that reflect their various cultures. Pacific children and families are well supported. Children engage in Pacific celebrations, art, music and dance, with pride and enthusiasm.</p><p>Children learn in an attractive and well-resourced learning environment that invites and sustains children’s engagement in play. There is a strong focus on natural resources and equipment. Teachers foster children’s understanding of literacy, mathematics and science. Children are able to be imaginative, creative and physically active in the carefully organised outdoor areas.</p><p>Teachers plan and implement a play based programme, which is underpinned by the centre's philosophy, bicultural practices, parent aspirations and <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Individual planning reflects the child's strengths and dispositions and teachers are exploring ways to align these aspects with group planning. Children’s assessment portfolios are valued records of learning and development with some including whānau contributions. Electronic portfolios are increasing opportunities for parents and whānau to know about and contribute to their children’s learning.</p><p>Centre leaders and staff look for ways to involve parents and whānau and make connections with the local community. Parents/whānau are encouraged to join in, share ideas and provide feedback. Recent surveys suggest high levels of parent satisfaction and appreciation.</p><p>Leaders promote a collegial and collaborative workplace culture. They show respect for teachers as valued professionals, and provide professional learning and leadership opportunities. A meaningful appraisal system connects teachers' goals to strategic plans and professional learning.</p><p>Internal evaluation is well established, influences decision making and reflects leaders' strong focus on continual improvement. Leaders are aware that deeper reflection and evaluation would help to lift teaching practice and contribute to more positive outcomes for children's learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Centre operations are guided by a strategic plan, annual plan and a shared vision. These are linked to BestStart strategic goals, which promotes a sense of belonging to a wider learning community and supports more widespread collaboration amongst teaching teams. Continued revisiting of the goals of the centre's strategic and annual plans is enabling leaders and teachers to monitor quality and promote ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that next steps for ongoing improvement include embedding and building on new initiatives and good practices, including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers' skills and strengths to enrich learning programmes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the partnerships that teachers and leaders have with Māori and Pacific whānau, and documenting parent contributions to planning and assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers' critique of their own practice, and their evaluation of children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation that involves deeper evaluative analysis and focuses on the effectiveness and impact of teachers' practices on outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of TopKids Mangere East 1 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of TopKids Mangere East 1 will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>22 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
