</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waiwhetu Kindergarten provides all day education and care for up to 43 children, aged over two years. Sessions run daily during the week from 8.30am to 2.30pm. Of the total roll of 57, three children identify as Māori and four are of Pacific heritage. The kindergarten serves a culturally diverse community.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy emphasises inclusive, responsive relationships and learning through play.</p><p>At the time of the review a relieving head teacher was supporting the long-serving teaching team. A permanent head teacher has been appointed and will take up the position at the start of Term 4, 2018. All teachers at Waiwhetu Kindergarten are fully qualified.</p><p>Waiwhetu Kindergarten is one of 19 in the Lower Hutt region, governed and managed by Hutt City Kindergarten Association (the association). Since the September 2015 ERO report, a new senior leadership team has been appointed. This includes a general manager and two senior teachers, guided by a team leader. The governance board has also undergone significant changes.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified the following key next steps: revising and implementing the philosophy; evaluating the effectiveness of the literacy programme; strengthening assessment practice; and learning partnerships with whānau and aiga. Progress has been made in addressing these.</p><p>Practices requiring development were identified for the association. These included: strategic planning; cultural responsiveness to Māori and Pacific families; evaluation; and the appraisal process. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>This review was one of nine in the Hutt City Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play freely in the thoughtfully designed environments. The outdoor area invites them to engage closely with nature. Children from a diverse range of backgrounds play together cooperatively and creatively. Opportunities to initiate, choose and extend activities enable them to sustain and add complexity to their learning. Empowering children to develop social competencies is an acknowledged parent and whānau aspiration and a focus for teacher planning. The child-led curriculum is a kindergarten strength.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to individual children’s interests, discoveries and needs. Intentionally weaving these throughout the programme engages children and gives an authentic context to learning. Teachers learn and play alongside children and are alert to opportunities to engage in rich conversations, model social strategies and extend thinking.</p><p>New children and families from all cultures are welcomed. Teachers know children and families well. Teachers encourage parents and whānau to contribute to their children’s learning journeys through actively seeking their aspirations and perspectives. Useful information about cultural and home contexts is gathered and contributes to building strong, positive relationships.</p><p>Well-chosen learning stories are written to highlight children’s interests, discoveries and progress. Their knowledge is linked strongly to new understandings and opportunities are identified to extend learning further. Teachers should now focus on ensuring that their planning consistently makes use of this information to tailor practices and inform next steps.</p><p>Teachers support children’s sense of belonging by greeting them in their own language, and through the design of photographic and artwork displays. Plans are in place to further enhance the reflection of children’s cultures, languages and identities in the learning spaces, to align with the vision of the kindergarten. ERO's evaluation confirms this direction.</p><p>The regularly reviewed philosophy is aligned with the kindergarten’s valued learning outcomes. These have been have further defined to describe enactment by tamariki, teachers and whānau and how used to inform planning, assessment and internal evaluation. Plans are in place for the newly appointed head teacher to lead a philosophy review involving the children, whānau and teachers. This should include revisiting priority learning outcomes and recapturing the unique aspects and context of the kindergarten.</p><p>Aspects of te ao Māori experiences are evident in the curriculum. Teachers seek to improve their te reo Māori as well as their knowledge of local stories, history and practices. The association’s current strategic focus on bicultural practices should support this improvement. In addition, building teachers’ understanding of specific strategies, in partnership with whānau, that promote the educational success of Māori children should also be a focus for association leaders.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well supported. External agencies are accessed, as appropriate, in consultation with parents.</p><p>Teachers are reflective, collaborative and improvement-focused. They are being supported to grow their evaluation practice through well-developed association systems and tools. Senior teachers should continue to work with teachers to build their capacity to measure the impact of their practice on children’s learning.</p><p>A very effective distributed leadership model is in place. Teachers are engaged and enthusiastic practitioners, confident to take on additional responsibilities, according to their strengths and interests. They effectively promote a sense of community and acknowledge parents’ expertise. ERO's evaluation affirms the key next steps self-identified by the team and senior leadership.</p><p>A comprehensive, well-considered appraisal process is in place. Teachers challenge themselves to continually improve their practice through strategic goal-setting and professional learning. Plans are in place to further strengthen teacher development by implementing an inquiry-based approach to appraisal. This should support teachers to better measure the success of improved practices in promoting outcomes for specific children and priority groups.</p><p>The association's senior teaching team are reflective and highly improvement focused. Robust, linked systems and processes have been skilfully developed to guide and grow teacher capability and positively impact on children’s learning. Leaders successfully foster a collective sense of responsibility for the vision, values and mission of the association.</p><p>The governance board includes community representatives with a wide range of useful skills. The board and senior leadership team work together well, with a shared commitment to meeting strategic goals and objectives for the benefit of children, whānau and community. Resource allocation clearly aligns with this focus. Equitable and inclusive ways to eliminate barriers to children’s learning and wellbeing are actively sought.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten teachers agree that their next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>review the philosophy</li>
<li>continue to build culturally responsive practices</li>
<li>consistently align planning with children's identified next steps.</li>
</ul><p>ERO, the governance board and senior leaders agree that they should continue to build their effectiveness by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>measuring the extent to which children's and their families’ outcomes are improved though association initiatives and systems. This should include analysing their impact on specific priority groups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing opportunities for whānau to actively contribute to the association’s operation and strategic direction.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waiwhetu Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waiwhetu Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>14 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
