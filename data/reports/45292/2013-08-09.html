</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Scenicland Limited administers four early childhood centres on the West Coast. Three centres are in Greymouth and the fourth centre is in Hokitika. Scenicland Preschool is located in Greymouth.</p><p>This is the centre’s first ERO review. The centre caters for children between two years old and school age. The centre is well resourced and has a very large outdoor area. The centre employs qualified early childhood teachers or teachers in training.</p><p>The manager is highly committed to employing qualified early childhood teachers and supporting staff members to gain an early childhood teacher qualification. A major contributing factor in attracting and keeping qualified staff is the centre’s location on the West Coast.</p><p>A high level of health and safety is maintained for children, staff and families.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy, confident and involved in their learning. They play well together across the age groups. Teachers have warm and caring relationships with the children. They have high expectations for learning and the development of positive social skills. They make good use of a wide range of teaching practices to help children develop their thinking and to be proud of their achievements.</p><p>Children with special needs are well integrated into the programme. Teachers ensure that children with special needs are included in all aspects of the programme and well supported in their learning and social skill development. They maintain close and positive relationships with the families and outside agencies. Individual education plan goals are carefully integrated into the planned programme for each child. Progress is well documented in ways that are meaningful for the child and those who know the child well.</p><p>Teachers are taking a range of positive steps to increase the inclusion of te reo and tikanga in the programme. They are beginning to make good use of self review, professional development and their support for each other to increase their confidence in and use of te reo Māori. Te reo Māori phrases are sometimes included in meaningful ways in children’s learning stories.</p><p>Children benefit from a large well-kept outdoor environment which is able to be used all year round. This provides opportunities for children to extend their physical skills and cooperative play through team games.</p><p>Teachers warmly welcome parents. They use a range of successful approaches to encourage parents to stay and play with their children. They make good use of the time parents are at the centre to share information about the child’s day. Some child assessments are beginning to make useful links between the home and centre learning experiences.</p><p>Teachers are highly motivated and involved in children’s learning. Teachers work well together to meet the needs of the children and to support each other in the programme. They also provide considerable support to each other to develop new skills to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Self review is becoming established and useful as a result of external professional development. Teachers are beginning to understand and follow a self-review process.</p><p>The manager and head teachers from the four centres, with support of advisors, have put together a strategic plan that provides direction for the future development of the centre and improving teaching and learning. The plan has clear objectives that cover learning and teaching and building capability and capacity within the organisation and with staff. The plan makes particular reference to increasing the focus on New Zealand’s bicultural heritage so that all children gain appropriate knowledge and experience success in this area.</p><p>The manager is committed to growing the leadership capabilities of her head teachers and staff. She is investing significantly in their ongoing professional development and involving them in major decisions for the organisation. The head teachers from the four centres told ERO that they value the opportunity to share experiences and expertise with each other and the manager on a regular basis.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers and ERO agree that the next steps to improve learning outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>extending self review to evaluate how well the goals of the long-term plans for the organisation and individual centres are being met</li>
<li>continuing to establish and improve self-review practices within the centre</li>
<li>strengthening child assessment and programme planning practices to improve their consistency and usefulness for learning and teaching</li>
<li>building closer partnerships with families of Māori children and the wider Maori community to promote Māori children’s success as Māori</li>
<li>continuing to build and strengthen educational partnerships with all families</li>
<li>continuing to use and review the effectiveness of the newly developed appraisal system.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Scenicland Pre School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Scenicland Pre School will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>9 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
