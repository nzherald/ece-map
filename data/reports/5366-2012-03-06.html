<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Ngahina Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support, advice and guidance to this teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>Children play and learn in a programme that offers them choices, promotes their independence and is inclusive in nature. They are frequently absorbed in sustained cooperative play. There is an overarching focus on early literacy, sustainable living and transition to school. The atmosphere is supportive and settled.</p><p>The high quality environment is carefully planned to stimulate children&rsquo;s interest, curiosity and engagement. They move freely between activities with easy access to the wide range of resources and equipment. The diverse cultural community is well reflected in displays and other play materials. Gardens are an attractive feature and provide additional real-life experiences.</p><p>Children are confident and independent learners who set their own challenges. They demonstrate good social skills and collaborative behaviours of working together, negotiation and cooperation. There are many examples of children supporting each other.</p><p>The kindergarten has built strong community relationships. Regular reciprocal visits occur with the adjacent primary school. Teachers work closely with other professionals and specialists to support children and families, further develop the environment and advance sustainability practices.</p><p>Teachers are sensitive, affirming and respectful of children and their families. They notice and respond to children&rsquo;s interests and strengths through conversation and the provision of additional resources. The teaching team has a shared vision and beliefs which are evident in practice.</p><p>The teaching team agrees that areas for further development include aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation, extending children&rsquo;s thinking and embedding te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori into the programme.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Ngahina Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Ngahina Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the learning environment;</li>
<li>programme provided for children; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4><em>Background</em></h4><p>The 2008 ERO review noted that the environment-based programme provided children with a variety of interesting learning opportunities. Interactions between teachers and children were caring and responsive. Areas identified as requiring improvement were te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori, aspects of assessment, programme planning and evaluation. The understanding and implementation of self review also required development. Teachers have undertaken professional development in these areas in the last three years.</p><p>Since 2008 the kindergarten has diversified its operations twice and now operates on a full licence for hours closely aligned to the school day. Older children attend three days a week and the younger ones the other two days. The number of teachers has increased, resulting in improved teacher/child ratios.</p><p>There has been continual upgrading of the environment and resources to support children&rsquo;s learning. This has resulted in spacious work and play spaces and a focus on conservation and sustainable practices. Plans are in place for the continued development of the environment.</p><h4><em>Areas of strength</em></h4><p>Environment</p><p>The high quality learning environment is carefully planned to stimulate children&rsquo;s interest, curiosity and engagement. They move freely between activities with easy access to the wide range of resources and equipment. The diverse cultural community is well reflected in displays and other materials. An expansive outdoor area provides ample opportunities for physical challenge and many inviting places for quiet reflection, construction and social play. The gardens are an attractive feature. These present daily authentic learning experiences as children involve themselves in all aspects of preparation, planting and harvesting.</p><p>Programme</p><p>Children benefit from a flexible and child-oriented programme that enables them to choose and develop activities to support their interests. They are frequently absorbed in sustained cooperative play. Transitions to routine times are well managed and unobtrusive. Teachers make a deliberate effort to include M&#257;ori contexts for learning. Children are experimenting with different technologies to explore and record their interests. There are many opportunities for them to revisit and reflect on previous experiences.</p><p>The teaching team is well established with a shared vision and beliefs. These are clearly reflected in the kindergarten philosophy and evident in practice. They appreciate each other&rsquo;s strengths and interests and are open to change. These aspects contribute to the consistent and settled atmosphere and programme.</p><p>There is a well established relationship with the adjacent primary school. Regular reciprocal visits help children and their family to become familiar with the different expectations and new environment. These practices assist a smooth transition to school.</p><p>Assessment</p><p>Teachers understanding of assessment and their practices have been strengthened through the use of Te Manawa, the association&rsquo;s criteria for curriculum implementation. There is now a stronger focus on learning dispositions and inclusion of the different perspectives of teachers, parents and children in the process. Individual portfolios capture each child&rsquo;s unique learning, characteristics and celebrate their cultural and family background. These aspects better reflect the principles of assessment for learning.</p><p>Interactions</p><p>Children are confident and independent learners who set their own challenges. They demonstrate good social skills and collaborative behaviours of working together, negotiation and cooperation. There are many examples of tuakana/teina as children support each other in their play and learning.</p><p>Teachers are sensitive, affirming and respectful of children and their families. They work quietly alongside children promoting problem solving, independence and creativity. Teachers notice and respond to children&rsquo;s interests and strengths through conversation and the provision of additional resources.</p><p>Self review</p><p>Spontaneous review covers a range of topics, is improvement focused and successful in improving outcomes for children. Teachers regularly reflect on their practice and set goals to continue to develop their professional practice and knowledge.</p><h4><em>Areas for development and review</em></h4><p>More consistent and purposeful teacher reflections are needed to better support the identification of strategies for programme direction and effectiveness of their practice.</p><p>The thread of children&rsquo;s continuous learning requires strengthening. The implementation of the identified next steps and the linking of observations to show connections and development over time would support this. At times, teachers miss opportunities for the deeper exploration of children&rsquo;s ideas and engagement in learning conversations.</p><p>Teachers need to continue to build their confidence and capability to further embed te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori in the programme.</p><p>The teaching team has identified that robust, planned self review is not yet well understood and requires further development.</p><h3>Association Support</h3><h4><em>Background</em></h4><p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4><em>Areas of strength</em></h4><p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a wide range of professional development opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4><em>Areas for development and review</em></h4><p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice as a result of feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</p>

<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><h4><em>Background</em></h4><p>The association&rsquo;s mission is to provide quality, inclusive and accessible early childhood education. Being inclusive and partnership with parents, wh&#257;nau and community are stated as core values and principles.</p><h4><em>Areas of strength</em></h4><p>The kindergarten environment is positive, welcoming and inclusive. Carefully considered transition processes are in place that are flexible to accommodate differing family needs. Teachers know children and their families well and use this knowledge effectively to support both adults and children.</p><p>All teachers attend children&rsquo;s individual planning meetings. They work together with families, agencies and specialists and take shared responsibility to implement the agreed strategies to support the child&rsquo;s learning and development. The progress with these goals and other successes are celebrated in the child&rsquo;s portfolio.</p><p>Children demonstrate inclusive behaviours in their play and interactions. They are tolerant, patient and accepting of each other.</p><h4><em>Areas for development and review</em></h4><p>There is no formal process in place to gather the aspirations wh&#257;nau have for their child while at the kindergarten. Developing this practice should further enhance partnership with parents.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Ngahina Kindergarten completed an ERO <span>Centre Management Assurance Statement</span> and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Recommendations</h2><p>ERO and the kindergarten leaders agreed that the priorities for development and review are those outlined in the report.</p><a id="6-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>Kathleen Atkins</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

</table><p>6 March 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-ngahina-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Ngahina Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Ngahina Kindergarten.</p><p>Ngahina Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support, advice and guidance to this teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>Children play and learn in a programme that offers them choices, promotes their independence and is inclusive in nature. They are frequently absorbed in sustained cooperative play. There is an overarching focus on early literacy, sustainable living and transition to school. The atmosphere is supportive and settled.</p><p>The high quality environment is carefully planned to stimulate children&rsquo;s interest, curiosity and engagement. They move freely between activities with easy access to the wide range of resources and equipment. The diverse cultural community is well reflected in displays and other play materials. Gardens are an attractive feature and provide additional real-life experiences.</p><p>Children are confident and independent learners who set their own challenges. They demonstrate good social skills and collaborative behaviours of working together, negotiation and cooperation. There are many examples of children supporting each other.</p><p>The kindergarten has built strong community relationships. Regular reciprocal visits occur with the adjacent primary school. Teachers work closely with other professionals and specialists to support children and families, further develop the environment and advance sustainability practices.</p><p>Teachers are sensitive, affirming and respectful of children and their families. They notice and respond to children&rsquo;s interests and strengths through conversation and the provision of additional resources. The teaching team has a shared vision and beliefs which are evident in practice.</p><p>The teaching team agrees that areas for further development include aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation, extending children&rsquo;s thinking and embedding te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori into the programme.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Kathleen Atkins</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
