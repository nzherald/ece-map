</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Akoteu Kato Kakala is a community based immersion Tongan early childhood centre. The centre is located in Otara, South Auckland and caters for children up to 5 years of age. The curriculum is underpinned by Tongan language and culture. All of the children have Tongan heritage.</p><p>The centre is governed by the Kakala Malie Trust through a management committee. Managers are responsible for the financial management of the centre and strategic decision making, including policy development. A head teacher leads the teaching team who are mainly registered teachers.</p><p>ERO&rsquo;s 2012 report acknowledged the centre&rsquo;s effective practices in supporting children&rsquo;s language and cultural identity. ERO recommended that managers and teachers should increase children&rsquo;s engagement in learning and enhance self review to promote centre improvement.</p><p>Teachers and managers have addressed these recommendations well to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Akoteu Kato Kakala philosophy is enacted well. The programme for children maintains a strong focus on Tongan language and culture. Teachers and children converse confidently in Tongan at group times and during play. Traditional Tongan songs are well integrated in spontaneous play and daily routines. Children are developing a strong sense of their cultural identity and a sense of belonging at the centre. Teachers also effectively integrate te reo and waiata M&#257;ori within the programme.</p><p>Children are curious and keen to learn. The programme is responsive in promoting values of ako, ilo and poto. Children are confident and make choices about their play. They interact positively with their peers and with adults. Teachers&rsquo; relationships with children and their families are warm and caring. Infants and toddlers mix well with older children and are encouraged to develop independence.</p><p>Teachers know children&rsquo;s strengths and support and play alongside them, promoting conversation and exploration. Teachers ask open questions to encourage children to share their ideas and opinions. Children participate in a variety of meaningful activities that are linked to their interests. Literacy and numeracy opportunities are included in children&rsquo;s play. Teachers provide a sound foundation for children&rsquo;s transition into school.</p><p>The well resourced indoor and outdoor environments reflect teachers&rsquo; commitment to improving children&rsquo;s learning and celebrating Tongan culture. The indoor area is attractively and thoughtfully presented with clearly defined areas and accessible resources. Wall displays and photographs allow children and parents to revisit learning experiences at the centre. The outdoor environment provides opportunities for children to engage in physical and exploratory play.</p><p>The learning programme is responsive to children&rsquo;s interests. Teachers plan for, assess and evaluate children&rsquo;s learning well. Attractive individual learning records show that children have opportunities to investigate, ask questions and play co-operatively with others. Teachers celebrate children&rsquo;s learning and acknowledge children&rsquo;s progress over time.</p><p>Teachers have established useful self-review systems that include indicators of effective practice. The teacher appraisal system promotes reflection and improvement. Teachers are committed to professional learning and further study. They are well supported to complete and improve their qualifications and develop skills for leadership.</p><p>A clear policy framework guides centre operations. Teachers and managers have developed comprehensive strategic and annual planning to promote progress. They monitor progress against strategic goals to ensure ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers recognise that they could continue:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening their shared understandings about effective teaching strategies to extend and challenge children&rsquo;s learning and expression</li>
<li>promoting children&rsquo;s fluency in the Tongan language.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Akoteu Kato Kakala completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Akoteu Kato Kakala will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>19 June 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
