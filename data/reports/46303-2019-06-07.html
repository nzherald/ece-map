</table><p>Farmhouse Preschool Karaka is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Farmhouse Preschool Karaka is a privately owned and operated all-day education and care centre. It is one of two small preschools under the same leadership situated in rural south Auckland and is licensed for 30 children from two years to school age. Currently there are 46 children on the roll, none of whom identify as Māori. The centre employs four qualified and registered teachers.</p><p>Farmhouse Preschool's philosophy aims to promote respectful practice, through the values of trust, fairness, patience, calmness, empathy, aroha, and respect. They also aim to promote a rural environment that follows children’s individual and collective interests. The centre vision and values intend to promote inclusive and authentic partnerships between whānau and community.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2016, the centre has employed four new teachers including a recently appointed head teacher. The philosophy has been reviewed, and centre-wide professional development has supported internal evaluation practices, leadership and the curriculum.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s learning is strongly supported by effective relationships between parents and teachers. Parents are included and valued as partners in their child’s learning through formal and informal communication. All children lead their own learning. They are supported and encouraged to follow their interests and strengths in an inclusive mixed-age programme that supports all children to achieve success. Experiences and activities provided for children are authentic and reflect and meet the aspirations of parents and families.</p><p>The large spacious rural environment effectively supports children’s opportunities to experience a wide range of learning contexts. The programme is calm and relaxed and encourages children to be considerate towards others. Sharing and turn-taking are well-promoted. Assessment and planning strongly identifies teacher's knowledge of learning through noticing, recognising and responding to children's interests and dispositions. Children's progress and continuity of learning is highly visible in learning stories and displays around the room. Children experience a rich curriculum where they are listened to and encouraged to become confident and successful learners and explorers.</p><p>Teachers are respectful and knowledgeable and know the strengths and interests of children well. Intentional and deliberate acts of teaching are evident throughout the programme. Literacy, mathematics and oral language are strongly fostered throughout the environment. There are many opportunities for children to learn, extend and grow their knowledge and skills. Risk taking, challenge and problem solving are promoted by teachers through authentic learning contexts. Children’s learning outcomes are effectively supported by engaged and highly responsive teachers.</p><p>Aspects of a bicultural curriculum that foster children’s knowledge of the dual heritage of Aotearoa, New Zealand are evident. Some te reo Māori is spoken by teachers and waiata is sung to support children’s knowledge and sense of Māori culture. Children experience an environment that reflects the natural and bicultural approach to play and learning. Strengthening teachers' implementation of the centre's bicultural plan is a natural next step.</p><p>Leaders strongly promote clear expectations for teaching and learning. A structured and measured plan guides teachers to effectively assess and plan for children’s learning. Professional learning and development is supporting teacher knowledge about self-review practices and procedures. This has led to a greater awareness of evaluation purpose, change and improvement. Leaders have developed an effective and comprehensive teacher appraisal system. They guide teachers' practice, and include targeted and purposeful professional learning and development aimed to grow teachers’ knowledge and skills. Collaborative ways of working between leaders and teachers promotes an environment where children are valued and affirmed as competent learners.</p><p>Effective governance guides daily operations of the centre. There is a clear and explicit strategic direction and vision in place. Policies and procedures meet legislative and regulatory requirements. The centre philosophy has been developed and enacted, it is now time to review the philosophy due to new teacher appointments. Thoughtfully defined governance roles and responsibilities contribute to quality and responsive teacher practice. A strong organisational culture is leading to ongoing improvement in outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers should now consider a strategic review of:</p><ul>
<li>the centre philosophy, this should include professional learning and development to promote sound knowledge of the newly revised early childhood curriculum <em>Te Whāriki</em></li>
<li>
<p>the centres bicultural curriculum to allow for teachers to actively engage and implement te reo and tikanga Māori.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Farmhouse Preschool Karaka completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>7 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
