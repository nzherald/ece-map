</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Amber Learning Centre (previously known as Daybreak Preschool) is a privately owned education and care service. The centre was purchased by new owners in July 2016 and there are many new staff members, including the team leader. The new owners have undertaken significant environmental and programme development, including reorganisation and replacement of equipment and resources to reflect the reviewed centre mission, vision and philosophy. Through this new philosophy the centre aspires to promote:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>children's unique and individual personalities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>home languages and cultural values</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>holistic learning through a play-based programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the natural environment to teach, inspire and foster imagination, curiosity and inquiry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a peaceful, inclusive and secure environment for all children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The new owners have also extended the licence to include up to 11 children under two years of age. At the time of this review 29 children were enrolled. The majority are Pākehā, two identify as Māori and there a number of children from Korean and other cultures.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's mission, vision and philosophy strongly promote positive learning outcomes for all children. These key elements have been developed in collaboration with staff and the parent community. The priority placed on inclusion and celebrating diversity is highly evident in centre operations, relationships and teachers' practice. Children and families feel valued, secure, and demonstrate a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>The centre owners have implemented a well-considered approach to strategic planning, which is providing a strong sense of purpose and direction for the centre. Planned strategies and actions prompt self review that is focused on what is important in providing the best possible outcomes for all children. The owners are highly reflective and are guiding teachers to use self review to evaluate the effectiveness of environments, the curriculum and their practice. This approach is contributing to continually improving the quality of education and care for children.</p><p>The centre manager is developing deliberate and effective strategies for building leadership, teachers' practice and capability. She has high expectations for herself and teachers in a culture where children are first and foremost. Together with teachers, leaders encourage and invite parents and whānau to take an active part in centre events and activities. Teachers value the guidance and coaching they receive from the manager and team leader, and use this to reflect on their practice to improve learning opportunities for children.</p><p>Recent self review of the environment, curriculum and philosophy is resulting in programmes and practices that more effectively respond to individual children's interests, ideas and preferences. Significant features of the curriculum and teachers' practice include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>child-initiated and play-based learning, where children have a voice in decisions about their learning, programmes and routines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>many effective strategies that foster children's problem solving, self management, social skills and confidence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>natural environments that support integration of literacy, mathematics, science and creativity through authentic and meaningful exploration and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>culturally responsive practices that affirm each child's language, culture and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>inclusive practices that value all children's abilities and promote equitable outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opportunities for children to hear te reo Māori and be introduced to cultural practices valued by Māori.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children's enjoyment of learning is evident through high levels of interests and engagement in the programme, and their interactions with peers and teachers.</p><p>Teachers have established a warm friendly atmosphere that is underpinned by trusting and respectful relationships. Sensitive, nurturing and responsive settling strategies enable children and parents to feel heard, safe and confident. Children benefit from the calm and peaceful setting that supports their wellbeing and sense of belonging.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to continue recent positive developments, leaders and teachers need to strengthen aspects of assessment and planning procedures, alongside shared understandings and expectations about agreed 'best practice' aligned to the Amber Learning Centre philosophy.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Amber Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a</p><p>potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Amber Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>21 October 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
