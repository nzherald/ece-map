</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bear Park is a privately-owned centre licensed for 60 children. The centre provides education and care across four rooms including two rooms for infants and toddlers with access to their own outdoor area. The leaders have made the deliberate decision to have small group sizes, each with a team of teachers. The centre owner and centre supervisor are supported by the Bear Park franchisor and a pedagogical team located in Auckland. The service is located in the suburb of St Clair and operates from a large home developed for the purpose. It has been open for four years. The centre has made some good progress addressing the recommendations from its first ERO review in 2013.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Parents and children are warmly welcomed and feel comfortable at the centre. A strong sense of whanaungatanga and manaakitanga is evident. Children have positive, trusting relationships with their teachers. They are familiar with the centre routines, settle quickly on arrival and engage confidently with one another in play.</p><p>The teachers know the children well and take time to understand their individual needs and preferences. They have effective systems for regularly collaborating with parents and gathering their wishes for their children. Teachers encourage children to be curious through a range of opportunities to investigate and explore. Learning records show that the teachers want children to learn across all aspects of their being. They plan programmes to support learning in an holistic way, aiming for a good balance. Leaders and teachers model and encourage a love of learning and a passion for life. They support children to be independent and take responsibility for themselves and others. Teachers use a range of ways to deliberately stimulate and challenge children's thinking and extend their learning. </p><p>Infants and toddlers are well cared for in a calm, unhurried environment. Teachers interpret and respond to children's subtle cues promptly and with respect. The small groupings provide children with the space they need to play and learn independently. Teachers focus on supporting children with language development. This is done particularly well through the meaningful learning-focused interactions and conversations they have with the children.</p><p>Teachers are committed to furthering their knowledge and confidence with things Māori. Aspects of Māori culture and language are evident in the daily programme. Teachers and children use waiata, karakia and some te reo in the course of the day. Leaders have identified the need to plan for ongoing learning and understanding of Māori perspectives and bicultural practices. This should ensure continual progress. Linked to this is the development of the centre philosophy which could better reflect the centre's beliefs and priorities for learning and biculturalism.</p><p>Other positive features supporting children to learn include:</p><ul>
<li>the focus on healthy living through carefully planned meals and a wide range of opportunities for physical exploration and development</li>
<li>sensitively and carefully considered transition processes to help children to be confident and successful in new situations.</li>
</ul><p>Children, parents and teachers receive valued support from the centre owners and leaders. Relationships are based on respect and trust. Leaders favour a collaborative approach to growing the service and improving the quality of teaching and learning. The service is well managed and there are robust systems to guide and monitor progress with centre developments. Leaders and teachers use the many opportunities for professional development to build on their knowledge, share new learning with colleagues and put into practice new ideas. Teachers are given time to work together to plan for learning and to critically reflect on practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leaders have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps for the centre are to continue to develop and refine:</p><ul>
<li>processes to ensure bicultural practices are always growing and progress is sustained</li>
<li>programme planning, assessment and evaluation toward achieving consistent quality</li>
<li>the centre's internal evaluation systems and the use of indicators of best practice</li>
<li>a formal schedule for internal evaluation to better show that the key aspects of the service are being regularly evaluated. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bear Park - St Clair completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h4>Next ERO Review</h4><p><b>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</b></p><p>The next ERO review of Bear Park - St Clair will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>1 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><div>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
