</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The philosophy of the Bluff Kindergarten states that &ldquo;tamariki (children) and wh&#257;nau are the manawa (heart) of our kindergarten.&rdquo; This is very evident in the programme and practices in this kindergarten.</p><p>Bluff Kindergarten is located in the coastal fishing community of Bluff near Invercargill. It provides extended morning sessions for up to 30 tamariki. The kindergarten has two playgroups for younger tamariki, one in the afternoon and one in the morning. Most of the tamariki who attend are M&#257;ori.</p><p>The head teacher and teacher have worked together for some time and have made some good progress in implementing the recommendations of the August 2010 ERO report. The next step for teachers is to continue their mahi (work) in self review, and planning and assessment processes.</p><p>Kindergartens South have extensively upgraded the outdoor area to create a natural environment that incorporates key elements of the Bluff community such as links to the marae and fishing.</p><p>The teachers have thoughtfully created an indoor area that is welcoming, inviting and well resourced.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 23 reviews in the Southland kindergarten association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Bluff Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children. Both the philosophy and vision seek to realise the potential of M&#257;ori tamariki and their wh&#257;nau. The bicultural nature of Aotearoa is evident in both these documents, and within the everyday routines, practices and interactions in the kindergarten. Teachers and children confidently use te reo M&#257;ori in the sessions.</p><p>Tamariki know they belong to the Bluff community. Their teachers have built effective relationships with their wh&#257;nau and within the community.</p><p>This has been the result of planned actions, such as:</p><ul>
<li>regular wh&#257;nau hui</li>
<li>providing mathematics games for children to play at home</li>
<li>home-centre mahi books</li>
<li>frequent contact with the schools</li>
<li>well planned transitions for children when moving from kindergarten to school.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are determined to achieve the community&rsquo;s vision for the kindergarten. Teachers ardently believe in the worth of their kindergarten.</p><p>There is a sense of whanaungatanga in the kindergarten. Teachers are careful to nurture the mana (worth) and wairua (essence) of each child and their wh&#257;nau and appropriately respond to, and advocate for them. The tamariki know each other well. The teachers foster their tuakana-teina relationships. Tamariki play in small groups in sustained play and make choices about what they want to do in the programme. They benefit from routines and rituals that offer predictability and are used as learning experiences in the kindergarten. Some of the rituals, such as, the preparation for and saying of the karakia are child initiated and enhance their sense of ownership, confidence and, belonging.</p><p>The teachers use Bluff and their knowledge of the tamariki as contexts for learning. They recognise that what the tamariki are interested in and what knowledge they bring with them is what makes learning relevant and meaningful. For example, mutton birding, fishing, helping agencies like the police, and M&#257;ori myths and legends.</p><p>Other aspects of the programme that benefit the learning of tamariki are:</p><ul>
<li>the good questions teachers ask to extend their learning and promote skill development</li>
<li>the rich art programme where tamariki can express ideas in many creative ways and also learn strategies and techniques for expressing their ideas</li>
<li>the range of resources to support learning in the environment</li>
<li>many excursions in and around the community and further afield</li>
<li>visitors to the kindergarten</li>
<li>a strong focus on numeracy and literacy.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers work together collaboratively. They know each other well and use each other&rsquo;s strengths.The head teacher provides good leadership. She is responsive and respectful and, in partnership with her teacher, has created a sense of genuine enjoyment in the kindergarten.</p><p>The Kindergarten South governors consulted widely when developing the vision and goals that guide the long term direction of the association. They have high expectations that the association and each kindergarten will:</p><ul>
<li>involve the community</li>
<li>provide natural learning environments</li>
<li>do what is best for children</li>
<li>be a good employer.</li>
</ul><p>The association is committed to transforming each kindergarten&rsquo;s outdoor play area. Children now play and learn in beautiful and natural environments.</p><p>Governors and staff have a clear understanding of the roles of governance and management in the association. They have developed a useful policy framework and guidelines that support the day-to-day and long-term operation of the kindergartens.</p><p>The advisory-support teachers provide useful feedback and guidance to staff and endorse the high expectations set by the board of governors. Bluff Kindergarten benefits from strong ongoing support from the general manager and other association staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The head teacher and teacher have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>find ways to plan for groups and individuals that are useful and used and inform decision making about children&rsquo;s next learning</li>
<li>make clear links between the kindergarten vision, philosophy and planning and assessment</li>
<li>further develop self-review practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bluff Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bluff Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>6 November 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou &#256;rahi</em> &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>M&#257;tauranga</em> &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
