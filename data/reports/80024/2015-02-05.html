</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>This centre is a community-based kindergarten in rural Southland. It is governed by a parent committee. The parent group has long-serving members who are very supportive of the teachers and motivated to continue to build the quality of the service and ensure its viability. The kindergarten has extended its hours and is now open from 8:30am to 1:30pm four days a week. Children over the age of two are able to attend.</p><p>There have been a number of changes at the kindergarten since the previous ERO visit in 2010. The committee has purchased the building it had previously leased and has begun to develop the property to better suit its purpose. A second teacher was appointed and has been part of the team for nearly four years. An administrative manager has been employed to reduce the workload on parent volunteers and the head teacher. The manager is also the licensee and is a relief teacher when needed. The kindergarten has been relicensed by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and as a consequence, received support to further develop aspects of the service that needed improvement.</p><p>Children continue to benefit from good quality teaching and the teachers’ ability to reflect and improve on their practice.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children work and play well together in a welcoming, calm and settled environment. They and their parents have a strong sense of belonging to the kindergarten. Children benefit from the positive, supportive relationships they have with each other and the teachers. Strong friendships are evident between children and between adults. Parents spoken to say they see the kindergarten as a place to touch base and feel connected to other families in the widespread rural community. </p><p>The teachers work well as a team. They know the children and their families well.</p><p>They have developed a system to document learning goals for children that include parents’ aspirations for their children. Teachers use some effective teaching strategies in their daily practice to build on their knowledge of the children’s interests, strengths and abilities. Teachers frequently engage in a range of interesting conversations with children. They listen carefully to children and value their comments and ideas. Children are encouraged to explore, discover and wonder. Children benefit from a consistent approach from teachers around respectful behaviours.</p><p>The programme and environment provide good opportunities for children to explore, test, investigate, discover and create. Teachers build the children’s knowledge about the world around them through various topics of interest. Teachers effectively use incidental teaching moments to promote children’s learning in early literacy and mathematics and to promote their physical and social development. Children are encouraged to make good choices, to be independent and to take responsibility for themselves. Teachers have begun to integrate te reo and waiata Māori especially at group time. Key next steps:</p><p>ERO agrees with the areas for development the teachers have identified. These include:</p><ul>
<li>developing the assessment and programme planning systems so that specific intentional acts of teaching are evident, and includes regular review of individual children’s learning goals</li>
<li>evaluating the impact of the planned programme and the teaching strategies on children’s individual and group learning</li>
<li>strengthening the use of te reo Māori and Māori perspectives into the day-to-day programme.</li>
</ul><p>It may also be useful for the teachers to review the kindergarten philosophy and unpack their understanding of how this should look in practice. The philosophy needs to align with the kindergarten’s short and long term strategic and annual goals and have links to self review.</p><h3>Governance and Leadership</h3><p>The kindergarten governing committee recently identified a group of parents who have agreed to participate in professional development to strengthen their understanding of governance. They are committed to ensuring a viable service, improving the kindergarten premises and supporting the teachers. The committee is aware that the first step in achieving this is to be clear about the various roles and responsibilities and to develop ways to be accountable and continually improve the service.</p><p>Recent developments that support the process towards effective governance and management of the kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>redefining roles and responsibilities</li>
<li>adapting existing strategic and annual plans to provide some direction and continuity for aspects of the service while professional development is underway</li>
<li>the appointment of an administration manager who has responsibility for improving administration systems and monitoring compliance with regulations</li>
<li>professional development opportunities for the teachers that build their knowledge and improve practice.</li>
</ul><p>The kindergarten has benefited from helpful feedback from the MOE relicensing process. The head teacher is a strong and capable leader. Through self review she has developed a good understanding of the steps they need to take to continually improve learning and teaching.</p><p>The key next steps toward meeting the goals identified to improve governance and management include:</p><ul>
<li>further development and alignment of the strategic and annual plans</li>
<li>ensuring the annual plans clearly identify who, what, when and how desired changes will be implemented and how the committee will know that these have been achieved</li>
<li>continuing the development of administration systems to monitor progress in meeting and maintaining compliance with requirements</li>
<li>developing and implementing an effective appraisal system for all employed staff.</li>
</ul><p>ERO believes the centre should investigate the usefulness of an external mentor to support the head teacher in her leadership role.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waianiwa Community Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Waianiwa Community Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>5 February 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
<li>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</li>
</ul><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
