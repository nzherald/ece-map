</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Village Preschool and Childcare Centre is a privately-owned centre located in Bethlehem, Tauranga. It is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 87 children, including 30 up to the age of two years. The roll of 104 children includes 16 children who identify as Māori.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor environments promote exploration and opportunities for collaborative play for infants, toddlers, and pre-schoolers. The indoor and outdoor areas support children to purposefully engage in an area of play depending on their current interests. These areas are well connected and foster positive interactions between younger and older children.</p><p>The centre is a member of the Otūmoetai Community of Learning|Kāhui Ako.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have responded well to the areas for development identified in the 2014 ERO report. They have focused on reviewing the philosophy, enhancing bicultural practice and developing assessment practices to better acknowledge and celebrate children's learning, progress and development overtime.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are supported well. Teachers are responsive to their strengths, interests and needs. Choices for learning, self-care and social competency are highly evident. The philosophy has been recently reviewed and is actively fostered throughout the centre. Nurturing relationships and empowerment for children's learning are highly evident in teachers' practice.</p><p>A family-orientated centre culture is in place. Meaningful and reciprocal relationships with children and their whānau are fostered. Parent aspirations are invited and are actively supporting direction for children’s learning. Curiousity is fostered and learners are encouraged to discover new experiences and challenges throughout their play.</p><p>Nurturing interactions foster the high-quality curriculum of care for children up to the age of two. Infants and toddlers are well supported and empowered to build their self-confidence and awareness. The physical environment supports exploration and fosters focussed learning experiences.</p><p>A highly responsive and collaborative approach to support and strategies that best meet the needs of diverse learners is evident. Children are encouraged to learn at their own pace. Strong relationships between parents, the centre, and external agencies promote well-considered learning experiences. Strengthening documentation to show the progress of the child’s learning overtime should better foster continuity for the learner.</p><p>Transition in and through the centre is highly responsive to children’s readiness and occurs at the child's pace. The process and practice is respectful and inclusive of the child’s needs and wants. Their feelings and emotions are considerately acknowledged. The centre is extending links with local schools to further support and develop the process for transition to school.</p><p>The centre has reviewed its bicultural practice to better support children’s understanding and knowledge of the dual heritage of Aotearoa, New Zealand. Children’s portfolios are beginning to show a deepening bicultural curriculum. Leaders and teachers have identified the need to weave te ao Māori deliberately and purposefully into learning experiences and the environment. This should better support an authentic approach to respond to Māori children's learning.</p><p>Learning stories reflect a rich and varied curriculum. Risk taking and opportunities for challenge are actively promoted and support extension of meaningful learning experiences. Frequent excursions, including to the centre's Discovery Garden, strengthen children's links with the community and environment. These experiences promote knowledge of the living world and further enhance their learning.</p><p>Opportunities for leadership among teachers is actively promoted and supported. A transparent and deliberate approach to growing teachers' knowledge is evident throughout the centre. Staff experience a wide range of professional learning and development opportunities that broaden and build their teaching capability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen the recording of progress over time for diverse learners to support continuity across the centre for individual children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>weave te ao Māori deliberately and purposefully into learning experiences and the environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build understanding of effective evaluation centre wide.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Village Preschool &amp; Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Village Preschool &amp; Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>14 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/#return times" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
