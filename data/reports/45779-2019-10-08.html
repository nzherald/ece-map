</table><p>Kindercare Learning Centres (Aotea) requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Aotea is one of eight learning services in the Wellington region owned and operated by Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd (the organisation). The centre is licensed for 110 children, including 30 up to two years of age. At the time of the review 132 children attended the centre. Families represent a range of cultures and ethnic groups.</p><p>The purpose built centre caters for children in age-specific rooms that access shared outdoor spaces. Meals are provided by a centre cook. The organisation provides policies, procedures and a framework to monitor health and safety. An area manager works in partnership with the centre director to support the operation of the centre.</p><p>The service philosophy is based on Kindercares' three key values: ‘Safe, Loved and Learning’.</p><p>Since the April 2016 ERO report there have been significant changes of staff, including three changes of centre manager. The current centre manager was appointed early 2018, with a new leadership team appointed since that time.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified areas requiring further development. These included the improvement of assessment, planning, evaluation and the bicultural curriculum, further engagement with Māori and Pacific families, strengthening of respectful and responsive caregiving, further enhancement of appraisal and self-review practices. Progress has been made in cultural responsiveness and planning, and reporting has been reviewed.</p><p>The review was one of five in Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd in Wellington.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre presents an attractive environment for learning. The carefully developed outdoor play space is well utilised for physical and social play. Children can freely access a range of resources to support their interests, both indoors and outside.</p><p>Interactions between teachers and children are positive and appropriately focused on active participation and children's wellbeing. Children are supported to become confident communicators and to participate in collaborative and independent learning opportunities. They respond well to teachers and their peers. Aspects of literacy and numeracy are evident in the learning environment and in the activities provided, especially for older children.</p><p>Good provision is made for children with additional learning needs. Teachers proactively collaborate with relevant external experts to support these learners.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well supported with relevant learning opportunities. Teachers are kind, caring and respectful in their interactions. Further consideration of meal and bedtime routines is necessary so that they are suitably responsive to children's needs.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate a knowledge of individual children and their learning. Aspects of group and individual planning are evident in portfolios. Teachers are beginning to explore the use of deliberate strategies to extend children's learning and develop their oral language. Examples of intentional teaching were observed. Teachers have begun to collect parent aspirations to inform children's individual programmes.</p><p>Assessment and planning for learning require further development. Teachers use a range of formats to plan for infants, toddlers and children. They currently use an electronic format to share assessments and report children's learning to parents. Leaders should purposefully build teachers' practice and understanding in this area, and support teachers to transfer current theory into their everyday practices.</p><p>Te ao Māori is promoted. There has been a deliberate focus on growing teachers' understanding of, and competence in, te reo me ngā tikanga Māori. A bicultural leader supports teachers to authentically integrate this into daily programmes, with emphasis on legends and places of importance to local iwi. As a consequence, teachers have increased their use of te reo Māori in classrooms, and aspects of te ao Māori are evident in the curriculum. Continuing development in this area is a next step. Centre leaders have identified that a next step is using the document, Tapasā, to increase teachers' cultural knowledge and better promote the success of children of Pacific heritage.</p><p>The service has not yet established localised priority learning outcomes, in liaison with whānau and community, and in response to the updated early learning curriculum, Te Whāriki. Undertaking professional learning in this area is a key next step. These priority outcomes can then be promoted and monitored through assessment, planning and evaluation practices.</p><p>Internal evaluation and teacher inquiry continue to require development. Leaders and teachers should focus evaluations and inquiries on outcomes for children. Focusing on outcomes will contribute to more effective evaluation of practices and improvements.</p><p>The organisation has established systems to support the professional learning and development of teachers. There is a clear focus on building leadership. To better promote positive outcomes for children, the implementation and consistency of appraisal and mentoring processes should be improved.</p><p>A next step for the organisation is to evaluate how consistently leaders, including managers and centre directors, build teachers’ capability and improve practice. To better promote timely improvements, feedback at all levels should be more strongly focused on constructive critique, meaningful challenge, and evidence of teaching and learning progress.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At service level, priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>establish the service’s priority learning outcomes, in collaboration with families and community</li>
<li>continue to develop assessment and planning processes, including ways to add depth and complexity to the learning of individual children</li>
<li>strengthen teaching through the use of intentional teaching strategies that add complexity to children’s learning</li>
<li>give further consideration to routines for babies and toddlers so that they are suitably responsive to individual needs</li>
<li>develop internal evaluation and teacher inquiry to focus on outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>The organisation should continue to strengthen and embed:</p><ul>
<li>the principles of The Treaty of Waitangi in guiding documents and teacher practices</li>
<li>evaluation of effectiveness at leadership, management and governance levels</li>
<li>alignment of strategic planning, internal evaluation and reporting.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, the organisation should evaluate and strengthen the effectiveness of leaders, including area managers, in building teachers’ capability and improving practice. Particular attention should be paid to ensuring the enactment of the key next steps identified in this service’s ERO report.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres (Aotea) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to health and safety. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure all teaching staff are aware of healthy food practices when serving food to children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a robust process for the identification of hazards including unsecured items that may fall and cause a serious injury</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS20, HS6</p><p>Since the review, leaders have taken steps to address some of non-compliances identified.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>8 October 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
