<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Montessori Horizons Preschool is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Montessori Horizons Preschool, located in Riwaka, between Motueka and Kaiteriteri, provides education and care for children in two rooms, each catering for children aged from two and a half to six years of age. The centre roll is stable at 72 children.</p><p>The two co-owners are also managers, team leaders and teachers.</p><p>Staff numbers have continued to increase since the 2010 ERO review. Of the seven staff, five are fully qualified and two are well supported in their training.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy acknowledges the learning needs and interests of each child in the Montessori environment and is evident in centre practices. Respect for self, others and the environment is evident in centre practice and underpins all aspects of operations. The philosophy is regularly reviewed with input from parents.</p><p>Teachers are currently implementing outcomes of a recent review of assessment, planning and evaluation. This is appropriately focused on aligning children's emerging interests to clearly reflect the Montessori approach to learning and teaching. Consistency of assessment, planning and evaluation is developing.</p><p>Well presented and organised classroom environments foster belonging and promote children's engagement in learning activities. Children can readily and independently access a good range of high quality resources that support their learning and the Montessori approach. Children care for living plants in the outdoor gardens, and animals. Fixed and moveable climbing equipment provide challenge and encourage physical activity and development.</p><p>A range of effective teaching strategies is evident in practice. Adults engage children in learning conversations, using open questioning and building on prior knowledge and interests. Well established centre routines support children&rsquo;s learning. They are happy and well engaged in the programme, working cooperatively in groups and individually. A calm settled environment is evident.</p><p>Staff are aware of the importance of developing partnerships with families and are currently working to further enhance these. Parents are regularly involved in wide ranging self review. Surveys are well used to gather parent views and to inform review. Parents&rsquo; aspirations for their children are sought and responded to.</p><p>Aspects of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori are integrated into the programme and evident in the environment. These actions raise the profile and mana of things M&#257;ori.</p><ul>
<li>Teachers should consider ways that success for M&#257;ori children can be defined, enhanced and integrated into centre practices and curriculum.</li>
</ul><p>Co-owners are reflective, have sound knowledge of the Montessori approach and other early childhood theories and practices. They are working towards strengthening their leadership roles.</p><ul>
<li>Professional development to define leadership roles is currently being investigated. ERO&rsquo;s findings support this direction.</li>
</ul><p>Self review is regular and well planned. The focus on continuing development and improvement is supported by a well documented process. Outcomes of wide-ranging self review contribute to ongoing development and improvement.</p><ul>
<li>Self review processes should be strengthened by developing evaluative questions and clearly defining specific outcome indicators to help identify achievement of goals.</li>
</ul><p>Strategic planning, identified as an area for improvement in the 2010 ERO report, has been reviewed with community input. This now underpins annual planning and provides clear strategic direction.</p><p>Review of the appraisal process led the team to identify that the system, as implemented in 2012, lacked rigour. A new process for all staff has been recently implemented for 2013 and will be evaluated as it proceeds. The documented process should contribute to a collaborative professional development programme linked to appraisal and centre wide goals.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Montessori Horizons Preschool completed an ERO Centre Management Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>Information about the Early Childhood Service</span></h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
