</table><p>Happy Days Childcare Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Happy Days Childcare Centre is a privately owned and operated early learning service situated in Upper Hutt. It provides all day education and care for up to 75 children from birth to school age, five days a week. At the time of this ERO review, 15 of the children enrolled identified as Māori and 6 as Pacific.</p><p>The service philosophy focuses on agreed core values of respect, empowerment, integrity, compassion, playfulness, resilience, gentleness, trust and love. These points have been unpacked to build shared understandings of these elements to guide practice.</p><p>A board governs the centre. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) manages day-to-day operation. A manager works in collaboration with the CEO to support the teaching team. There has been a number of changes in teaching staff.</p><p>The 2014 and 2016 ERO reviews identified significant concerns about the quality of practice and operation. Since that time, the service has received targeted support through the Ministry of Education (MoE) funded programme, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO). Leaders developed a plan to address the key areas requiring improvement, in consultation with the MoE. Good progress has been made and areas of non-compliance have been addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in purposeful learning through a mixture of child and teacher-led activities. They freely access resources to support their interests and achieve their learning goals. Excursions into the community support their growing knowledge of the world around them. Independent and group work are promoted. There is a strong focus on developing children's social competencies, so they can engage positively with their peers and teachers.</p><p>Teachers respond sensitively to each child’s changing needs and preferences. The calm slow pace of the programme enables them to have time and space to lead their learning. The importance of play is respected and valued.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported to participate fully in the programme. Teachers are proactive in identifying support needs and accessing these. They work alongside parents to determine learning goals. External agencies are accessed when required.</p><p>The centre philosophies are underpinned by shared values and beliefs. These were developed in collaboration with leaders, teachers, whānau and children and make clear the expected practice. Leaders should next consider how best they can engage with parents, whānau Māori and their Pacific community to determine what educational success looks like for them.</p><p>A sound planning framework is in place for individual and group learning. It focuses on teachers noticing children's emerging interests, recognising opportunities for learning and responding through planning appropriate learning experiences. Parents, whānau and teachers co-construct meaningful learning goals for children's learning. Teachers use <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the refreshed early childhood curriculum, to help them to design the programme. Assessment builds children’s identity as a successful learner. As this process continues to be embedded, leaders should consider how they can:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>build teachers' knowledge and understanding so a more consistent approach to assessment is implemented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make children’s cultures, languages and identities more visible in assessment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Kaupapa Māori concepts are becoming well-integrated in the curriculum. Examples include excursion to the local marae and planned annual events that enrich the programme. Teachers are beginning to gain a greater understanding of how they can celebrate te ao Māori in the curriculum. Greater use of te reo Māori in everyday practice should strengthen this process. In addition, leaders and teachers should continue to extend and celebrate places of significant value for Māori and celebrate these within the curriculum.</p><p>A well-considered internal evaluation framework has been implemented. Leaders and teachers are beginning to use this to help them make informed decisions for supporting their most recent ongoing improvements. Building teachers' capability to evaluate the effectiveness of their practice should strengthen this process.</p><p>The centre’s policies and procedures have been significantly redeveloped to ensure they are up-to-date and meet legislative requirements. Leaders and teachers show an increased understanding of operational requirements of the centre that supports ongoing sustainability and improvement.</p><p>There is a sound appraisal system in place to support and grow teacher capability. Leaders should continue to refine this process by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing more specific and measurable teacher goals that are aligned to outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>including goals to support leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving alignment with the Education Council quality practice framework.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The centre has developed annual and strategic plans that set the priorities and direction for the service. Further consideration should be given to making goals more specific and measurable. This should assist the centre to better measure the progress towards achieving its goals and objectives.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that their priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>engage with whānau Māori and the Pacific community to determine what educational success looks like for them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the use of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori in the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance assessment and planning for children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop the appraisal process and build teachers internal evaluation capability.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Happy Days Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Happy Days Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>5 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
