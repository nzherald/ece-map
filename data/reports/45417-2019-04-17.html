</table><p>Kid's Land Educare Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kid's Land Educare Centre in Blockhouse Bay, provides all-day education and care for up to 65 children, with a maximum of 18 children under two years of age. Most children attending are Chinese. A very small number of children have Māori or Pacific heritage.</p><p>The philosophy highlights Christian beliefs, respecting the individuality of children and valuing partnerships with parents as guiding principles. It promotes a safe and secure environment for all children and their families. The programme is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and aspects of Reggio Emilia and Montessori approaches.</p><p>The centre owner/manager and most staff are qualified teachers. The manager has oversight of the day-to-day running of the centre, and head teachers manage the under two and the over two areas. Since the 2015 ERO report there have been changes in staff, including a new head teacher.</p><p>The service operates in two adjacent houses with large outdoor areas, which have been adapted to provide learning programmes for young children. At specific times of the day, both groups of children meet together and have mixed-age play opportunities.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified some areas for improvement. The owner has responded positively to ERO's recommendation to increase children's access to play areas. Internal evaluation and teacher appraisal continue to be areas for improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed to the centre. Children are confident and interact well with their peers and teachers. Teachers' interactions with children and families are respectful. Families are valued members of the centre. Secure relationships between teachers, children and families promote the development of younger children's positive sense of self.</p><p>The learning environment is well organised and supports a semi-structured programme. Children explore the environment and make choices about their play. The outdoor learning environment supports children to take risks, be curious and creative problem solvers. Literacy, mathematics and physical activity are well promoted in the context of play. Teachers work alongside children and support them with their play choices.</p><p>Teachers have developed planning and documented processes that enable them to identify and respond to children's interests and group projects. Attractive online learning records provide ready access for families to information about their children’s participation in the programme. Teachers know children well. They work with parents to identify and respond to their aspirations for their children.</p><p>Parents feel comfortable to participate in and contribute to the curriculum. Social media provides a way of keeping parents regularly informed about the programme and wellbeing matters.</p><p>The manager needs to strengthen governance and management practices to prioritise improved outcomes for children. Leadership roles and responsibilities need to be clarified. It is timely to review policies and procedures, particularly those relating to provision for children's health and safety. While internal evaluation is beginning to guide improvements, a more rigorous process would help to ensure policies and procedures reflect current legal requirements and best practice in early childhood education.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for ongoing improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>making planning more visible for children and families, and documenting children's individual learning progress over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the service's long-term plans to identify specific goals and actions that will support ongoing improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the service's philosophy to better reflect the principles and practices promoted by <em>Te Whāriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing current teacher appraisal practices, and implementing robust systems that are improvement focused and align with Teaching Council requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the centre manager seek external professional support to improve governance and leadership practices.</p><p>The service will provide ERO with an action plan that shows how priorities for improvement will be addressed. ERO will evaluate the extent of this progress within six months.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kid's Land Educare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the service should:</p><ul>
<li>review policies and associated practices regularly against legal requirements such as the Vulnerable Children Act 2014 and Health and Safety at Work Act 2015</li>
<li>ensure that premises, facilities and other equipment are regularly maintained and kept free from hazards.</li>
</ul><p>Subsequent to ERO's on-site evaluation process, the owner provided a plan showing that the majority of health and safety matters identified during the review had been addressed.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>17 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
