<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Arohena Playcentre is run as a family cooperative, early childhood service where parents and children learn alongside one another. The playcentre is located in attractive rural surroundings next to Arohena School. It provides sessional education and care for children from birth to school age. It operates under the umbrella of the King Country Playcentre Association (KCPA) and is affiliated to the New Zealand Playcentre Federation.</p><p>Children experience a well-prepared, interesting learning environment that is designed to encourage them to actively explore and learn through their play. Good use is made of local community environments, including a native bush area in close proximity to the playcentre. Children engage in learning in a range of meaningful contexts and have opportunities to be involved in sustained play.</p><p>The wider world of family and community is valued and integral to children&rsquo;s learning. The playcentre maintains close links with its community and local primary school. Trusting and respectful social relationships are strongly evident among children and adults, which creates a warm caring and positive atmosphere that fosters children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>The association provides comprehensive guidelines and an experienced centre support person to assist playcentre families to run the service. The playcentre is well led and effectively managed by a group of dedicated parents/caregivers. This collaborative approach to leadership is assisting parents to increase their knowledge and understanding of good practice for the education and care of children. The recently developed 2012 strategic plan clearly identifies goals and objectives to further develop the quality of education and care. Parents and caregivers are currently developing the bicultural dimension within the programme and playcentre systems for implementing and monitoring long-term self-review goals.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Arohena Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atArohena Playcentre.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Arohena Playcentre operates as a parent cooperative, within the playcentre philosophy of child-centred learning and parent involvement. The centre&rsquo;s philosophy involves parents and caregivers learning alongside their children and extending learning through children&rsquo;s play. Parents have access to playcentre training courses, are encouraged to make decisions about their children&rsquo;s education and recognise the importance of parents as first teachers.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review, the roll and the number of playcentre trained parents have significantly increased. Sustained support from the association, including an experienced centre support person, has contributed to ongoing improvements and centre relicensing under the 2008 Early Childhood Regulations. In addition, parents and caregivers have participated in professional development about assessment practices.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Family and community: The wider world of family and community is valued and is integral to children&rsquo;s learning. The playcentre maintains close links with its community and local primary school. Community people generously offer their time, skills and contribute financially to the service. Community social events are inclusive of playcentre families, and new families to the area are warmly welcomed. Reciprocal visits and shared events with the school and playcentre enrich the learning programme and support children&rsquo;s transition to school.</p><p>Learning through play: Parents and caregivers are dedicated to the playcentre philosophy, where children learn through play. Children experience a well-prepared and interesting learning environment to actively explore. Playcentre families provide areas of play with high-quality resources and equipment that enable children to pursue areas of interest and initiate their own learning. Literacy and mathematical concepts are integrated daily throughout the environment and in children&rsquo;s play. A wide range of resources and materials are accessible to support children&rsquo;s imagination and encourage creativity. Good use is made of local community environments, including a native bush area, in close proximity to the playcentre. Children engage in learning through a range of meaningful contexts and have opportunities to be involved in sustained play.</p><p>Social interactions and relationships: Children experience responsive and reciprocal relationships with adults and their peers. Trusting and respectful social relationships are strongly evident, creating a warm, caring and positive atmosphere that fosters children&rsquo;s learning. Adults involve themselves in children&rsquo;s play and model effective communication skills when interacting with children and other adults. Children are learning effective social skills and encouraged to develop as capable and confident learners.</p><p>Parents as first educators: Families and playcentre-trained community members work well together in the best interests of children. Leadership roles and responsibilities and decision making are shared among playcentre members. Parents and caregivers work collaboratively, plan and regularly evaluate the programme they provide for children. They are encouraged to document their child&rsquo;s participation in centre experiences in individual portfolios. Self-review practices are established and encourage parents&rsquo; reflective thinking about the quality of education and care. These practices also lead to conversations about ongoing playcentre development.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>Long term self review: Parents have developed useful self-review practices that are focused on improvement. The 2012 strategic plan clearly identifies goals and objectives to further develop the quality of education and care. ERO and playcentre families agree that planned reviews could be strengthened by developing systems to document the processes and research undertaken to achieve their long-term strategic goals and objectives. This is likely to provide parents with more reliable information on which to base decisions about playcentre improvement.</p><p>M&#257;ori dimension: Playcentre families have identified that there is a need to develop a bicultural perspective within the educational programme. ERO agrees that it is necessary to increase the profile of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori as outlined in their 2012 strategic plan.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Arohena Playcentre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

The playcentre is located in attractive rural surroundings next to Arohena School. It provides sessional education and care for children from birth to school age. It operates under the umbrella of the King Country Playcentre Association (KCPA) and is affiliated to the New Zealand Playcentre Federation.</p><p>Children experience a well-prepared, interesting learning environment that is designed to encourage them to actively explore and learn through their play. Good use is made of local community environments, including a native bush area in close proximity to the playcentre. Children engage in learning in a range of meaningful contexts and have opportunities to be involved in sustained play.</p><p>The wider world of family and community is valued and integral to children&rsquo;s learning. The playcentre maintains close links with its community and local primary school. Trusting and respectful social relationships are strongly evident among children and adults, which creates a warm caring and positive atmosphere that fosters children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>The association provides comprehensive guidelines and an experienced centre support person to assist playcentre families to run the service. The playcentre is well led and effectively managed by a group of dedicated parents/caregivers. This collaborative approach to leadership is assisting parents to increase their knowledge and understanding of good practice for the education and care of children. The recently developed 2012 strategic plan clearly identifies goals and objectives to further develop the quality of education and care. Parents and caregivers are currently developing the bicultural dimension within the programme and playcentre systems for implementing and monitoring long-term self-review goals.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
