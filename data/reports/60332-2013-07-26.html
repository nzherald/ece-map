</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Early Years Tory St is operated by Kidicorp Limited. A business manager and professional services manager support the centre manager, who is responsible for daily operations. Children over two years and up to school age are educated by a teaching team, led by the centre manager and head teacher.</p><p>The service is licensed for 30 children. Families are offered the option of full-time, part-time or sessional education and care. Daily meals are prepared on site for children to eat in designated dining areas.</p><p>The June 2010 ERO report recommended strengthening learning partnerships with families and developing a team culture of self review. Since then there have been changes of teaching staff and in overall operation. The centre manager works with a team of fully and provisionally registered teachers and support staff. A culturally and ethnically diverse centre community contributes to establishing shared understandings about children's learning and wellbeing. Significant progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn and are cared for in a calm, settled environment. Teachers reflect on what they do to make learning appropriate for individuals. Planning includes using children’s interests, strengths and needs to develop a highly effective programme. Wall displays and portfolios show what children have learned and what they could learn next.</p><p>Teachers seek knowledge about the cultural background of children and are sensitive to how this is respected in centre practices. Many families communicate in their home languages. Staff show they value children’s identities and cultures through celebrating diversity. Families and staff continually share information and discuss children. This is especially demonstrated when changes to programmes and ways of doing things occur.</p><p>Learning through Māori culture and language is highly evident. Children sing waiata, say karakia and are involved in bicultural learning experiences. Children who identify as Māori are well supported to be successful as Māori learners. Teachers reflect on programmes, ensuring they are culturally appropriate, according to whānau expectations of what is best for their child.</p><p>Centre managers and staff should continue to explore their practices to support learning for Māori children as Māori.</p><p>Building relationships has been a priority. The collaboratively developed philosophy documents shared values that underpin positive learning experiences for children. Regular opportunities are planned for families, children and staff to share and have fun. These are valued by all.</p><p>Children cooperate and care for each other, assisting each other when necessary. They are able to manage themselves competently with appropriate support.</p><p>The centre manager models high quality teaching practice for the other teachers. She and Kidicorp managers are improvement focused and are committed to teaching and learning experiences that contribute to positive outcomes for all children.</p><p>Teachers plan strategies to support individual children’s specific needs and accommodate parents’ aspirations and preferences. Flexible routines are respectful of children’s rhythms and choices.</p><p>Kidicorp policies, procedures and managers contribute to a solid foundation for improving and sustaining the quality of education and care for children. Self review is understood and used well to bring about improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers recognise the need to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen teachers' knowledge of curriculum, through revisiting the principles and strands of <em>Te Whariki</em></li>
<li>more greatly reflect Pacific cultures within teaching and learning</li>
<li>continue to refine processes for undertaking evidence-based self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Early Years Tory St completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‘have’ or ‘have not’ taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Early Years Tory St will be in three years.</p><p><img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>26 July 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
