</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Pakuranga Baptist Kindergarten adjacent to the Pakuranga Baptist Church is a community-based kindergarten in East Auckland. It caters for children between two and five years of age. Half of the children enrolled have Chinese or another Asian heritage. Ten percent are Māori. The kindergarten has a Christian-based philosophy with a strong emphasis on family and community. The curriculum is also influenced by the Reggio Emilia approach that emphasises respectful relationships and views children as capable, competent learners.</p>
<p>The kindergarten is governed by a management committee that reports to the Church Board. The committee delegates daily management of the centre to the kaiwhakahaere, who is the professional leader. The kaiwhakahaere and teachers are all qualified and registered. Teachers are representative of the diverse cultures that make up the kindergarten’s community.</p>
<p>Positive aspects identified in ERO’s previous reports have been sustained over time. Respectful relationships, a responsive learning programme, the well-resourced learning environment and effective leadership practices remain features of the centre. Since 2012, teachers have continued to use robust self-review practices to enhance learning outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Creative and thoughtfully presented indoor and outdoor areas prompt children’s exploration and discovery. Flexible routines support their sustained, focused engagement in complex learning situations. As a result children are confident investigators who enthusiastically share their knowledge, ideas and theories about the world with teachers and other children. They show initiative, ask questions and self-direct their learning. Children are innovative thinkers who imaginatively identify solutions and solve problems.</p>
<p>Teachers form welcoming and positive relationships with children and their families. They interact respectfully with children, using conversations to prompt complex, independent thinking. Teachers skilfully integrate literacy, science and mathematical learning in meaningful ways. They listen carefully to children and provide resources to support and extend their learning. Developing team-wide strategies to further engage some of the older children could enhance the high quality programme.</p>
<p>The curriculum is highly effective in promoting positive outcomes for children. It integrates<em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, with a <em>Reggio Emilia</em> influence. Teachers are committed to developing bicultural practices and promoting success for Māori learners. They are participating in professional development to increase their knowledge of tikanga and use of te reo Māori in the programme.</p>
<p>Teachers value the information that parents share about their child’s home, community and cultural experience. Parents contribute their expertise to further enhance children’s learning opportunities at the kindergarten.</p>
<p>Systems to assess, plan for and evaluate children’s learning are high quality. Children’s strengths, interests and engagement in the programme are clearly shown in attractive learning records. These individual portfolios celebrate the language, culture and identity of children and their families. Teachers skilfully identify the learning that happens in play and the progress children make over time. They work together to respond to and enrich children’s individual and group experiences at the centre.</p>
<p>The kaiwhakahaere is a skilled, experienced professional leader. She is working with teachers to build shared leadership practices. There is a culture of professionalism and high expectations in all aspects of kindergarten operations. Robust self-review systems enable teachers to make positive changes to enhance children’s experiences at the centre.</p>
<p>A sound policy framework supports centre operations. This includes suitable systems to manage the collection, storage and use of personal information. The management committee is developing processes to increase parent representation on the committee and to support new members. ERO’s resource <em>He Pou Tātaki</em>, could be used to deepen committee members’ understanding of their governance role.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>To enhance the centre’s high quality practices the kaiwhakahaere and teachers agree they could link strategic goals with self-review, teacher appraisal and professional development to promote a more connected approach to guide centre developments.</p>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pakuranga Baptist Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p>
<p>The next ERO review of Pakuranga Baptist Kindergarten will be in four years.</p>

<h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p>
<ul><li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p>
<h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
