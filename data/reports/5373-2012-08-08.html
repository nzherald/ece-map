<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Paraparaumu Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and provides guidance and support to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>At Paraparaumu Kindergarten the recently reviewed philosophy, closely aligned to the early childhood education curriculum Te Wh&#257;riki, is highly evident in planning and teachers&rsquo; interactions. The programme promotes a community of learners and is based on children&rsquo;s developing interests and strengths.</p><p>An attractive, stimulating environment invites children to engage in purposeful play. Well-established routines provide a structure to the day and allow children to follow their interests as they engage in independent and group play. Sustainable and healthy practices are promoted. Te ao M&#257;ori is a feature of the environment, and te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori is effectively integrated into all aspects of the programme.</p><p>Long-serving staff work effectively as a collaborative team. Teachers are welcoming and caring and know children and their families well. Regular communication and consultation with the active parent community supports productive learning partnerships. Contributions are valued and celebrated.</p><p>Planned self review is well-focused and results in positive change and improved outcomes for children. Views of parents and wh&#257;nau are regularly sought and highly valued to inform direction. Explicit reference to appropriate research to measure success is likely to strengthen self review.</p><p>Teachers acknowledge the need to strengthen assessment practices. Clear links to parent aspirations, curriculum priorities and teachers&rsquo; actions, should more clearly demonstrate children&rsquo;s learning and progress over time.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Paraparaumu Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atParaparaumu Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4><em>Background</em></h4><p>ERO&rsquo;s April 2008 review, found that kindergarten staff provided a high quality learning environment and practices. Improvements in planning and assessment were required as well as teachers&rsquo; understanding and use of te reo M&#257;ori. Aspects of self review needed to be strengthened.</p><h4><em>Areas of strength</em></h4><p>The environment actively promotes the kindergarten&rsquo;s established curriculum priorities. Attractive and thoughtfully-placed learning spaces invite children to engage in stimulating learning opportunities which promote imaginative, independent and co-operative play. Children readily access a wide range of resources and move freely between indoor and outdoor areas to follow their interests. Natural resources and aspects of te ao M&#257;ori are well integrated into the environment. Physical features of the site have been used imaginatively to provide spacious and shady play areas.</p><p>A friendly and inclusive tone fosters involvement and creates a sense of belonging. Informative wall displays provide useful information for families. Individual portfolios are available for children to revisit and reflect on their learning. Parent-friendly areas promote opportunities for rich interactions and support children as they transition and settle into the kindergarten.</p><p>The programme promotes a learning community and is based on children&rsquo;s developing interests and strengths. Children select from a wide range of resources to engage in purposeful play. Te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori is strongly evident and integrated throughout the programme in meaningful ways. Routines support children&rsquo;s independence and enable smooth transitions between learning areas and activities. Regular group activities build on children&rsquo;s interests and support parent partnerships. Contributions of families are valued and celebrated.</p><p>Teachers are highly responsive and support children in their interactions. They engage children in conversations which build connections with their world. Children interact positively and work cooperatively to support each other in their play.</p><p>A well functioning, collaborative teaching team meets regularly to reflect on, assess and plan for children&rsquo;s learning. Planning is shared with families to promote learning partnerships and create a sense of community. Informative group planning stories document a range of rich learning experiences over time.</p><p>Individual portfolios celebrate children&rsquo;s participation in the programme and document their developing confidence and independence. Portfolios are freely accessible to families and provide a useful record of children&rsquo;s interactions, friendships and developmental milestones.</p><p>Self review follows a clearly documented process with well-focused, appropriate lines of enquiry. It provides some useful information for new direction, improvement and innovation. Reviews result in significant learning for teachers, positive change and improved outcomes for children. Views of parents and wh&#257;nau are regularly sought and highly valued to inform direction. A next step would be to include explicit reference to appropriate research when developing success indicators for self review.</p><h4><em>Areas for development and review</em></h4><p>A recent review of portfolios has strengthened assessment. Staff recognise the need to strengthen processes for responding to individual needs. This should include clear identification of children&rsquo;s learning and progress over time, and explicit links to parent aspirations, curriculum priorities and teacher actions.</p><h3>Association Support</h3><h4><em>Background</em></h4><p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy <em>Te Manawa</em>: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4><em>Areas of strength</em></h4><p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through <em>Te&nbsp;Manawa</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a wide range of professional development opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice as a result of feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Paraparaumu Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><p>8 August 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-paraparaumu-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Paraparaumu Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Paraparaumu Kindergarten.</p><p>Paraparaumu Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and provides guidance and support to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>At Paraparaumu Kindergarten the recently reviewed philosophy, closely aligned to the early childhood education curriculum Te Wh&#257;riki, is highly evident in planning and teachers&rsquo; interactions. The programme promotes a community of learners and is based on children&rsquo;s developing interests and strengths.</p><p>An attractive, stimulating environment invites children to engage in purposeful play. Well-established routines provide a structure to the day and allow children to follow their interests as they engage in independent and group play. Sustainable and healthy practices are promoted. Te ao M&#257;ori is a feature of the environment, and te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori is effectively integrated into all aspects of the programme.</p><p>Long-serving staff work effectively as a collaborative team. Teachers are welcoming and caring and know children and their families well. Regular communication and consultation with the active parent community supports productive learning partnerships. Contributions are valued and celebrated.</p><p>Planned self review is well-focused and results in positive change and improved outcomes for children. Views of parents and wh&#257;nau are regularly sought and highly valued to inform direction. Explicit reference to appropriate research to measure success is likely to strengthen self review.</p><p>Teachers acknowledge the need to strengthen assessment practices. Clear links to parent aspirations, curriculum priorities and teachers&rsquo; actions, should more clearly demonstrate children&rsquo;s learning and progress over time.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
