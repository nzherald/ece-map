<html><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Childsplay Unlimited Infant &amp; Toddler Centre is situated in the residential area of Mt Roskill, Auckland. The centre caters for children under two years of age in a modern, purpose-built facility. It shares its managers, management systems and premises with a centre that caters for children over two years of age.</p><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s August 2008 review of Childsplay Unlimited Infant &amp; Toddler Centre noted that managers and staff had taken steps to improve the learning environment and programme for children, and were committed to making further improvements. The positive changes noted in the 2008 ERO report have been further enhanced and children now enjoy a high quality programme in a supportive, motivating environment.</p><p align="left">Children are confident and enjoy the welcoming, family-like atmosphere of the centre. Teachers interact with children in respectful, caring ways, encouraging their independence and the development of their social skills.</p><p align="left">Perceptive teachers notice children&rsquo;s interests and use these to plan programmes. Wall displays document how teachers plan to extend children&rsquo;s interests and record their evaluations of the programme each week. In addition to portfolios and daily sheets, wall plans enable parents to know about their child&rsquo;s interests and learning progress.</p><p align="left">The owners are committed to providing a high quality early childhood service. They encourage staff to develop their expertise and continually seek ways to improve their own knowledge. ERO affirms the progress managers and staff have made and encourages them to use the centre&rsquo;s self-review processes to sustain and continue to improve outcomes for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Childsplay Unlimited Infant was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atChildsplay Unlimited Infant .</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s February 2008 review identified concerns about the centre&rsquo;s management systems, self review, programme planning, the quality of the environment and several aspects of health and safety.</p><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s supplementary review in August 2008 noted that the owners had contracted external advisors, attended workshops and seminars, and had taken positive steps to improve centre practices. ERO recommended that staff undertake professional development to establish assessment and planning practices that captured children&rsquo;s interests. ERO also recommended that the owners establish robust self-review and reporting systems. While health and safety issues identified in the February 2008 report had been addressed, several other areas were noted as concerns.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Commitment to improvement. The owners and staff are committed to providing a high quality service for children. They responded well to the February and August 2008 ERO reports and sought the assistance of external expertise to increase their professional knowledge and to improve the quality of children&rsquo;s learning experiences. Since the 2008 ERO report, they have:</p><ul>
<li>implemented ongoing self review of the centre&rsquo;s policies and procedures</li>
<li>undertaken professional development to improve programme planning, assessment and evaluation</li>
<li>implemented a staff performance management system</li>
<li>reviewed and improved the learning environment to meet children&rsquo;s interests and needs</li>
<li>addressed the health and safety matters noted in the August 2008 ERO report.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Confident children. Children are confident to approach adults and other children to make their needs known. They have excellent communication skills even though much of the communication is non-verbal. They settle quickly on arrival, and have a clear sense of belonging in the centre. They make good friends and enjoy being together with peers and teachers. Children challenge themselves and engage in sustained play while investigating, exploring or problem solving.</p><p align="left">Programme. Teachers plan the programme from children&rsquo;s interests and stages of development. Programmes are evaluated weekly by all staff as they reflect on current activities and improvements they could make. Routines are flexible so that they accommodate children&rsquo;s needs. Children have good support to learn appropriate social skills and to become independent learners. The programme is language rich, with teachers engaging in conversations and sharing books with children throughout the day.</p><p align="left">Learning environment. The centre provides a warm, welcoming and friendly environment for children and their families. Teachers respond to children with warmth and affection. Resources provided for children cater for their interests and different stages of physical development.</p><p align="left">Involvement of families. Parents are listened to and responded to. The information they bring is shared with all staff for the benefit of the child. They are kept up to date with their child&rsquo;s progress and learning as well as with centre events. Parents are encouraged to share aspects of their language and culture with staff so that staff can respond to children of different cultures in appropriate ways.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Centre owners, managers and staff have implemented many positive changes for children. The next steps they could consider reviewing are:</p><ul>
<li>additional ways of documenting in portfolios children&rsquo;s progress in learning or their continued interests</li>
<li>making portfolios more accessible to children</li>
<li>including centre and personal goals in staff performance appraisals and formalising feedback given to staff</li>
<li>reducing wait times for children at meal times.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Childsplay Unlimited Infant &amp; Toddler Centre currently has one child attending who identifies as M&#257;ori.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Staff have warm, respectful relationships with all children, including M&#257;ori children. They know parents and children well. They take time to talk to parents about what children are doing at home and share children&rsquo;s interests and learning at the centre with parents. This good daily communication enables staff to work in appropriate ways with children.</p><p align="left">The owners and staff have changed the centre charter and philosophy to include their commitment to providing for M&#257;ori students and promoting a bicultural New Zealand. Some staff use te reo M&#257;ori incidentally during the programme. Staff have identified they would like to further increase their knowledge of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori and one teacher is undertaking professional development to achieve this goal.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Childsplay Unlimited Infant completed an ERO Centre ManagementAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

The centre caters for children under two years of age in a modern, purpose-built facility. It shares its managers, management systems and premises with a centre that caters for children over two years of age.</p><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s August 2008 review of Childsplay Unlimited Infant &amp; Toddler Centre noted that managers and staff had taken steps to improve the learning environment and programme for children, and were committed to making further improvements. The positive changes noted in the 2008 ERO report have been further enhanced and children now enjoy a high quality programme in a supportive, motivating environment.</p><p align="left">Children are confident and enjoy the welcoming, family-like atmosphere of the centre. Teachers interact with children in respectful, caring ways, encouraging their independence and the development of their social skills.</p><p align="left">Perceptive teachers notice children&rsquo;s interests and use these to plan programmes. Wall displays document how teachers plan to extend children&rsquo;s interests and record their evaluations of the programme each week. In addition to portfolios and daily sheets, wall plans enable parents to know about their child&rsquo;s interests and learning progress.</p><p align="left">The owners are committed to providing a high quality early childhood service. They encourage staff to develop their expertise and continually seek ways to improve their own knowledge. ERO affirms the progress managers and staff have made and encourages them to use the centre&rsquo;s self-review processes to sustain and continue to improve outcomes for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Richard Thornton</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p align="left"><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
