</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Elm Row is a community-based early childhood centre providing full-day care and education for up to 40 children from birth-to-school age. The centre is centrally located in the city and children come from the wider Dunedin area.</p><p>The Elm Row philosophy says that teachers will provide a safe, fun and exciting learning environment for children. This is very evident in practice. Teachers plan programmes based on the early childhood curriculum, Te Whāriki.</p><p>Since the last review, teachers have significantly improved the layout and appeal of the indoor environment. They have also integrated younger children into the wider programme. The indoor and outdoor areas are safe, offer challenges and are easily accessible to children.</p><p>The centre has made good progress in addressing the areas for review and development identified in the 2011 ERO report. In particular in the way the team:</p><ul>
<li>seeks parents’ wishes for their children’s learning</li>
<li>has established a system for regularly planning for all children</li>
<li>has a better understanding of the purpose and processes of self review.</li>
</ul><p>This review was part of a cluster of five early childhood centre reviews in the Dunedin Community Childcare Association (DCCA).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whānau benefit from the caring and affirming relationships with teachers. Teachers actively seek and make good use of parents' views and wishes for their children’s learning.</p><p>There has been a deliberate focus on developing children’s social and emotional skills. This is evident in the way:</p><ul>
<li>children have strong friendships with one another</li>
<li>older children nurture and include younger children in their play</li>
<li>children play cooperatively with each other for sustained periods of time.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers actively join in and support children in their play. ERO observed teachers having meaningful conversations with children to extend and support their learning.</p><p>Children under the age of two are well provided for. Teachers are responsive and sensitive to their needs and implement flexible care routines. </p><p>The language, culture and identity of the six Māori children are valued. Teachers are effectively incorporating Māori concepts and language, and tikanga Māori practices and beliefs. Children enjoy opportunities to learn about significant events in the Māori calendar, such as Mātariki. </p><p>Teachers plan interesting and diverse programmes, based on their own strengths, that are responsive to children’s strengths and interests. They view children as competent and confident learners and capable of contributing to decisions about routines/play choices. Learning records show that children’s learning is enhanced by a wide range of experiences within the centre and the wider community. Older children’s learning is extended as they prepare to move to school. There are many opportunities for children to develop early literacy and mathematics concepts.</p><p>Teachers acknowledge their families’ diverse backgrounds and what children bring to the centre. Special family events are included in learning programmes. For example, children enjoyed celebrating one family’s tradition of a Greek Easter. </p><p>As part of this review, ERO considered how well children are being supported to become confident mathematical learners. ERO found there are many opportunities in the daily programme for children to learn mathematics, for example, learning concepts of measurement, weight and volume when baking. Teachers have had some professional learning to enhance their own knowledge of mathematics. Teachers acknowledge that they need to be more deliberate in how they support all children to become capable mathematics learners.</p><p>The recent introduction of an on-line portfolio system has been effective in giving families greater access to information about their children’s learning. Records of learning need to be strengthened. Teachers now need to ensure that individual and group planning more clearly identifies:</p><ul>
<li>the intended learning</li>
<li>the specific strategies/experiences they will provide for children to support this learning</li>
<li>what learning has occurred</li>
<li>how effectively they supported this learning.</li>
</ul><p>The head teacher is providing strong leadership. She makes good use of the strengths within the team and allows others to lead.</p><p>There is a useful framework for undertaking in-depth review. Recent reviews have led to positive changes and provided the content for other reviews. The team has a good understanding of the purpose of review and how it leads to improved outcomes to programmes and practices.</p><p>The team agrees that self review could be strengthened by being more evaluative and by sharing the outcomes of self review with parents and the governors of the DCCA.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre leaders agree that the key next steps are to strengthen planning and assessment and aspects of self review.</p><h3>Governance and Management of the DCCA</h3><p>The DCCA is governed by an executive committee and managed by a newly appointed director. The experienced and supportive executive:</p><ul>
<li>has a strong commitment to teaching and learning</li>
<li>has developed policies to guide practices within the centres</li>
<li>seeks the views of parents and staff</li>
<li>is more purposefully appraising its teaching staff, in particular against the registered teacher criteria.</li>
</ul><p>Head teachers appreciate the regular meetings as a group with the director.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review, the association has developed a useful framework for self review. The association management needs to ensure its practices and those of the centres are following the guidelines. Better implementation of the guidelines should lead to more effective identification of what is going well and what needs further development. Findings from self review should be an integral part of planning.</p><p>The executive committee has developed four aspirational strategic goals. The associated annual plan could be improved by setting out how each goal is to be specifically achieved. The association recognises the need for each centre to develop annual plans that align with the association’s priorities. More detailed plans would provide a useful basis for head teachers and the director to write their reports against and for the executive committee to monitor progress against.</p><p>The board needs to clarify the roles of the association management and leadership, including the director's responsibilities. This should help the achievement of the strategic plan.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Elm Row Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice the early childhood leaders should:</p><p>develop written procedures to guide the results of police vetting and the management of related risksimprove its practices for the assessment and management of risk for all excursions.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Elm Row Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>5 February 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
