</div><div class="WordSection3">
<p class="ReportText">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Greymouth is located in the West Coast rural township of Greymouth.&nbsp; The experienced and qualified teaching team work effectively together to cater for the learning and well-being of up to 30 children over two years of age.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The kindergarten is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed.&nbsp; It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety.&nbsp; The association incorporates a management layer in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who works in partnership with teachers providing ongoing educational leadership and professional development.</p>
<p class="ReportText">This review occurred at a time when the association, and the West Coast kindergartens, were responding to issues associated with the Pike River Mine disaster and the Canterbury Earthquakes during 2010 &ndash; 2011.&nbsp; The association and the kindergarten teachers have provided a high level of support to children and families.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Positive features of this kindergarten are the ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>teachers place a strong emphasis on providing a learning environment that is welcoming, appealing and fun</li>
<li>way parents support each other and get involved in their children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>way teachers model care and respect for one another and for children and families</li>
<li>a focus on oral language development and conversations with children encourage them to share their knowledge, find solutions to problems and plan to extend on ideas</li>
<li>the learning community and teachers work together to make substantial changes to the outside area that reflect the unique West Coast context, inspiring children&rsquo;s curiosity and exploration<b></b></li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">Teachers have developed a reflective culture. &nbsp;They make good use of effective self review that is focused on the ongoing improvement to teaching practices that extend on children&rsquo;s learning.&nbsp; Teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps are to continue to strengthen programme planning and assessment processes.</p>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">Future Action</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Greymouth was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO.&nbsp; ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff.&nbsp; This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKidsfirst Kindergartens Greymouth.</p>
<p class="ReportText">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education.&nbsp; For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Background</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">The teaching team&rsquo;s vision states that teachers will provide a learning environment that is welcoming, appealing and fun.&nbsp; It also states that teaching and learning practices will be child-initiated, child-directed and adult supported.&nbsp; Teachers will foster relationships with wh&#257;nau/family, kaiako/teachers and the community that involve all contributing and participating with teaching and learning.&nbsp; They emphasise that Te Wh&#257;riki, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum, strongly underpins teaching and learning programme.</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Areas of strength</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Teachers warmly welcome children, parents and wh&#257;nau and foster positive, inclusive relationships.&nbsp; They listen carefully to parents and work with children in ways that show sensitivity to the cultural needs of them and their families.&nbsp; The teachers highly value the participation and contributions parents/wh&#257;nau make to the children&rsquo;s learning and assessment and to self review.&nbsp; During the review, many parents, some with younger children, were comfortable to stay and be involved in the kindergarten session and enjoy the company of other parents.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Teachers work with children in caring, positive and empowering ways.&nbsp; They are actively involved in children&rsquo;s play and learning.&nbsp; Teachers encourage children&rsquo;s efforts, offer challenges and celebrate their successes.&nbsp; Teachers make good use of questioning.&nbsp; They provoke children&rsquo;s thinking skills and encourage them to find solutions to problems.&nbsp; They make decisions about planning to develop children&rsquo;s ideas.&nbsp; Teachers consistently model care and respect for one another and for children.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and well-being. &nbsp;During the review, children played very well with and alongside others for sustained lengths of time. They shared ideas, played cooperatively and enjoyed friendships with one another.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Teachers have built up an effective team culture that includes reflective professional discussions that are focused on the ongoing improvement to teaching practices and learning outcomes for children.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Teachers are highly responsive to the individual needs and interests of children within a child-initiated and directed programme.&nbsp; Children benefit from long periods of uninterrupted time to make their own discoveries and develop ideas.&nbsp; Children are well supported to take responsibility for themselves and the environment and to care for others.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Parents and wh&#257;nau are well informed about children&rsquo;s interests and participation in the learning programme through attractively presented profile books and wall displays. &nbsp;Teachers are currently developing professional working relationships with schools to share information that is likely to support positive transition processes for children.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Since the last review, the teaching and learning community has worked together to make substantial changes to the external environment.&nbsp; It now strongly reflects the unique West Coast context and inspires children&rsquo;s curiosity and exploration. Children benefit from spacious, well-maintained and appealing learning areas.<b>&nbsp; </b>A wide range of learning experiences and resources are presented in ways that invite children&rsquo;s interest and participation.&nbsp; Teachers encourage appropriate physical challenges for children. &nbsp;They provide opportunities for children to care for animals and to learn about the natural world and sustainable practices.</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Area for development and review</h4>
<h5 class="MSHeading4">Assessment and planning</h5>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Teachers have developed a reflective culture that is focused on making the ongoing improvement to teaching practices that extend on children&rsquo;s learning.&nbsp; Teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the kindergarten&rsquo;s next steps are to continue to strengthen:</p>
<ul>
<li>future planning of teaching and learning strategies for individual children&rsquo;s assessments that add depth and complexity to children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>how learning progress is shown</li>
<li>the use of assessment information to inform programme planning</li>
<li>parent access to information about programme planning and facilitating their input and involvement.</li>
</ul>
<a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Greymouth completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist.&nbsp; In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">During the review, ERO looked at the kindergarten&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures.&nbsp; ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>

</div><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-greymouth" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 class="CommunityPageHeader">To the Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Greymouth</h2><p class="ReportText1stPara">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on&nbsp;Kidsfirst Kindergartens Greymouth.</p><p class="ReportText">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Greymouth is located in the West Coast rural township of Greymouth.&nbsp; The experienced and qualified teaching team work effectively together to cater for the learning and well-being of up to 30 children over two years of age.</p><p class="ReportText">The kindergarten is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p class="ReportText">The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed.&nbsp; It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety.&nbsp; The association incorporates a management layer in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who works in partnership with teachers providing ongoing educational leadership and professional development.</p><p class="ReportText">This review occurred at a time when the association, and the West Coast kindergartens, were responding to issues associated with the Pike River Mine disaster and the Canterbury Earthquakes during 2010 &ndash; 2011.&nbsp; The association and the kindergarten teachers have provided a high level of support to children and families.</p><p class="ReportText">Positive features of this kindergarten are the ways:</p><ul>
<li>teachers place a strong emphasis on providing a learning environment that is welcoming, appealing and fun</li>
<li>way parents support each other and get involved in their children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>way teachers model care and respect for one another and for children and families</li>
<li>a focus on oral language development and conversations with children encourage them to share their knowledge, find solutions to problems and plan to extend on ideas</li>
<li>the learning community and teachers work together to make substantial changes to the outside area that reflect the unique West Coast context, inspiring children&rsquo;s curiosity and exploration<b></b></li>
</ul><p class="ReportText">Teachers have developed a reflective culture.&nbsp; They make good use of effective self review that is focused on the ongoing improvement to teaching practices that extend on children&rsquo;s learning.&nbsp; Teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps are to continue to strengthen programme planning and assessment processes.</p><h3 class="MSHeading2">Future Action</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><p class="ReportText">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take.&nbsp; You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p class="ReportText1stPara">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the kindergarten or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.&nbsp;</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 class="MSHeading2">GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3 class="MSHeading2">About ERO</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3 class="MSHeading2">About ERO Reviews</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews.&nbsp; The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p class="ReportText">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s &nbsp;self review.</p><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Focus</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a kindergarten, may be included in the review.&nbsp; ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this kindergarten has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.<b></b></li>
</ul><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Coverage</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of a kindergarten&rsquo;s performance and each ERO report may cover different issues.&nbsp; The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this kindergarten.</p><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Recommendations</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement.&nbsp; A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a kindergarten is performing poorly in relation to that issue.&nbsp; There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this kindergarten.</p></html>
