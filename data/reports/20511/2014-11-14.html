</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>White Heron Learning Centre - Manurewa is one of four privately owned early childhood centres. The centre is licensed to provide education and care for 50 children, including up to 15 under two years of age. Most children who attend the centre identify as Māori.</p><p>The centre provides programmes for children in two age groups in separate buildings. At the beginning of the day the groups come together for karakia and waiata and at the end of the day they play as a mixed age group.</p><p>The centre’s owner and leaders have a strong commitment to providing quality early childhood education opportunities for children in the local community. The appointment of the supervisor to oversee two White Heron centres, and head teachers for each age group, has extended leadership capacity within the centre.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy focuses on providing opportunities for children to become confident in their cultural identity. It recognises the development of the whole child as important to establishing a positive attitude and approach to learning.</p><p>Many of the positive features identified in the 2011 ERO report continue to be evident in the centre. ERO recommended that managers strengthen self-review processes and extend opportunities for literacy and mathematics learning within the programme. Progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a good sense of belonging in the centre. They look forward to attending and playing together. Children confidently engage in conversations with each other and with their teachers.</p><p>Teachers affirm and encourage infants and toddlers and provide good models for children’s language development. Infants and toddlers select their own play and participate in activities that interest them.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers know centre families and their community well. They are committed to providing a caring and supportive learning environment for the children. Parents provide information about their aspirations for their children and their expectations of the centre. Centre leaders use this information as a basis for making decisions.</p><p>Bicultural practice is a strength of the centre. Whanaungatanga and manaakitanga underpin relationships. Teachers model and promote te reo Māori me ōna tikanga well. They use te reo incidentally for instructions and conversations, as well as for karakia and waiata. This good practice supports a real sense of identity for Māori children.</p><p>The property and learning environments are attractive and well maintained. Play areas are organised to encourage children to play and explore freely. Teachers need to ensure children have access to sufficient resources in all learning areas to create their own play. Spacious, refurbished outdoor areas for both age groups promote opportunities for children to play without interruption.</p><p>Teachers work well together. They value the strengths that individuals bring to their roles. Strong and trusting relationships between teachers allow them to challenge each other professionally.</p><p>Teachers plan learning opportunities for children. They use the emerging interests of individuals to inform planning for the larger group of children. Teachers group children of similar ages together at times during the day so they can focus on developing appropriate skills.</p><p>The owner and centre leaders share common understandings about the role of early childhood education in children’s lives and about teaching practices that benefit their learning. They work well together to promote supportive learning environments that respond to the needs of the centre’s families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To strengthen the implementation of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, managers and teachers agree that they need to consider the role of the teacher in:</p><ul>
<li>child-directed play that will promote learning</li>
<li>fostering individual children’s interests</li>
<li>promoting creative, complex and sustained play.</li>
</ul><p>Centre leaders plan to:</p><ul>
<li>link the appraisal system to expectations for teachers’ practice</li>
<li>extend self review to explore the effectiveness of initiatives in promoting positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of White Heron Learning Centre - Manurewa completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of White Heron Learning Centre - Manurewa will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>14 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
