</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waitaki Valley Preschool is a small rural centre on the grounds of the local school in Kurow. Many of the children travel significant distances from isolated areas to attend. They benefit from opportunities to socialise and enjoy experiences outside their everyday lives.</p><p>A dedicated teaching team provides education and care for up to 31 children during school terms. A business manager is responsible for the day-to-day management of the preschool. The centre is governed by a capable board.</p><p>Since the May 2012 ERO review the board and teachers, with the help of external support, have made many positive changes to all aspects of the centre’s practices and operations. Board members now have a better understanding of their roles and responsibilities. The teachers have improved programmes and practices in the preschool.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play and learn in well-resourced indoor and outdoor areas that encourage them to be creative and explore. They and their families benefit from the nurturing and supportive relationships they have with the teachers. Children play well with and alongside each other.</p><p>The teachers have thought carefully about how they can best support children’s learning. They have created an inviting area that allows infants and toddlers to be safe while still being part of the older children’s activities. They provide a programme that is strongly based on Te Whāriki – the Early Childhood Curriculum.</p><p>This includes children:</p><ul>
<li>being supported to learn through their play</li>
<li>having many opportunities to learn early concepts of literacy, mathematics, science, music and art</li>
<li>learning about their local community and developing a sense of belonging to it</li>
<li>benefitting from the way their teachers nurture their health and wellbeing</li>
<li>frequently hearing and using te reo Māori and learning about aspects of tikanga Māori.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers listen to children’s ideas and use these to build children’s knowledge and thinking. They support children to develop social skills and strong friendships. Routines and transitions within the centre and to school are well managed and responsive to each child’s needs. Teachers encourage families to share their diverse cultural backgrounds within the centre. Children benefit from learning about each other’s culture. Teachers are developing a deeper understanding of how to support the wellbeing and learning of Māori children.</p><p>The teachers have improved planning and assessment processes to clearly show the intended learning and teaching and the progress children are making. Teachers have identified that they need to find ways to make this process more manageable and to show how they gather and respond to parents’ wishes for their children’s learning.</p><p>The board, leaders and teachers work very well together. They are developing useful systems and planning to ensure the smooth operations of the centre. The head teacher has introduced a more purposeful appraisal system designed to meet the requirements of trained teachers. The teachers are improving their knowledge and use of self review. They should report the findings of self review to the board so that trustees can monitor and evaluate how well the centre is promoting positive outcomes for children. The next step for the board is to make sure that reviews of policies and the strategic plan are more evaluative and evidence based.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps have been identified by the board, centre leaders and teachers. ERO agrees that they are to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop self-review practices</li>
<li>refine aspects of planning and assessment</li>
<li>consolidate and embed the systems and planning that support the centre’s efficient operations.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waitaki Valley Preschool Incorporated completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waitaki Valley Preschool Incorporated will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>21 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
