<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Simply Kids Preschool is well placed to continue promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Simply Kids Preschool is a privately owned centre that provides full day care for 28 children up to five years of age. Children come from the local community in Onerahi, Whangarei.</p><p>The centre operates in a semi-rural setting close to native bush, which teachers use to extend learning opportunities for children. The outdoor area has been developed to provide space for play as well as an enclosed space for a variety of small farm animals and domestic pets to support children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Four of the staff, including the owner who works part time as a teacher, are provisionally registered. They receive support and guidance from registered teachers outside the centre.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children are warmly greeted and encouraged to make choices from a wide range of good quality resources and materials. The pace of the day is unhurried and calm, allowing children to settle easily and enjoy opportunities to play together. Children benefit from opportunities to explore their own creativity and to engage in imaginative and dramatic play. They have opportunities to learn about literacy, numeracy and science concepts in meaningful situations. Children are developing their understanding of the natural world and some knowledge of environmental issues.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively, sharing leadership for different aspects of the programme. Programmes are based on a culture of respect for children and their wh&#257;nau. The curriculum is based on Te Wh&#257;riki, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, and is strongly influenced by the local context.</p><p>Relationships with parents/wh&#257;nau are well established. Teachers include a significant amount of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori in programmes to recognise the heritage of M&#257;ori children attending the centre. A particular focus has been on M&#257;ori accounts of the history of the Onerahi area. Children are able to sing complex waiata with understanding and enthusiasm. Parents expressed their pleasure in the positive learning for their children.</p><p>Children learn in an attractive environment that supports their sustained engagement in play in a mixed-age group. Infants and toddlers are integrated smoothly into the programme and the opportunities for children to practise tuakana/teina relationships support their well developed social competency. Children&rsquo;s play is enhanced by frequent, respectful conversations with teachers. Teachers could now consider ways of encouraging children&rsquo;s independence in the programme.</p><p>Teachers are developing an understanding of planning, assessment and evaluation processes. Children&rsquo;s portfolios are attractive accounts of their participation in the programme, and include some information provided by parents. It would be useful for teachers to explore ways of linking assessment and planning to more clearly demonstrate how the programme supports and develops children&rsquo;s individual interests and strengths and reflects parents&rsquo; aspirations for their children.</p><p>The owner and teachers are establishing self review as a purposeful, meaningful tool for improving practice with a present review focus on policies and procedures. Teachers have undertaken detailed investigation of aspects of the programme in order to strengthen their practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the owner agree that the key next steps for the centre are to continue to develop:</p><ul>
<li>a statement of shared philosophy about teaching and learning</li>
<li>the complexity of children&rsquo;s play by extending conversations to prompt children&rsquo;s thinking and problem-solving</li>
<li>children&rsquo;s independence and self management</li>
<li>more robust review for evaluating the effectiveness of programme practices.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Simply Kids Preschool completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>18 June 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
