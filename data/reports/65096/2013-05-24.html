<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>ABC Parklands is becoming better placed to promote and improve positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>ABC Parklands has been owned and administered by Kidicorp Education and Care Centres since September 2011. The centre provides education and care for children from three months to school age in separate nursery and preschool areas. Nearly all staff are qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>Since the 2009 ERO review, there have been significant staff changes, including changes in centre manager. The new team has established a culture that is strongly focused on children&rsquo;s wellbeing and building positive relationships with the children and their families.</p><p>Redevelopment of the outdoor play areas to provide more natural play spaces remains a high priority for managers and teachers as identified in the 2009 ERO review report. The damage caused by the 2010 and 2011 Christchurch earthquakes has affected how quickly improvements to the play areas can occur.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children are benefiting from improved relationships within the centre and with the wider community. Teachers place a strong emphasis on welcoming the children and their families. They encourage parents to spend time in the centre and share useful information about their children.</p><p>The managers and teachers, in consultation with parents, have redeveloped the centre philosophy to better reflect their beliefs about children&rsquo;s learning. As a result, teachers now have clearer expectations for learning and teaching. They are beginning to integrate these values into the programme and their work with children and families.</p><p>Children in the nursery experience a calm and unhurried programme. Teachers respond sensitively to each child&rsquo;s interests, needs and preferences. They skilfully talk to infants and toddlers about their play and include te reo M&#257;ori in these conversations. They provide additional resources to extend children&rsquo;s play and enjoyment. Infants and toddlers appear happy, settled and sociable.</p><p>Children in the preschool are well supported to develop positive social skills. Teachers respond to children&rsquo;s interests and provide additional resources to support these. Children have good opportunities to hear and use te reo M&#257;ori in some aspects of the programme, such as group times.</p><p>The centre manager identifies and makes good use of teachers&rsquo; individual strengths to build leadership capability and to extend children&rsquo;s learning opportunities.</p><p>Kidicorp and centre managers work together to provide clear direction to the team. They are making good use of the well-developed Kidicorp management guidelines to identify where improvements should occur. There are clear links between future planning, organisational self review, staff appraisal and professional development. These systems and practices should help to ensure that ongoing improvements to learning and teaching continue.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Kidicorp and centre managers have identified and ERO agrees that the next steps to improve learning and teaching include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening self review</li>
<li>developing and putting into practice new assessment and planning processes</li>
<li>finding out more about M&#257;ori parent expectations, including cultural aspirations for their children and incorporating this into plans and the programme</li>
<li>using the beliefs for high-quality teaching outlined in the new philosophy statement to help teachers effectively extend children&rsquo;s thinking and problem-solving skills.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Parklands completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select &lsquo;have&rsquo; or &lsquo;have not&rsquo; taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>24 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
