</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Katikids Educare is located in the township of Katikati, north of Tauranga. The service is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 75 children, including 40 aged up to two years. At the time of this review, 30 Māori children attended.</p><p>The service philosophy emphasises respectful relationships, partnerships and a curriculum that fosters exploration and challenge. Since the June 2015 ERO report, renovations to the building and an upgrade of the outdoor environment have occurred. There has been a number of changes to staffing. Most teachers are qualified.</p><p>Katikids Educare, previously known as Katikati Childcare Centre, was purchased by Provincial Education Group in March, 2016. Provincial Education Group Limited (the organisation) provides governance and management support. A substantial management team oversees a number of services nationwide. This includes a professional leader who provides support and guidance to centre staff. Te Tiriti o Waitangi principles are central to the organisation's philosophy and practices.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified areas for improvement for the service. These included: deepening teachers' knowledge of good practice and assessment; clarifying the role of leaders; and providing greater financial support for resources and renovations. Since the organisation has taken ownership of the service, improvements have been made to the physical environment, resourcing and in the support provided for teachers to improve their practice. Progress is ongoing.</p><p>This review was one of a cluster of seven services in the Provincial Education Group Limited.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in self-initiated play. Teachers provide resources and an environment that engages children in their learning through respectful interactions. Infants and toddlers have the time and space to lead their learning. Teachers are responsive to their emerging interests and care needs. A next step is for leaders to provide an increased level of guidance to teachers to support them to be more intentional in recognising and responding to children’s learning.</p><p>The philosophy has recently been revisited with leaders and teachers. They are developing indicators of good practice to guide and support the effective implementation of this. As part of this process leaders and teachers should investigate, how best they can effectively engage with whānau Māori and their Pacific community to understand parent, family and whānau aspirations for educational success for these children.</p><p>Bicultural practice is in the early stages of development. Teachers are committed to building their knowledge of te ao Māori. Further consideration should be given to how leaders can support teachers to increase and integrate their use of te reo Māori in their daily interactions with children and their families.</p><p>Children’s portfolios highlight children’s engagement in the programme, their developing friendships and show their emerging interests. Building a shared understanding of what high quality assessment practice for learning looks like is an important next step. This should then guide teacher practice, help leaders to monitor expectations and inform centre planning.</p><p>The appraisal process provides a sound framework for teachers to reflect on and improve their practice. Further consideration should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the setting of specific, measurable and aspirational goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly identifying the purpose of any observations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reflecting all aspects of the Education Council’s expectations for appraisal.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>A well-considered process for internal evaluation is in place to improve practice. Leaders should continue to build teacher evaluation capabilities to enable them to better measure the effectiveness of the curriculum and in promoting outcomes for children.</p><p>A recent parent survey has provided some useful guidance to leaders about how they needed to enhance centre practices. The next step is for them to develop a plan of action to guide ongoing improvements.</p><p>The organisation's senior leadership has high expectations for teacher practice. Systems and processes are in place to promote improvements, for the benefit of children and whānau. Teachers are encouraged to grow their understanding and take on distributed leadership roles.</p><p>A well-considered policy framework is in place to guide teacher practice. The organisation places considerable emphasis on the health, safety and wellbeing of children.</p><p>The organisation has recognised the importance of providing formal feedback to teachers from their visits and a reporting process is currently being developed.</p><p>Leaders agree to provide a stronger focus on building teacher capability and pedagogical leadership to promote high quality outcomes for children. Areas of priority include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment for learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>intentional teaching practice, including the use of rich oral language and adding depth and complexity to children’s learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation for improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Essential to these key next steps is the targeted support and pedagogical guidance from the professional leader. ERO and leaders agree that the priority next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further develop the bicultural programme and explore how success for Māori children as Māori and success for Pacific children can be promoted in the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the philosophy and develop clear indictors of quality to guide teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a shared understanding of high quality assessment practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen appraisal to reflect the Education Council New Zealand requirements and build the evaluative capability of teachers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO and Provincial Education Group Limited agree that to further strengthen practice, their next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establish nationally consistent reporting frameworks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitor the progression of strategic goals, through evaluation of improved outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use formal internal evaluation processes at senior leadership level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase opportunities for whānau to actively contribute to the organisation’s strategic direction.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>The service has provided ERO with an action plan to show how the key next steps will be addressed. ERO will request progress updates.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Katikids Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Katikids Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>12 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
