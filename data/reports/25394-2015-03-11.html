</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Highbrook provides education and care for 150 children with up to 75 under 2 years of age. The centre’s philosophy focuses on children learning in a stimulating environment with real experiences that involve problem solving, decision making and risk taking.</p><p>The Lollipop Educare organisation provides a wide range of governance and management systems to underpin centre operations. These include professional guidance, curriculum advice and a mentoring programme for provisionally registered teachers. A professional services manager visits the centre regularly and provides professional advice and support for leaders and teachers.</p><p>There are nine rooms in the centre. Children come together for meals in the centre’s wharekai. Parents work nearby but many live well outside the immediate community. The multi-ethnic teaching team reflects the diversity of children's families.</p><p>This is ERO’s second review of this centre. Leaders addressed recommendations made in the 2011 ERO report through whole staff professional development and teacher appraisal.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Highbrook promotes highly effective learning outcomes for children. Children and their whānau are well supported by teachers to transition positively into the centre. Teachers share with parents the importance of children learning through play and the value of play in preparing them to be lifelong learners.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to the needs and interests of children. They recognise the importance of consistency and continuity in the care and education of young children. Primary caregivers for individual children contribute to the secure foundation for children’s development within the centre. Adults trust children to develop as independent learners. They provide a calm pace that allows infants and toddlers the appropriate time and space to follow their own interests.</p><p>Children are settled in the centre. They are trusted to make their own choices and have established genuine friendships with teachers and their peers. They are becoming competent communicators and confidently articulate their interests and needs to adults. Familiar routines and centre organisation, support children’s sense of wellbeing and belonging. They demonstrate good self-help skills.</p><p>Children under two years of age are confident explorers. They happily engage in play and activities with their peers and are learning appropriate ways to manage their relationships with each other. They are confident and comfortable with teachers and participate willingly during group times.</p><p>Teachers know children and families well. They show a strong commitment to valuing children’s language, culture and identity, recognising individual strengths and knowledge, and family aspirations. Teachers encourage children to learn at their own pace providing periods of uninterrupted play to enable them to repeat or sustain an activity.</p><p>Teachers provide a varied range of experiences for children. While they plan separately for infants and toddlers, there is continuity in planning and careful transitioning as children move between rooms. Teachers plan meaningful learning activities, which are responsive to the interests and perspectives of children and whānau. The programmes include opportunities for children to learn more about tikanga Maori.</p><p>Through professional development, teachers are becoming increasingly confident in their understanding and use of te reo Māori me ona tikanga. They recognise the importance of continuing to provide opportunities to support the culture, language and identity of all children and to consider ways to foster Māori children’s identity.</p><p>Teachers share children’s learning with parents and families. They identify each child’s strengths and interests and plan for their growth and development. Parents can see in the stories about children's learning how children are developing over time. Parents can also contribute to their child’s portfolio of learning. Literacy, science and the arts are integrated throughout the learning programme supporting children to become lifelong learners. Quality work capturing children’s reflections is displayed throughout the centre. Older children are extended in their art and dance and movement.</p><p>Children enjoy playing in the well-resourced, expansive outdoor environment where they develop their physical skills and explore the adventure style setting. Teachers change the equipment and areas of play to suit children’s current interests. Children respect their environment and appreciate the varying levels of challenge the outdoor space provides for them. Centre leaders continue to review the impact of the restrictive fencing in the outdoor play area.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre is well led by a management team focussed on improving outcomes for children. They review centre systems and support teachers to review their teaching practice. They work hard to realise parent’s social, cultural and learning aspirations through strategic planning.</p><p>ERO and centre managers also agreed that next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>deepening teachers self enquiry to improve their own teaching practice</li>
<li>reviewing the curriculum to increase children’s learning in mathematics</li>
<li>reviewing the philosophy across the centre</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Highbrook completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lollipops Educare Highbrook will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>11 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
