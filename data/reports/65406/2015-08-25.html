</table><p>Country Kids Childcare Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Country Kids Childcare Centre is a well-established community-based education and care service that caters for children from birth to five years of age. The centre’s philosophy focuses on providing children with meaningful experiences in a safe and fun learning environment.</p><p>The centre has three rooms to provide age-appropriate activities and care. However, programme flexibility enables children to move between rooms and socialise with younger or older children.</p><p>Centre management and staff have built close ties with the local community. Teachers recently joined a learning cluster that strengthens professional relationships and support children’s positive transition to school.</p><p>The board of trustees which is made up of elected parent and community representatives works closely with the centre management team to support children and staff.</p><p>The centre has maintained the strengths outlined in the 2012 ERO report. Staff have made good progress in addressing the areas recommended for development including improvements to self review, teacher appraisal and assessment.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play and learn in a positive and caring environment. They are encouraged to help and care for each other. Infants and toddlers are well supported to become independent and confident learners. Older children are appropriately challenged by new experiences and questions that enhance their problem solving skills.</p><p>Literacy, mathematics and art are well-integrated into the centre programmes. Teachers readily respond to children’s needs, abilities and interests. They value and use many of the ideas shared by children to enhance the centre programme. Children have many opportunities to learn beyond the centre environment.</p><p>Teachers respectfully use children’s prior knowledge to enrich the learning of others. Learning stories are well written and acknowledge the child as a capable learner. The stories clearly show the wide range of interesting learning experiences teachers provide for children.</p><p>Children experience positive and caring relationships in a welcoming environment. Teachers value children’s cultural backgrounds and place great importance on inclusive practices. They are aware of the steps to take to meet the specific learning needs of any child who may enrol at the centre.</p><p>There is a strong focus on incorporating bicultural perspectives into the programme. Children are able to hear and use te reo Māori often throughout the programme.</p><p>The centre is well-led and managed. The management team is very well supported by an external advisor from another early childhood organisation. The team works collaboratively with staff to meet the needs of the children.</p><p>Staff benefit from selected professional development targeted to meet their needs. They have a shared understanding of self review which they use to make ongoing improvements to their practice and to the centre programme.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers and ERO agree that the next steps to improve learning outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>refining the strategic plan to make the centre priorities more manageable over time</li>
<li>aligning the appraisal process to the new Education Council requirements</li>
<li>considering ways to deepen children’s learning and use assessment information to enhance teacher planning</li>
<li>sharing information about children as learners as part of their transition to school.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Country Kids Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Country Kids Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>25 August 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
