</table><p>Gladstone Pre-School is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Gladstone Pre-School provides all day education and care for children from birth to five years old, five days a week. It is licensed for up to 63 children, including up to 24 under two. Children are cared for and learn in two adjacent 'houses', one for children under two and a half years old and one for older children.</p><p>The preschool is one of two services owned by the director. She is responsible for the operations and governance of both preschools. Senior teachers oversee teaching and learning in each house. The majority of teachers at Gladstone Pre-School are experienced and qualified and have worked there for a significant length of time.</p><p>Through its curriculum and teaching practices, teachers aim to support children to become confident, competent learners and effective communicators. They also seek to support all children to develop a sense of belonging and wellbeing, with reciprocal, respectful relationships, inclusive attitudes and critical thinking skills.</p><p>Since ERO's 2015 report, good progress has been made on most of the areas for development identified in the preschool's last report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's interests, strengths and needs are very well responded to through teaching practices and the curriculum. Teachers:</p><ul>
<li>pay careful attention to the interests and developmental age and stage of children</li>
<li>purposefully set up the learning environment to provide opportunities for challenge and extension</li>
<li>foster and follow children's initiative in their play</li>
<li>support children's developing independence and decision-making.</li>
</ul><p>Very young children also have choice and challenge in their learning environment. Infants' and toddlers' wellbeing is carefully supported by nurturing relationships with their teachers. Parents' and whānau aspirations for their children's care and learning are regularly sought and incorporated into learning programmes and routines.</p><p>Teachers could better show in children's learning stories the difference their intentional strategies have made to children's outcomes.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have been building shared understandings of the vision and values of the preschool and this is providing greater direction and guidance for teacher practice. Other benefits of this initiative include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>consultation with parents and whānau about what learning matters to them, and a focus on 'sharing' curriculum with families more effectively</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increased professional collaboration for curriculum design</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers inquiring into what works to promote positive outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the increasing visibility of learning priorities in assessment and planning documentation for individual children and groups.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children benefit from a broad curriculum that effectively promotes their learning across a range of areas. They are well supported to develop respectful, reciprocal relationships with other children and their teachers. They have many opportunities to develop early literacy and numeracy skills and knowledge.</p><p>Teachers have built their understandings of New Zealand's bicultural heritage. They are using this, together with partnerships with whānau and local marae, to affirm and respond to children's cultural identities, and to provide all children with opportunities to experience and learn about New Zealand's indigenous Māori culture.</p><p>The director is committed to providing the conditions for effective early education and care. Since ERO's 2015 report she has:</p><ul>
<li>strengthened reporting systems, to be better assured of children's health and safety</li>
<li>strengthened teacher appraisal processes</li>
<li>supported teachers to build their capability to deliver a bicultural curriculum, and implement Te Whāriki (2017), The NZ Early Childhood Curriculum</li>
<li>supported teachers to undertake internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><p>The director could make better use of internal evaluation to be assured about the implementation of the two preschools' values and how well children are progressing and achieving. The director needs to consider options for improving the consistency of professional leadership across her services.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To better enact the director's vision of high quality care and education, the director needs to improve the consistency of professional leadership across her two preschools to ensure effective practice and desired developments are well implemented.</p><p>To continue to build the rigour of internal evaluation, the director, leaders and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure that they adequately evaluate current practice before they move onto planning new developments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use indicators of effective practice to support judgements about quality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>systematically collect and analyse evidence of teaching practice to 'test' findings.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation processes have been strengthened, however some variability in process and quality across the director's two preschools remains. To continue to strengthen assessment and planning practice, leaders and teachers need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>better document and evaluate teachers' planned strategies to extend and progress children's learning, for individuals and groups of children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop quality assurance systems and guidelines for assessment and planning, in both preschools, that reflect the service's indicators for effective practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Gladstone Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the preschool needs to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen processes for identifying and managing hazards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>include planning for emergencies in risk management planning for excursions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>involve parents more in regular review of preschool policies and procedures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider cultural perspectives when reviewing policies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure teachers have formal observations of practice as part of appraisal.</p>
</li>

ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
