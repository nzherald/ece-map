</table><p>Lollipops Greenlane is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Greenlane is located on the grounds of Alexandra Park in Greenlane and provides for children up to school age. Infants' and toddlers' rooms are located on the lower level of the building and older children occupy the upper level.</p><p>The centre's philosophy states that they aim to provide children with a "quintessential Kiwi experience" of "wonder, exploration and learning". Teachers aim to provide a holistic curriculum that promotes children's interests and social competence.</p><p>Good progress has been made with the next steps outlined in the service's 2015 ERO report. New staff appointments and strategic planning have promoted ongoing centre improvement.</p><p>The centre is part of the Evolve Education Group’s Upper North Island region. Evolve provides an overarching governance and management framework. The intent of a recent re-branding of Evolve services has been to build a greater sense of unity across the organisation. It has allowed each centre to identify a preferred philosophical approach.</p><p>Recent Evolve initiatives are intended to improve staff retention, promote effective internal evaluation and lift the quality of teaching practices. A new general manager and area managers provide professional support for centre leaders and teachers. Further recruitment is underway for managers to lead a focus on continuing quality improvement across the organisation. There continues to be a period of transition for staff as they adapt to changes in Evolve operational practices.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the Evolve Education Group, Upper North Island region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Families and children are warmly welcomed on arrival. Children settle quickly, reflecting the centre's ethos of being "where inclusion, culture and tolerance support learning to thrive". Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and ownership in their environment.</p><p>Infants and toddlers up to two years of age are cared for in a nurturing and caring environment. They have very good access to equipment and environments that encourage their learning. Teachers' practice reflects a "pedagogy of care" and provides infants with learning opportunities within care routines. Children make choices about their learning and demonstrate a secure sense of self.</p><p>Older children are keen inquirers and have meaningful conversations with each other and with adults. They play for sustained periods of time, respectfully and confidently playing alongside each other.</p><p>Teachers interact well with children. They listen, ask and respond to questions in ways that help to develop children's language and problem solving skills. Supporting children to develop more complex play would benefit their learning.</p><p>Teachers provide good opportunities for children to learn and develop physical competencies and resilience. Outdoor environments have recently been renovated to resemble natural bush settings. Children enjoy the challenge and intrigue that this setting provides. They confidently explore elements that promote sensory, creative and imaginative play in both indoor and outdoor environments.</p><p>Teachers know the children well, and respond to the needs of individual children with sensitivity. Responsive, child-centred planning drives the curriculum. Teachers are increasingly using a cycle of programme planning, assessment, and evaluation that is responsive to children's interests and makes learning visible. Teachers have good partnerships with families, whose contributions are evident in children's individual development plans (IDP). Photographs of children and their families are displayed on the whakapapa wall.</p><p>The centre is well led and managed. Policies are robust and regularly reviewed. Regular appraisal supports teachers to build their professional practice. The centre manager initiates relevant professional learning and is a positive influence on teachers' practice. Purposeful internal evaluation includes multiple sources of relevant information and contributes to identifying actions for improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Next steps for centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to distribute leadership across the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further developing teachers' bicultural practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing greater consistency across planning and assessment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During ERO’s August 2018 cluster, Evolve Education Group Managers agreed that next steps included:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increased integration of the principles of <em>Te Tiriti o Waitangi</em> and the alignment of strategic goals and annual plans with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitoring the roles and responsibilities of leaders at organisation and centre levels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the effective implementation of appraisal practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This current cluster review also identified the need for:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a coherent change management strategy, and monitoring the effectiveness of the new structure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support for centres through changes of key leaders, including area and centre managers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the evaluation of teaching and learning across the organisation, to inform the next steps in PLD and the development of the teaching and learning teams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>high quality PLD for area managers to help them to evaluate and promote quality provision for children, and to identify priorities for supporting centre managers.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Greenlane completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>3 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
