</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>PORSE Bay of Plenty/Rotorua S1 is a standard home-based education and care network operating under the umbrella of PORSE In-Home Childcare Network (NZ) Ltd. It is one of four PORSE networks operating in the Bay of Plenty/Rotorua area. Of the 74 children enrolled, nine are Māori.</p><p>The PORSE vision is, ‘expanding the hearts, minds and wellbeing of a nation through nurturing child-care in-home’.</p><p>Qualified and registered programme tutors work alongside educators and nannies to implement and support learning programmes for children in homes with a focus on care and education. A national team provides governance and management support for all PORSE services.</p><p>PORSE offers two options for education and care. The home educator model where the educator works in their own home; and the nanny educator model where an educator works in the children's home. In this network all educators have at least a level three qualification in early education and care.</p><p>Since the March 2011 ERO review, PORSE In-Home Childcare Network (NZ) Ltd. has changed ownership. The Evolve Education Group Limited (EEG Ltd) purchased PORSE in September 2014. Existing structures for national and community team management have continued through the change of ownership. The PORSE senior leadership team, who are responsible for operations, report to the EEG Ltd board of directors.</p><p>The ERO 2011 report identified key next steps in relation to bicultural practices, self review, assessment practice, resourcing and health and safety. There has been significant development in relation to bicultural resources, health and safety systems and practices, and self review.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews in PORSE In-Home Childcare Bay of Plenty/Rotorua.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Parent aspirations for their children are strongly reflected in the design of the curriculum and its implementation. Partnerships with parents and whānau are respectful and reciprocal. Programme tutors have a key role in facilitating responsive care arrangements between educators and families. These partnerships contribute to children's wellbeing and secure relationships with their educator.</p><p>Children benefit from child-centred teaching and learning practices in a small family-like setting. Relationships between families, children, educators and programme tutors are meaningful and affirming. Inclusive processes and practices ensure children with additional needs and their families are well supported. Individual needs are carefully considered when pairing educators and children. Transitions into and beyond the service are well managed. These are responsive to each family and support continuity of care and wellbeing for children. Experiences for children up to two years are enhanced through small and intimate home settings, where a culture of respectful care is highly evident. Educators know children well and effectively respond to individual routines, needs and interests.</p><p>A feature of the PORSE curriculum are the real-life home experiences that promote meaningful literacy and mathematics learning to support and extend children’s emerging interests. Additional resourcing provided by PORSE is well-use to supplement and enhance in-home learning. Programme tutors and educators access a wide range of resources that support educators and children's learning about the Māori language and culture. Children have extensive opportunities to make connections, explore and learn in the wider community. Participation in a number of organised groups and outings enables them to socialise, problem solve and try new things in a wider group of adults and children.</p><p>Assessment for learning is developing. Some individual assessment records provide good evidence of children’s identity, interests, dispositions and learning overtime. Assessment records are easily accessible to whānau and families to view and reflect on their children's learning.</p><p>Regional leaders provide effective and targeted support and coaching for programme tutors. This fosters ongoing professional learning and leadership opportunities within the service. Leaders empower programme tutors to work collaboratively across networks and to reflecting on and grow their own and educators practice. The annual appraisal process further supports educators to develop their practice through self assessment, feedback from programme tutors and families, and goal setting. Leaders have a strong commitment to effective teaching and learning that contributes to positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>Strategic goals and self review clearly focus on enhancing positive outcomes for children and their families. A range of relevant and up-to-date policies guide health and safety practices in homes. There are clear systems, framework and expectations for performance management. A deliberate and responsive approach to training for educators along with ongoing professional learning and development is growing the capability of educators to consistently promote positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and service leaders agree that PORSE needs to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>use self review to more deliberately to design and implement a localised curriculum in each network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>formalise the attestation process for registered teachers, monitor appraisal goals in an ongoing way and ensure that evidence is linked to the appropriate teaching standards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the service’s vision and philosophy to reflect the bicultural nature of Aotearoa and align to <em>Te Whāriki</em> 2017.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Service leaders and programme tutors need to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>advice and guidance to educators in relation to regulatory requirements and appraisal goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the deliberate modelling of effective assessment for learning strategies.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that PORSE accesses professional learning and development for programme tutors to strengthen their understanding of Education Council requirements for teacher registration and appraisal.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of PORSE Bay of Plenty/Rotorua S1 completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of PORSE Bay of Plenty/Rotorua S1 will be in three years.</p><p>Adrienne Fowler</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>2 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
