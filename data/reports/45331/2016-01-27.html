</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Jemmas Homebased Childcare Morrinsville is licensed to provide all day home-based education and care for up to 80 children between birth and school age. It has an office located in Morrinsville and covers a large geographical area in the Waikato and Bay of Plenty. Children are placed in family homes with one educarer, who can have up to four children at any one time.</p><p>Jemmas has been established since 2000, and is a privately owned and operated service. It operates seven networks in Auckland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty. Management restructured and established a new governance board in 2015, and appointed a team leader, who oversees the Waikato and Bay of Plenty networks. This is a standard funded network where educarers are untrained.</p><p>The quality of education in this network is overseen by two coordinators, one of whom is also a team leader. The coordinators have remained consistent since the 2012 ERO review. They are experienced, qualified and registered teachers who work as a collaborative team. Their role is to regularly visit children in educarers' homes and provide leadership that promotes positive outcomes for children's wellbeing and learning.</p><p>Coordinators have had access to professional development to keep up-to-date with current research in early childhood education. Educarers are offered training workshops, facilitated by a knowledgeable team leader, to support them in their role as educators. A grandparent/whānau programme was introduced this year to encourage and support the education and care of children by their grandparents, under the guidance of Jemma's policies and procedures.</p><p>The service has a vision to provide high quality home-based childcare within safe, caring and nurturing environments. The philosophy for learning is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The areas identified for improvement in the 2012 ERO report have been addressed. There remains a need for the service to continue developing systematic self-review processes. This should enable leaders to make reliable, evidence-based decisions about the effectiveness of service operations, particularly in relation to children's wellbeing and learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Coordinators have a sound understanding of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, and provide effective guidance and strategies for educarers to implement the early childhood curriculum. Children benefit from the support provided by coordinators during regular visits to children in homes. The visits include professional discussions that assist educarers to understand children's development and how they learn within the context of close, respectful and trusting relationships in a family-like setting.</p><p>Individual learning story portfolios celebrate children's participation in the home-based setting. Children's oral language and literacy development are well documented. Many learning stories show that children's social and communication skills are being successfully fostered. Coordinators document learning stories for children, which model effective practices in assessment, within the service's expectations. Parents are invited to contribute to these and many do. These portfolios show that children experience a rich variety of learning experiences in the educators' homes and the local community setting.</p><p>On-line portfolios have been a recent initiative undertaken by the team leader. The trial involves a small group of educarers and families. This is resulting in collaborative sharing of children's experiences and the development of deeper learning partnerships among families, educarers and coordinators. Management are currently exploring the possibility of extending on-line portfolios throughout the service.</p><p>Coordinators regularly communicate with parents/whānau through educarers, email and by telephone. The service is yet to provide families with formal opportunities to contribute to the development and review of the service's operations.</p><p>Educarers are provided with extensive resources and equipment from the service to support with care, as well as extend children's interests and learning. This includes resources that promote te ao Māori and bicultural practices. Management promotes a strong emphasis on literacy and encourages educarers and families to access books from the service's library. Educarers are expected to participate in community playgroups, and other outings and events in the local community. This provides children and educarers with opportunities to socialise with, and learn alongside others.</p><p>The owner/operations manager has regular meetings and reflective conversations with team leaders about improvements to the service. She annually visits educarers' homes and monitors how the service's expectations are being met. The board receives informative reports from coordinators and team leaders about systems and practices. The board has established a clear business strategic plan. This plan should be strengthened to include goals that directly link to positive outcomes for children's care and education.</p><p>The team leader has been instrumental in identifying policies and procedures requiring review and development. She is in the process of updating documentation to ensure legislative requirements are met.</p><p>The appraisal of coordinators is aligned to the registered teaching criteria and undertaken annually. The service is in the process of documenting clear, comprehensive procedures to guide appraisal practice including:</p><ul>
<li>specific goals focused on the coordinators' coaching role to build educarers' professional capability to provide positive outcomes for children </li>
<li>ongoing and regular reflection, and monitoring of progress made by coordinators in meeting their professional goals</li>
<li>targeted observation of coordinators' practice.</li>
</ul><p>These processes are in the early stages of implementation.</p><p>Management has established robust recruitment processes to select new educarers and gives careful consideration to matching educarers with families. This includes supporting Māori children's culture, language and identity by endeavouring to place children with educarers who have knowledge of te reo and tikanga Māori. There are some effective systems, processes and practices to ensure health and safety legislation requirements are met. These include providing educarers with appropriate tools to undertake their roles and responsibilities for the education and care of children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service has identified, and ERO agrees, that there is a need to continue strengthening effective quality assurance processes that provide staff with documented guidelines for emergent, planned and strategic self-review. This is necessary to enable the service to implement ongoing self-review to monitor, evaluate and improve all areas of service operations, particularly in relation to positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Jemmas Homebased Childcare Morrinsville completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Jemmas Homebased Childcare Morrinsville will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>27 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
