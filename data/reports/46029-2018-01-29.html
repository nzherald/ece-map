</table><p>The July 2014 ERO report identified a number of areas for development. The centre provided ERO with an action plan for the key next steps. There is limited evidence to show these were adequately addressed and many remain priorities for improvement.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Waiwhetu, in Lower Hutt, came under the umbrella of Evolve Education Group in 2014.</p><p>The service is licensed for 75 children including 25 aged up to two years. At the time of this ERO evaluation there were 62 children on the roll, including eleven Māori. Many families with children attending have English as their second language. There are four rooms within the centre catering for infants through to four year old children.</p><p>The centre has recently experienced a number of staff changes particularly in the management positions.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five reviews in the Evolve Education Group.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in an environment that is child-centred. Teachers work positively to focus on developing and promoting children's interests. Educators know children well and make links to their home experiences. Consequently, children demonstrate confidence and are encouraged to lead their learning.</p><p>Infants and toddlers enjoy their own spaces and familiar surroundings. The programme is flexible and allows them to make choices about their involvement in the wide range of experiences. Adults understand the importance of secure attachments and work alongside these very young children and their families. Close partnerships are formed.</p><p>The centre philosophy, planning and assessment require further development. The teaching team has recently begun to review the centre philosophy. This should establish a collective understanding of what is important for children in the service.</p><p>Assessment and planning for children's ongoing learning is also being reviewed. Teachers identify and focus on children's interests, making links with families that build relationships with parents and whānau. Parents contribute to their children's learning through the developing learning stories, which are the centre's assessment tool.</p><p>There is a focus on building the capability of teachers to lead learning. Staff appraisal and attestation of teachers' Practising Certificates do not meet expected requirements.</p><p>A recent restructure within Evolve has led to the introduction of new management roles that aim to provide increased support for centre staff. Staffing changes have been unsettling for staff and centre leaders have been required to do considerable work to develop and maintain a sense of stability across the service.</p><p>Evolve managers should continue strengthening systems to provide ongoing guidance and support to centre leaders and teachers for continuous improvement of teaching and learning. There is some way to go for the centre to be well placed regarding the documentation of assessment, planning and evaluation to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Next steps to improve the quality of teaching and learning are to develop and strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation to promote positive learning outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self review and internal evaluation for ongoing improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support for teachers to develop consistent high quality practices through effective appraisal and goal-setting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a vision and philosophy that identifies the services curriculum priorities for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Waiwhetu completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to self review and appraisal. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implement an ongoing process of self review to help the service maintain and improve the quality of education and care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement a system of regular appraisal.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>[<em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA 6, GMA 7]</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lollipops Educare Waiwhetu will be within two years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>29 January 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
