</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kea Kids Childcare is one of eight centres owned and operated by Ferns Education Limited. It provides all-day care and education for up to 73 children, including 13 aged under two years. Most children who attend the centre are Māori. The roll also includes Indian children and children with Pacific heritage.</p><p>The philosophy of the centre values cultural diversity and is based on a belief that "children are unique and are a special taonga" entrusted to the centre's care.</p><p>A centre director, operations manager and area manager have oversight of centre governance and management. A centre manager works with two team leaders, four registered teachers, two relievers, a nutritionist, an administrator and a van driver.</p><p>ERO's 2016 report suggested improvements in the area's curriculum, leadership capability, appraisal and health and safety. The Ministry of Education has supported the centre to develop an action plan addressing improvements in these areas. Some progress has been made and leaders recognise the need to continue improvements in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and interact confidently with each other and adults in a supportive environment. Children under two years of age have their own indoor and outdoor spaces. Toddlers and older children have separate indoor spaces and share a common outdoor space allowing for mixed-age play.</p><p>Infants and toddlers experience programmes that are responsive to their individual care and learning needs. Older children engage independently in play, choosing from a range of relevant resources and experiences in a prepared environment. Displays make it possible for children and parents to revisit learning experiences.</p><p>Teachers intentionally engage children in conversations to help build trust and rapport. They should review the extent to which they observe, listen, and respond to what children are thinking, feeling, and wanting to do. This would enhance children's sense of themselves as competent learners, leading their own play and learning.</p><p>Morning karakia times include all children. A sense of family is fostered as children have opportunities to interact with their siblings and others. Teachers use te reo Māori, as well as Pacific and other languages. Teachers could further strengthen the enactment of their philosophy by supporting all children's pride in their own cultural identity.</p><p>Leaders and managers are knowledgeable and support teachers to develop an understanding of good quality assessment and planning. Assessments have improved over time and identify dispositions and interests. Some portfolios show continuity of learning and teachers' responses to parent aspirations.</p><p>Teachers collaborate with parents, whānau and external agencies to promote positive outcomes for all children, including those with additional needs. Parents appreciate teachers' efforts to support their children's learning and development.</p><p>Leadership appointments have been strategically made. Leaders have established effective management and working relationships. They have recently developed a strategic vision, goals and plans, and a format for internal evaluation. They are working towards these priorities.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have accessed relevant professional learning and development. The new appraisal process aligns with Education Council requirements. Leaders expect that this process will support teachers to improve teaching practices and outcomes for children.</p><p>Policies and procedures have been recently reviewed to ensure they meet requirements. Some improvements have been suggested.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review and adapt the centre's philosophy to reflect teachers' current thinking and align with <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement and embed the appraisal process to improve teaching practices and outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support teachers with developing high quality assessment and planning processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a shared understanding about internal evaluation and measuring the impact of reviews on teaching practice and outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kea Kids Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kea Kids Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>18 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> <i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
