<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">The Bear Park Pre-School and the adjoining Bear Park Infant/Toddler Centre - Albany are part of the Bear Park group of early childhood centres. The franchise management team provides advice, audit and management support to centre owners within the group to ensure compliance with legal, regulatory and franchise expectations.</p><p align="left">The centre provides good quality care and education for children within a programme that is strongly influenced by the Reggio Emilia philosophy and Te Whariki, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum.</p><p align="left">Children experience high standards of care from supportive and affectionate staff. They are confident learners and display a strong sense of belonging in the centre. Children&rsquo;s independence and self management is promoted through their keen participation in the learning programme. They are articulate, enjoy social contact with their peers, and make strong friendships. Children are engaged and focused in play and sustain long-term interests in investigations.</p><p align="left">Teachers&rsquo; interactions with children are respectful and supportive. Inclusive teaching practices enable all children to participate fully in the programme. Teachers present and use the attractive environment thoughtfully and effectively to promote children&rsquo;s learning. They give children many opportunities to revisit past learning experiences, and enable them to add challenge and further extend their learning.</p><p align="left">Practical planning procedures are used effectively. Centre managers actively support staff to plan, assess and evaluate children&rsquo;s learning collaboratively. Project work shows how in-depth learning occurs for children over an extended period of time.</p><p align="left">Relationships with parents are a strength of the centre. Parents are kept well informed about their children&rsquo;s progress through daily conversations, formal meetings, emails and children&rsquo;s individual learning records. Parents report a high level of satisfaction with the quality of care provided for their children.</p><p align="left">ERO and managers agree that teachers&rsquo; next step in programme planning is to make planning for ongoing learning more clearly evident in learning stories. Developing strategies based on Ka Hikitia, the Ministry of Education M&#257;ori strategy for success for M&#257;ori, should further support and improve learning outcomes for M&#257;ori children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Bear Park Pre-School was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atBear Park Pre-School .</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In addition, In keeping with usual practice for centres under new ownership and management, ERO decided to evaluate the quality of the centre&rsquo;s management systems.</p><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Since the 2008 ERO report the Bear Park Pre-School and Bear Park Infant/Toddler Centre - Albany has come under new ownership. The centre manager and the owner have worked collaboratively to enhance centre practices and to develop further the professional relationships and team work amongst staff. This report evaluates teaching, learning and management practices in the infant and toddler centre.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Positive outcomes for children. Children experience high standards of care from supportive and affectionate staff. Their strong sense of belonging is reflected in their understanding of teachers&rsquo; expectations for their involvement in routines and the learning programme. Children&rsquo;s independence is promoted, especially at meal times. Children are confident speakers and enjoy social contact with their peers. Friendships are strong and of mutual benefit. Children are engaged and focused in activities and sustain long-term interests in group project work.</p><p align="left">Teaching practices. Interactions with children are respectful and supportive. Inclusive teaching practices enable all children to participate fully in the programme. A recent focus on using equipment and recyclable materials in open-ended ways has helped to develop children&rsquo;s creative ideas and theories about how things work. Teachers provide children with many opportunities to revisit past learning experiences and use these as opportunities to add challenge and further extend children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p align="left">Learning environment. Teachers present and use the environment thoughtfully and effectively to promote and celebrate learning. The indoor environment is characterised by the use of household items, recycled and natural resources, wooden furniture, soft draping and cushioning. Equipment is attractively displayed and play areas have been planned to support opportunities for large and small group play. Teachers ensure that children are given opportunities to play outside all year round. Plantings and access to animals help children to develop awareness of the importance of gardening and of caring for living creatures.</p><p align="left">Programme management. Practical planning procedures are used. Teachers record children&rsquo;s individual and group learning experiences in portfolios. Centre managers provide a generous allocation of time for staff to assess children&rsquo;s learning collaboratively and to document planning each week. Records of project work show how in-depth learning occurs for children over an extended period of time.</p><p align="left">Partnerships with wh&#257;nau and community. Teachers have developed strong relationships with families and the community. Community experts are sought to support children&rsquo;s learning in specific project work. Parents are well advised about how to support their child&rsquo;s transition into and between centres. Opportunities are offered to parents to meet formally so that parents can engage with teachers in indepth discussions about their children&rsquo;s progress. In addition, parents are kept informed about children&rsquo;s progress through daily conversations, individual records and portfolios, and email contact. Parents report a high level of satisfaction with the quality of care provided for their children.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Further support for children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers take an active role in leading group learning situations. They could now encourage children&rsquo;s ownership of their learning by supporting them to further develop their identified interests. A next step in programme planning is for teachers to make the next steps for learning evident in individual and group learning stories.</p><h3>The Quality of Management</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Bear Park Pre-School operates under a Bear Park franchise agreement that provides comprehensive management systems to support the operation of the centre. Bear Park systems are being systematically reviewed and aligned with the 2008 Early Childhood Licensing Criteria in preparation for relicensing.</p><p align="left">The centre manager and the new owner have worked collaboratively to further enhance centre practices and to develop a strong culture of inclusive professional relationships and staff team work.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Management systems. The Bear Park management systems are well embedded in centre practice. They include:</p><ul>
<li>policies and procedures that are reviewed over a two year period</li>
<li>strategic and annual plans, which are reviewed regularly</li>
<li>regular safety checks and repairs that are completed in a timely manner</li>
<li>effective systems for the efficient management of finances</li>
<li>personnel systems, including appraisal processes, that are well developed and are regularly reviewed</li>
<li>a regular professional support and provisional teacher registration programme.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Self review. While sound review procedures have been developed using Ministry of Education&rsquo;s Guidelines for Self Review, procedures are not always well documented. Staff and centre managers could now consider how they could make self-review processes more clearly evident to all staff and parents.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3><p align="left">Nine children of M&#257;ori heritage are enrolled in this service.</p><p align="left">Managers have recently become aware of the Ministry of Education&rsquo;s strategy of managing for success for Maori children, as outlined in Ka Hikitia.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p align="left">Transition practices. High value is placed on effective communication with families. Good systems are in place for parents to meet individually with teachers to discuss children&rsquo;s progress and to interact at centre events and social occasions. Regular strategies for welcoming M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau into the centre could now be developed.</p><p align="left">M&#257;ori culture in centre practices. Staff are beginning to use te reo and waiata in the programme and recognise the importance of affirming the culture and language of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau. Teachers have begun to take te reo classes to build an understanding of M&#257;ori language and culture and so that they can enrich the programme for children. These good practices are likely to make M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau feel more connected with the centre.</p><h3>Area for development and review</h3><p align="left">Continuing to develop meaningful relationships. Managers and teachers should continue to use their strength in building relationships with families to connect meaningfully with M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau. They could also use Ka Hikitia as a tool to identify ways of improving the programme so that it promotes further success for M&#257;ori children as M&#257;ori learners.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4.

<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-bear-park-pre-school" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Bear Park Pre-School</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Bear Park Pre-School .</p><p align="left">The Bear Park Pre-School and the adjoining Bear Park Infant/Toddler Centre - Albany are part of the Bear Park group of early childhood centres. The franchise management team provides advice, audit and management support to centre owners within the group to ensure compliance with legal, regulatory and franchise expectations.</p><p align="left">The centre provides good quality care and education for children within a programme that is strongly influenced by the Reggio Emilia philosophy and Te Whariki, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum.</p><p align="left">Children experience high standards of care from supportive and affectionate staff. They are confident learners and display a strong sense of belonging in the centre. Children&rsquo;s independence and self management is promoted through their keen participation in the learning programme. They are articulate, enjoy social contact with their peers, and make strong friendships. Children are engaged and focused in play and sustain long-term interests in investigations.</p><p align="left">Teachers&rsquo; interactions with children are respectful and supportive. Inclusive teaching practices enable all children to participate fully in the programme. Teachers present and use the attractive environment thoughtfully and effectively to promote children&rsquo;s learning. They give children many opportunities to revisit past learning experiences, and enable them to add challenge and further extend their learning.</p><p align="left">Practical planning procedures are used effectively. Centre managers actively support staff to plan, assess and evaluate children&rsquo;s learning collaboratively. Project work shows how in-depth learning occurs for children over an extended period of time.</p><p align="left">Relationships with parents are a strength of the centre. Parents are kept well informed about their children&rsquo;s progress through daily conversations, formal meetings, emails and children&rsquo;s individual learning records. Parents report a high level of satisfaction with the quality of care provided for their children.</p><p align="left">ERO and managers agree that teachers&rsquo; next step in programme planning is to make planning for ongoing learning more clearly evident in learning stories. Developing strategies based on Ka Hikitia, the Ministry of Education M&#257;ori strategy for success for M&#257;ori, should further support and improve learning outcomes for M&#257;ori children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Richard Thornton</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region</p></html>
