</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rocket Kids Early Learning Centre is an independently owned education and care service. It operates from a converted villa and has purpose built spaces for older children. Infants have their own indoor and outdoor play spaces. Toddlers occupy their own indoor area and share the outdoor play area with older children.</p><p>The managing director is supported by a leadership team comprising a pedagogical leader and a recently appointed staffing leader. This team works alongside seven other teachers. Over 90% of the teaching team are qualified teachers<em>.</em> The diversity of the community is reflected in the teaching team, which has changed significantly in recent months.</p><p>The service philosophy states that it values empowerment, encouragement, extension, emotional and physical wellbeing, and partnership with families and caregivers. Sustainability is a strong strategic focus of the team.</p><p>The 2015 ERO review acknowledged the strong relationships between parents and teachers, the collaborative teaching team, and respectful relationships between children and teachers. These have all been sustained. One of the areas for development included further strengthening bicultural practice and there has been good progress in this area.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled. They interact positively with their peers and teachers. Friendships between children are developing while they play in small groups. Teachers and leaders know their children well and effectively support them to develop their interactive and social skills.</p><p>The teaching team warmly welcome children and whānau. Teachers work to respond to the needs of individual children and ensure their wellbeing is prioritised. They provide respectful and responsive care for infants and toddlers. Teachers provide good opportunities for children to be leaders throughout their day.</p><p>Teachers use an on-line assessment tool to share children's learning with whānau. Most parents are comfortable to use this portal as an opportunity to engage with teachers and read learning stories with children at home. Teachers gather parent aspirations for children's learning and are working to include these in programme planning.</p><p>Teachers respectfully use te reo Māori with children. They include waiata and karakia at group and meal times. Teachers have made te reo Māori visible on the walls to support their growing use and confidence with the language and to share this with families. Teachers and leaders are committed to upholding the values of te Tiriti o Waitangi and weaving bicultural experiences throughout the programme.</p><p>Parents actively contribute to the programme by sharing their languages and cultures. Leaders, teachers and parents respond well to the needs of the wider community and support local initiatives. The centre is aware of these needs and opportunities through their positive whānau connections.</p><p>Teachers are beginning to use children's interests and strengths as the basis for programme planning. Leaders are working collaboratively to support teaching teams to embed a well-designed programme planning process that effectively captures the learning of individual children. Portfolios of learning could be more reflective of each child's individual learning journey.</p><p>The managing director has established a clear strategic direction for the service. She continues to review and enhance systems, including teachers' appraisal and internal evaluation. Leaders could now benefit from relevant professional learning focused on change management processes to effectively lead the centre through this time of growth.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for ongoing development include the leadership team:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen internal evaluation to support the centre through this time of change and growth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embedding the planning and evaluation framework with a continued focus on the learning of individual children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>revisiting the centre's evaluation of environments to ensure all children are able to access a wide range of quality resources.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rocket Kids Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rocket Kids Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>3 August 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
