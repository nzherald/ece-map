</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Avondale Christian Kindergarten is an education and care service operated by the Reformed Church of Avondale Trust Board. The kindergarten is run by a management committee. It is a part of the church’s community outreach programme and is situated on the same site as the church and an associated school. Since the last ERO report there have been significant changes to the leadership of the centre. A new centre manager and a new head teacher have been appointed.</p><p>The kindergarten provides sessional and full-day care and education for up to 45 children over the age of two years. The centre has a roll of 62 children, half of whom are NZ Europeans. The other half of the roll have mainly Asian or Indian heritage. There are five Māori and ten Pacific children. A large number of the Asian and Indian children are non-English speaking when they enrol.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children. It has maintained strengths identified in ERO’s 2010 report including the well-resourced learning environment, children’s positive engagement in learning and socialisation through play, and the good levels of support adults provide for children and their whānau. The ongoing development of these strengths shows that they are now well embedded in the kindergarten’s programme.</p><p>ERO’s 2010 report gave clear direction to the kindergarten staff about some important steps needed to further improve the programme provided for children. The new leaders have effectively used the report information, along with regular self review and their combined professional knowledge, to make significant changes within all aspects of the kindergarten’s operations. These changes impact positively on the children and their learning.</p><p>The management of changes within the kindergarten has been strategically prioritised, carefully planned and skilfully implemented. Decision making processes are inclusive, collaborative and consultative of all involved, including the children. Parents are well informed about the new directions being taken within the kindergarten. Staff engage in appropriately targeted internal and external professional development to build their teaching capacity.</p><p>Children now have access to a new, interesting and challenging outdoor play area. Children’s voices and contributions are strongly evident in learning records and in planning displays. Early literacy and numeracy learning is promoted in ways that are appropriate for children’s developmental levels and reflect the intent of the early childhood education curriculum. Children are receiving more responsive and targeted learning opportunities as a result of teachers’ improved planning and assessment procedures.</p><p>Children and their families are well served by the kindergarten. Children benefit from the affirming relationships they have with staff and each other. They are content and well cared for. They demonstrate high levels of trust in the adults around them, and approach adults with confidence. Children enjoy a well ordered and interesting learning environment that invites their participation.</p><p>Children’s Pacific and Asian cultural heritages are acknowledged and celebrated. Bicultural resources, topics, displays and practices support the success of Māori children. All children are advantaged by the centre’s strong language-based programme. Teachers talk often with children, using their home language where possible to support children’s understanding and new learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The areas for improvement currently targeted by leaders and teachers are tightly focused on maximising children’s learning opportunities and on enhancing the quality of those opportunities. To further support these directions, ERO and kindergarten staff agree that teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>continue to build on their understanding and application of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, especially as it refers to child-led learning</li>
<li>promote children’s active engagement and participation in shorter mat times</li>
<li>continue working on the progress made in planning children’s individual learning pathways</li>
<li>plan more directly to promote positive learning outcomes for Māori and Pacific children and children who are new speakers of English</li>
<li>encourage and support the participation and positive learning outcomes of children from low income families.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Avondale Christian Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Avondale Christian Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>20 November 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
