</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Awatuna &amp; Districts Playcentre is one of 17 parent-led early childhood centres administered by the Taranaki Playcentre Association (the association). A management team of elected volunteers oversees operation at governance level and provides the adult education programme, guidance and support for members.</p><p>The playcentre is licensed to provide mixed-age sessional education and care for 30 children two days a week. This includes 15 children up to the age of two.</p><p>Centre supporters are employed by the association to regularly visit playcentres. Their role is to provide professional advice and feedback to strengthen practice and promote improvement. Responsibility for day-to-day operation is undertaken by centre-elected office holders. Parents share the duties associated with implementing the programme.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation is planning a significant restructure for 2017 that includes amalgamating all playcentre associations. Playcentres will become part of a regional hub, supported by a regional manager and support persons.</p><p>The association and centre philosophies support parent-led education and child-initiated play. These beliefs are valued by centre members and reflected in practice. The principles and strands of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum underpin practice to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The March 2014 ERO report for the playcentre identified that improvement was needed in self-review processes, assessment for learning and programme planning and giving increased significance to te ao Māori. Progress is evident to varying degrees in all areas. Assessment, programme planning and internal evaluation continue to require strengthening.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews in the Taranaki Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre members work collaboratively to provide a welcoming, inclusive learning environment for children, families and caregivers. Adults recognise the importance of developing positive relationships with each other and knowing all children well.</p><p>Programmes for children are clearly aligned to <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum and are responsive to child-led initiatives. Portfolios highlight children’s interests and experiences. Their creative art work, pictures and descriptive narratives increasingly enhance these records. Some inclusion of parent and child voice provides collaboration and continuity between the centre and home.</p><p>Indoor and outdoor spaces encourage children to learn, explore, develop their physical skills and engage in imaginative, creative play. The thoughtfully organised environment successfully provides for the physical and emotional wellbeing of very young children. Early literacy and numeracy learning opportunities are effectively integrated in the programme and environment.</p><p>Children engage in learning confidently and make decisions about their involvement and participation. Flexible routines support children's sustained and purposeful play. Learners' are well supported by adults who engage in conversations that promote language development, exploration, thinking and problem-solving.</p><p>Thoughtfully considered strategies support children and their families’ induction into the centre. Children’s transitions to school are acknowledged and celebrated. Centre members consider ways to share information so that children’s confidence and capability at playcentre transfers to the new entrant classrooms.</p><p>There is a deliberate commitment to improving internal evaluation. Spontaneous review is used to reflect on aspects of practice. There has been significant development in the understanding of planned review.</p><p>Following professional training key centre members are in the early stages of leading internal evaluation that is improvement focused and informs decision-making. Strategic and annual planning identifies the service’s priorities and associated actions for achieving objectives. Members should continue to implement this learning and use internal evaluation to identify how well their practices improve outcomes for children.</p><p>The association Māori representative of Puriri Whakamaru o Taranaki supports centre members to gain further understandings of te ao Māori. This is developing well as an integral part of the curriculum. Association and centre leaders should use strategic planning and internal evaluation to ensure the good practice occurring is sustained and continues to be built on.</p><p>Centre support persons provide written reports that generally affirm environmental developments and programme practices. These reports should more deliberately focus on outcomes for children and next steps for centre members to improve teaching and learning. This should include a focus on providing centre members with evaluative feedback that assists them to sustain and further enhance the good practice already occurring.</p><p>Appraisal for centre supporters requires strengthening. The process should include: more focused goals that build their capability; and more regular and targeted feedback and feed forward about practices that enhance outcomes for children and their families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The association should continue to support centre members to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen developing assessment and planning practices and evaluation of children’s progress over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improve appraisal for the centre support people to support individual needs and identify professional development to support them in their leadership roles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build centre support staff knowledge and capability to undertake effective internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Awatuna &amp; Districts Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice the association should support centre members to strengthen systems in documenting:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>management for children's excursions. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Awatuna &amp; Districts Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>8 February 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
