</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Montessori Foundation Limited 2 is a privately owned company located in central Hamilton. The centre offers both all day and sessional education and care for children from two years to school age, in a mixed-age setting. At the time of the ERO review there were 22 children from a number of ethnic groups enrolled, including 3 who are identified as Māori.</p><p>Since the ERO report in 2011, the centre has completed licensing requirements with the Ministry of Education for the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>. Upgrades to outdoor areas provide children with further opportunities to garden and have wider experiences of the natural world.</p><p>The licensee continues to be responsible for human resources and financial management. A new centre manager and a student teacher have joined the team.</p><p>Good progress has been made with the areas for development indentified in the 2011 ERO report relating to improving aspects of teaching practice and biculturalism. Teachers have participated as a team in ongoing professional development in self review, assessment and planning and biculturalism in the curriculum. This has resulted in a more visible presence of Māori culture, teachers using te reo Māori more confidently, and further opportunities for children to learn waiata and tikanga Māori practices.</p><p>The centre philosophy is in the process of being reviewed. This review should enable leaders to align strategic planning, expectations for teaching practice and performance management. It should provide a basis for ongoing centre self review and support the development of shared priorities centrewide.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Montessori curriculum is highly evident in this centre. Children participate in a programme that is deliberately designed with logical and increasingly complex steps to promote individualised and child-led learning. They explore a wide range of high-quality and specialist equipment and materials in an attractive and well-designed environment. ERO observed children highly motivated to follow their natural curiosity and learn alongside their friends and teachers. Children develop high levels of competence and capability in literacy, mathematics and language development. Parents for whom English is a new language expressed appreciation for the formal approach to language learning as an important asset for their children.</p><p>Children demonstrate confidence as self-managing learners. They learn practical life skills and investigate the wider world through cultural studies and trips to places of local interest. Children benefit from flexible routines and are able to make choices and sustain their play and learning for extended periods of time, as well as join in teacher-led group times.</p><p>Transitions are carefully planned at the child’s own pace. Parents spoken to during the review shared that their children had been well prepared for further learning at school and managed this transition very successfully.</p><p>The licensee and teachers have developed an innovative approach to documenting children’s learning and development. The individual report books clearly record children’s increasing mastery of key learning steps across all curriculum areas. These reports also include attractive and interesting learning stories, photos and artefacts that are shared with, and valued by, children and their families. Child and parent voice are evident and enrich the assessment process. Children’s learning characteristics and recognition of Māori values and principles such as Whakamana (empowerment) are integrated through the learning stories.</p><p>A useful next step would be to consider ways to make these learning stories readily available to children. This should enable them to see themselves as capable, competent learners and to revisit and share their learning with others. Individual report books would be enhanced by teachers including information about the language, culture and identity of children, and recognising the knowledge and experience they and their families bring to the centre.</p><p>Outdoor areas are attractively presented with appropriate spaces for active, creative and constructive play.</p><p>ERO observed examples of good teaching practice. Teachers have established positive and respectful relationships with one another and with children and families. They hold clear and high expectations for children’s capability and success. Teachers are responsive to children’s interests in play and use this information to extend their learning and development. Children are welcomed into a planned and orderly environment that is aesthetically pleasing. There is a wide variety of specialised equipment for children to choose from and explore. A culture of purpose and calm has been established. Teachers show respect for children as they initiate and lead their own learning.</p><p>ERO’s evaluation has identified that children need further opportunities to:</p><ul>
<li>experience increasing physical challenge as they grow</li>
<li>participate in dramatic and imaginative play</li>
<li>interact with open-ended equipment that encourages imaginative exploration and makes practical use of their knowledge and skills.</li>
</ul><p>The new centre manager has worked effectively to build a collegial team of teachers. She consistently models good practice in a Montessori setting. A feature of her management is the positive and inclusive relationships she has established with whānau and families from diverse cultures. Parents expressed high levels of confidence and trust in her leadership. They appreciate the many opportunities created for them to be partners in the learning and care of their children. The centre manager demonstrates effective leadership in implementing bicultural practices that build success for Māori as Māori, and builds children’s understanding about New Zealand as a bicultural society. In addition, she leads professional development opportunities to build the knowledge of teachers about the Montessori curriculum.</p><p>The licensee continues to work in a positive and professional relationship with the centre manager and teachers. She maintains a focus on providing a Montessori-based service for children and their families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The licensee and centre manager have identified, and ERO agrees, that there is a need to align the centre philosophy and the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations</em> 2008 with:</p><ul>
<li>governance and strategic planning</li>
<li>expectations for teaching practice and performance management</li>
<li>self review of all centre operations.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation </h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that centre leaders and teachers continue to seek external professional development related to:</p><ul>
<li>developing and implementing self-review processes that enable the service to sustain centre development and improvement</li>
<li>ensuring all teachers consistently demonstrate current best teaching practice and content knowledge of mathematics learning in the Montessori early childhood setting.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Montessori Foundation Limited 2 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Montessori Foundation Limited 2 will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>24 November 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
