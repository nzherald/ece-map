<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>First Years Preschool is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>First Years Preschool is a community-based centre in Dannevirke. It provides care and education for 53 children up to five years of age and operates Monday to Friday from 7.45am to 5.30pm.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO review, the acting manager and the head teacher in the over two year old section have been permanently appointed. The centre is committed to employing qualified staff, and almost all of its teachers are qualified.</p><p>Significant refurbishments, including extensions to the infant and toddler space, renovations to the kitchen and bathroom in the over two area, and the development of a meeting space for staff, have occurred.</p><p>A parent committee is responsible for the governance of the preschool. The committee provides good support for teacher training and regular professional development opportunities.</p><p>Many areas of good performance identified in the 2010 ERO review continue to be strengths and features of the centre.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from positive, warm and caring relationships with teachers. They enjoy the company of others and many are involved in play for extended periods of time. Children show a good sense of belonging. Teachers know children well and affirm their efforts. Parents are comfortable to spend time in the centre.</p><p>Teachers encourage children&rsquo;s independence. Children have many opportunities to make choices, follow their interests, and revisit prior learning. Teachers make good use of natural materials in the well-resourced outdoor area to add to children&rsquo;s play.</p><p>Literacy, numeracy and science are features of the programme. Teachers successfully model and support children&rsquo;s language development. They are responsive and work in unhurried ways to meet infants&rsquo; and toddlers&rsquo; needs. Teachers effectively encourage children&rsquo;s social skills.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s interests and learning are recorded in well-presented, attractive profile books. Their work is highly valued and pleasantly displayed. Many parents actively contribute to their child&rsquo;s assessment. Teachers have identified that they need to continue to find ways of further involving families and wh&#257;nau in children&rsquo;s assessment.</p><p>Staff are committed to giving significance to M&#257;ori learners&rsquo; culture, language and identity. Two teachers effectively support staff to grow and develop their confidence and understanding of te ao M&#257;ori. Relationships with mana whenua are developing.</p><p>Transitions across the centre are flexible and responsive to meet the needs of individual children and families. Teachers have established relationships with local schools which support children and families with transition to school.</p><p>The centre manager is an effective leader. There are many positive opportunities for teachers to develop and extend their leadership and use their skills in the centre and wider early childhood education community. Teachers communicate effectively and work collaboratively with children and each other.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers focus on improving the quality of education and care. They have agreed that their key next steps to improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to build their understanding of self review to guide improvement</li>
<li>further develop aspects of children&rsquo;s assessment and planning processes to clearly show the impact of teachers&rsquo; practice on children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>extend appraisal developments to make further use of the <em>M&#257;ori Education Strategy &ndash; Ka Hikitia</em> and <em>T&#257;taiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of M&#257;ori Learners</em>.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of First Years Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h4>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h4><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>15 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
