</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Red Beach Early Learning Centre is a well established, privately owned education and care service for up to 20 children over two years of age. It offers all day and half day sessions in a purpose built facility in a quiet residential area in Whangaparoa, north of Auckland. Outdoor sessions make use of the local natural environment and community.</p><p>Since ERO's 2013 review the owner has delegated more responsibility for daily operations to the head teacher. The stable teaching team consists of long serving qualified teachers. Making the bicultural programme more visible, and revising the centre philosophy have been the focus of centre development.</p><p>ERO's 2013 review identified the centre's commitment to respectful teaching practices that promote child-led learning. These practices have been sustained.</p><p>This report highlights the need to embed new management systems and strengthen internal evaluation so that research continues to inform the provision of the programme.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children make good use of the whole learning environment to explore and initiate their own activities. They play well together, show respect when interacting with adults and each other and solve problems as they participate in imaginative and sustained play. They enjoy revisiting and sharing their learning experiences with others. In some group play contexts, children extend their learning through collaborative interactions.</p><p>Children access a wide range of natural resources, and enjoy outdoor sessions that use the large reserve next door to the centre and other local community venues. Activities are well resourced and children are offered many opportunities that encourage exploration and creativity.</p><p>The environment reflects the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa, New Zealand. A team focus to imbed and integrate te reo Maōri into the programme reflects teachers' commitment to strengthening the centre's bicultural programme. Wall displays share useful information about children's interests and learning in a print-rich environment.</p><p>The centre owner and staff share a commitment to the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and to the philosophy of learning through play. Teachers model a calm and gentle tone when interacting with children. They work well as a team to respond to children’s play. Teachers know children’s individual interests and preferences and ask open-ended questions to invite children's contributions to discussions. They provide clear instructions and model the use of appropriate language.</p><p>The service’s internal evaluation documentation shows that parents share their aspirations for their children’s learning. A recent survey shows that parents are highly satisfied with the variety of activities in the learning programme, the welcoming and child friendly environment and the quality of teaching. They also value how teachers readily communicate about their children and the learning and care provided.</p><p>Teachers are continuing to seek ways to strengthen learning partnerships with local schools. They should consider the appropriateness of their formal testing of older children’s learning and review their programme in the light of their philosophy and <em>Te Whariki.</em></p><p>The owner is experienced and shares leadership with the teaching team. Teachers' performance appraisal shows their ongoing reflection about their professional practice.</p><p>Evaluation is very well embedded in centre practices. Teacher reflections are linked to outcomes for children and improvements align with the centre's strategic direction. Teachers’ individual contributions are valued and are supported by targeted professional development and mentoring. Decision making is collaborative and teachers have regular professional discussions with others in local centres.</p><p>Teacher inquiry into aspects of their practice has been a recent key focus of their professional development. Leaders should ensure that this inquiry and evaluation are underpinned by a shared understanding of current research about early childhood education.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that priorities for improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring that assessment of children's learning reflects <em>Te Whāriki</em> and indicators of best practice in Early Childhood Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>working with parents to share information about current theory and best practice in early childhood education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation so that research and evidence inform improvement and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to promote increased leadership and management responsibilities for staff.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Red Beach Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice, the owner should ensure that regulatory checks on sleeping children are documented.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Red Beach Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>27 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review<a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"></a></h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
