</table><p>Abacus Montessori is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Abacus Montessori provides education and care for 51 children, including up to 16 under the age of two years. It operates a full-day programme in three age-based rooms.</p><p>The centre is privately owned. The joint owners provide governance for the centre. The leadership team consists of an assistant manager, two team leaders and a curriculum leader. They provide professional leadership and guidance. One of the owners and most of the teachers are Montessori trained. The teaching staff are qualified and registered early childhood teachers or training to become qualified.</p><p>There is a clear, shared vision for learning underpinned by Montessori and Te Whāriki philosophies that promote independence and social competence.</p><p>The owners and teachers have made good progress in addressing areas identified for improvement in the 2015 ERO review. This has included the internal evaluation process, strengthening assessment and planning, and the development of further understandings of te ao Māori.</p><p>The teachers are involved in the Aranui Community Trust Incorporated Society learning cluster with local early childhood centres and schools.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy is focused on nurturing children's independence and is very evident in the programme. Children have a strong sense of belonging where their play is valued as meaningful learning. There are positive and respectful relationships among teachers, children and parents.</p><p>The centre's environment plays a significant role in supporting children's learning. Teachers innovatively adapt spaces to foster children's creativity, investigation and problem solving skills. They show respect for children as capable, self-directed learners.</p><p>Teachers are highly skilled at responding to children's ideas and know when to extend children's learning and when to allow them to lead their own learning. The value and respect for biculturalism is evident in the way reo Māori, tikanga and te ao Māori concepts are integrated and celebrated in centre practices. Children enjoy regular excursions into the community and visits to the centre by community members.</p><p>Planning is focused on individual children, and teachers frequently discuss strategies for extending children's learning. Records of learning show very good analysis of the learning and identify possibilities for further learning.</p><p>Parents are encouraged to be partners in their children's learning. Teachers provide many opportunities for families to participate in the programme, contribute to the curriculum and learn about their children's progress. Children's priorities for learning are shared with parents and children through wall displays.</p><p>Children in the nursery experience nurturing and caring interactions with their primary caregiver. Infants and toddlers experience close connections with a small number of adults. Routines respond to each child's needs and rhythms, and teachers communicate well with parents to ensure they are meeting the family's and child's needs. Good use is made of the nursery environment to provide children with rich and stimulating learning experiences. Transitions into and within the centre are well planned.</p><p>Leadership is highly collaborative and focused on building teacher capability. Leaders have high expectations for teaching and learning that promotes equitable outcomes for all children. They clearly articulate the centre's vision and philosophy. Teachers are encouraged and supported to further develop their teaching capabilities through professional learning and development and ongoing coaching and mentoring. The reflective and professional teaching team continually improve teaching practices and learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre has very good management systems and processes. Governance policies and procedures are regularly reviewed. Strategic planning is well developed and cohesive and focused on the long-term vision and goals for strategic planning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders and ERO agree that leaders need to continue to refine existing sound practice through:</p><ul>
<li>increasing knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation across the teaching team</li>
<li>further developing leadership capability.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Abacus Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Abacus Montessori Preschool will be in four years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>29 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <i><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"></a></i><a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
