</table><p>Kindercare Learning Centres Belmont is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres Belmont has been providing education and care for children and families in the community for over 40 years. It is owned and operated by Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd (the organisation). Many teachers and families have had connections with the centre for a number of years. The centre offers sessional and full day care and education options for children from infants to school age. Teachers and families represent a diverse range of cultures and ethnic groups.</p><p>The centre is divided into three rooms to cater for the different age groups, with access to shared outdoor spaces. The organisation provides policies, procedures and a framework and process to monitor health and safety. The centre has a long-standing leadership and teaching team, with low staff turnover. Most staff are qualified and registered teachers.</p><p>The service philosophy is based on the organisation's three key values for children to be ‘safe, loved and learning’. An area manager works in partnership with the centre director to support centre operations. The organisation has developed service-wide expectations and a strategic approach to te ao Māori and culturally responsive practices.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have maintained the positive aspects identified in the March 2015 ERO report. They have worked together to continue to promote a collaborative learning culture, enhance teachers' knowledge and effective teaching and learning practices, and use self review to evaluate and enhance the impact and effectiveness of initiatives, practices and management.</p><p>This evaluation was one of five reviews in Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd, Auckland region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders and teachers actively foster respectful relationships with children, parents and whānau within an inclusive and calm learning environment. They model high levels of respect and care for one another and for children and families. The home language, culture and identity of families are acknowledged and highly valued, which promotes a positive sense of belonging (whanaungatanga). Children’s learning and wellbeing are at the heart of all decision making.</p><p>Teachers give strong emphasis to building ongoing learning partnerships with children. Parents are regularly informed about children’s learning through well-written records. Informative wall displays make children's learning highly visible and provide opportunities for children and parents to revisit learning together.</p><p>Teachers are very responsive to the interests, strengths and capabilities of children within a child-led curriculum. They highly value children's ideas, involve them in decision making, offer choices and encourage independence. Teachers carefully consider the presentation of the environment and quality resourcing to encourage children’s curiosity and exploration. Physical challenges, creativity, literacy, numeracy and science are well integrated into the daily programme in ways that are meaningful for children. Excursions into the community and purposeful links to local schools enrich curriculum provision.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well supported to succeed. Teachers work collaboratively with families. They make purposeful connections to internal and external expertise to support families and diverse learners.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from a curriculum of care and respect. Teachers are mindful of supporting a positive sense of wellbeing and security for children. They work closely with parents and whānau to provide respectful routines and rituals that are aligned to home rhythms.</p><p>Strong, effective leadership has established a reflective culture of committed staff focused on ongoing improvement and positive outcomes for children. Leaders have high expectations for teaching and learning outcomes for children. They provide purposeful professional support, including targeted professional development and mentoring, to strengthen teacher capability and leadership capacity.</p><p>Leaders and teachers work collaboratively and take collective responsibility for children’s learning and wellbeing. The organisation has established a strategic approach that is well aligned to service priorities and the professional learning and development of teachers. Governance and management practices are underpinned by a strong, shared vision and purpose. There is a clear focus on building leadership and promoting robust appraisal and mentoring processes to promote ongoing improvement and positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At the service level, the priorities are to further:</p><ul>
<li>develop annual action planning of service priorities that enable regular monitoring, evaluation and reporting of progress on priorities that are focused on learner outcomes</li>
<li>strengthen understandings and use of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> including the development of local curriculum and priorities</li>
<li>extend understandings of te ao Māori and culturally responsive practices.</li>
</ul><p>At the organisation level, the priorities are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>give greater prominence to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi in key documentation and teaching practices, including fully implementing the organisation's te ao Māori and culturally responsive practice action planning across the service</li>
<li>refine strategic planning and ensure clear alignment of internal evaluation, monitoring and reporting</li>
<li>evaluate the effectiveness of leadership, management and governance.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres Belmont completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Southern)</p><p><span>Southern Region - Te Tai Tini</span></p><p>13 March 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
