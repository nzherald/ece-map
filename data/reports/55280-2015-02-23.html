</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Chipmunks Childcare Centre is located in the suburb of Tamatea, Napier. It is licensed to provide allday education and care for 25 children, including 10 up to two years old. The centre is governed and managed by the two owners and a wh&#257;nau representative.</p><p>The guiding philosophy is based on building strong and respectful relationships with children and their wh&#257;nau to promote a sense of belonging and ownership. These aspects were highly evident during ERO&rsquo;s evaluation.</p><p>Management and teachers have responded positively to the areas for development in the May 2013 ERO report. The Ministry of Education provided targeted professional learning and development in assessment, planning and evaluation, appraisal processes and provisionally registered teachers&rsquo; (PRT) support and guidance programme. This has led to positive developments in teaching and learning practices. The centre was relicensed under the <em>2008 Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations</em> in October 2014.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children, their parents and wh&#257;nau are warmly welcomed on arrival. Teachers engage parents and wh&#257;nau through a range of formal and informal communication strategies, and value their aspirations for their children, feedback and ideas. Responsive and respectful relationships are formed with each family, supporting children&rsquo;s sense of belonging. Teachers know children and their wh&#257;nau well.</p><p>Children experience a curriculum responsive to their individual and group interests and based on<em>Te</em> <em>Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Their ideas and thinking are extended through conversations, resources and activities. Children show confidence and high levels of independence. Literacy, mathematics and cultural learning experiences are woven throughout the daily programme. In response to a recent review, teachers are continuing to strengthen children&rsquo;s choice of, and access to, resources.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are nurtured and encouraged to explore. Teachers respond meaningfully to their interests and needs. Care routines promote a sense of security through good information sharing between families and staff.</p><p>Teaching and learning practices affirm M&#257;ori children&rsquo;s language, culture and identity. The use of te&nbsp;reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori is reflected in the centre curriculum. Tuakana teina practices are evident. Support for cultural diversity and inclusive practices are highly evident. Staff enrich children&rsquo;s cultural experiences through organised activities, in and out of the centre.</p><p>Profile books provide parents and wh&#257;nau with a detailed record of their child&rsquo;s individual and group learning experiences. Teachers have developed useful expectations to guide assessment practices. Regular sharing and reflection supports increased consistency in extending children&rsquo;s learning over time.</p><p>There is a considered approach to supporting children&rsquo;s transition to school. The centre has established relationships with local schools, supported by their involvement in &lsquo;Team Tamatea&rsquo;. Children participate in school activities throughout the year, including the annual Tamatea kapa haka performance.</p><p>Useful systems and processes to guide teacher appraisal and to support PRTs have been recently developed. Ongoing feedback affirms staff strengths and identifies next steps to continue to grow teacher practice.</p><p>The management team has developed a useful strategic plan to inform centre operation. Plans are in place to continue to strengthen governance roles and responsibilities.</p><p>Self review continues to develop. There is a greater understanding of how review informs and guides centre development. A useful process supports teachers to reflect on what they do and to make positive changes. A next step for staff is to evaluate the effectiveness of the changes in improving outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management, staff and ERO agree to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>support and build leadership capacity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen and embed inquiry and review processes to inform future priorities and continue to improve outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Chipmunks Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h3>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h3><p>The next ERO review of Chipmunks Childcare Centre will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie,</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central,</p><p>23 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
