<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p>Te Atatu Peninsula Kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association. The Association provides a comprehensive range of management systems and professional development to support kindergarten operations. A professional support manager provides advice and guidance to the teaching staff. Up to 30 children between three and five years of age are catered for in sessional programmes.</p>
<p>The kindergarten is a well established part of a close-knit community. Many families have links with each other outside the kindergarten. Some parents attended the centre themselves when they were young children.</p>
<p>Teachers are committed to developing a bicultural approach to learning based on the Treaty of Waitangi. As a result, they are strengthening the programme to reflect te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>Children are capable and competent learners. They engage fully in the programme and make good use of the well resourced learning environment. Their interactions with other children and with teachers are respectful and friendly. They view themselves as capable and confident problem-solvers. Their growing ability to negotiate and discuss their play with their peers helps them to settle conflict peacefully.</p>
<p>Wh&#257;nau/families are developing a strong sense of belonging in the centre, which reflects a culturally diverse community. Wh&#257;nau are becoming more involved in supporting and working with teachers and children. They help children with project work and share their expertise and cultural knowledge with them. Teachers value parent input.</p>
<p>Teachers initiate rich interactions with children. They provide good quality programmes with a strong focus on project work. Projects provide opportunities for children to develop in-depth knowledge based on their interests. Currently, teachers are working on ways to develop programmes that encourage children take a more active role in setting goals for their own learning.</p>
<p>Teachers have identified their next steps for development as improving self-review practices, making planning clear to parents, and focusing more on developing programmes that improve the individual child&rsquo;s learning. ERO agrees with these next steps.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Te Atatu Peninsula Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atTe Atatu Peninsula Kindergarten.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The teaching team has changed since the 2008 ERO report. A former teacher from the kindergarten is now the head teacher. This is her first experience in this leadership role. An experienced teacher has since joined the team. These changes have been well managed. Teachers work effectively together and are supportive of one another. Children continue to enjoy good quality learning.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>Capable and confident learners. Children are capable and competent learners. They engage fully in the programme and frequently develop their ideas in discussions with friends and teachers. They are imaginative and persistent in their play. They sometimes revisit recent learning experiences. Opportunities for children to show leadership at mat times are helping to develop their self-esteem and confidence.</p>
<p>Good quality teacher interactions. Teachers initiate high quality interactions with children. They remind children about previous learning and offer prompts as reminders in discussions. Teachers model constructive learning interactions. They seek children&rsquo;s opinions about setting up learning environments. These opportunities to make decisions together promote children&rsquo;s ability to reason and to predict possible outcomes in their play.</p>
<p>Literacy. Children know the purpose of reading and writing as a way to access information and record their ideas. They frequently &lsquo;read&rsquo; their portfolios. They listen attentively to stories and enjoy telling stories to their peers and teachers about their art work. An understanding of the sounds of letters has enabled some children to recognise and spell words. Teachers recognise that children become capable readers and writers when they are provided with a broad range of literacy experiences.</p>
<p>Numeracy. Many opportunities are provided for children to explore numeracy concepts within the context of their play. As a result, children know how to measure, count, and do basic subtraction.</p>
<p>Science. Children are well supported to explore in-depth science topics. The creation of a garden area has provided opportunities for children to learn how to plan the layout of gardens purposefully and how to grow plants and vegetables. A recent interest in planets has led to a study of the lunar system. Beach studies have resulted in children engaging in rich discussions about sea life. Children test their own theories about nature during these times.</p>
<p>Good quality learning environment. The learning environment is used effectively by children and teachers to enrich children&rsquo;s learning experiences. Children actively make changes to the environment to improve their play. They play in all curriculum areas provided. Learning equipment is plentiful. Teachers add resources to stimulate particular interests. Children&rsquo;s art work is valued and is attractively displayed throughout the centre.</p>
<p>Bicultural heritage. Children are provided with many opportunities to experience the richness of the M&#257;ori culture. Teachers have a high focus on acknowledging and showing respect for the Treaty of Waitangi in an early childhood context. They help children to understand aspects of te ao M&#257;ori, the M&#257;ori world. Good use is made of simple te reo M&#257;ori. The use of tikanga M&#257;ori, such as mihi mihi and poroporaki (welcoming and farewelling), is a recently established part of the programme. Matariki is celebrated as an annual event. M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau are sharing their knowledge and skills with children and teachers.</p>
<p>Wh&#257;nau involvement. Teachers are working at developing a stronger sense of belonging by improving wh&#257;nau and teacher relationships. Parents are beginning to share their talents and aspects of their rich cultural backgrounds to support the programme. Parents help during sessions and work alongside children to support project work.</p>
<p>Diversity supported. Teachers support children from diverse cultural backgrounds to smooth their transition into the kindergarten. They support children&rsquo;s sense of belonging and well-being. Words from children&rsquo;s home languages are used to help children feel at home in the kindergarten.</p>
<p>Planning, evaluation and assessment. Teachers have developed good planning systems. Recent developments have focused on the individual child as a learner. Individual learning is starting to be identified in group learning experiences. A new process has been implemented for children to think about how they can extend their own learning. Teachers are beginning to give children feedback on their strengths and abilities. Children are starting to set their own goals.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p>Extending children&rsquo;s learning opportunities. Teachers could focus on continuing to develop the quality of children&rsquo;s learning by:</p>
<ul><li>providing children with more frequent leadership opportunities</li>
<li>identifying children&rsquo;s learning more consistently in individual and group learning stories</li>
<li>developing children&rsquo;s ability to plan for their own learning</li>
<li>using displays better to help parents to understand how teachers plan to support children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><p>Self review. Teachers have identified that self review is an area that they would like to focus on for development. Teachers could use Ng&#257; Arohaehae Whai Hua, the Ministry of Education self-review guidelines for early childhood centres, to refine their self-review processes. Professional development could help teachers to use Association formats for more effective strategic and operational planning.</p>
<a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3>
<p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul><li>transitions ensure the continuing wellbeing, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3>
<p>Although no children with moderate to high special needs are currently enrolled in this centre, teachers have provided well for children with special needs in the past.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p>Trusting and respectful relationships with parents. Teachers take time to talk with parents of children with special needs as each child begins to attend the kindergarten. Teachers take a respectful approach to supporting families.</p>
<p>Adaptation. Recently teachers learnt makaton, a multi-modal language programme for teaching children communication, language and literacy skills. The kindergarten learning environment meets the needs of children with special learning challenges. The layout of the environment and range of equipment is sufficiently developed to cater for children with special needs.</p>
<h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p>Strengthening individualised planning and assessment processes could help teachers to provide more targeted programmes for children with special needs.</p>

<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-te-atatu-peninsula-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Te Atatu Peninsula Kindergarten</h2>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Te Atatu Peninsula Kindergarten.</p>
<p>Te Atatu Peninsula Kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association. The Association provides a comprehensive range of management systems and professional development to support kindergarten operations. A professional support manager provides advice and guidance to the teaching staff. Up to 30 children between three and five years of age are catered for in sessional programmes.</p>
<p>The kindergarten is a well established part of a close-knit community. Many families have links with each other outside the kindergarten. Some parents attended the centre themselves when they were young children.</p>
<p>Teachers are committed to developing a bicultural approach to learning based on the Treaty of Waitangi. As a result, they are strengthening the programme to reflect te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>Children are capable and competent learners. They engage fully in the programme and make good use of the well resourced learning environment. Their interactions with other children and with teachers are respectful and friendly. They view themselves as capable and confident problem-solvers. Their growing ability to negotiate and discuss their play with their peers helps them to settle conflict peacefully.</p>
<p>Wh&#257;nau/families are developing a strong sense of belonging in the centre, which reflects a culturally diverse community. Wh&#257;nau are becoming more involved in supporting and working with teachers and children. They help children with project work and share their expertise and cultural knowledge with them. Teachers value parent input.</p>
<p>Teachers initiate rich interactions with children. They provide good quality programmes with a strong focus on project work. Projects provide opportunities for children to develop in-depth knowledge based on their interests. Currently, teachers are working on ways to develop programmes that encourage children take a more active role in setting goals for their own learning.</p>
<p>Teachers have identified their next steps for development as improving self-review practices, making planning clear to parents, and focusing more on developing programmes that improve the individual child&rsquo;s learning. ERO agrees with these next steps.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>
