<html><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Topkids Virginia Avenue early childhood centre is located in Auckland central. The centre serves a diverse multicultural community where English is an additional language for many children and families. Topkids is part of the Kidicorp organisation that provides management systems and leadership support to the centre. Itwas initially established as five centres with individual licenses. These licences have very recently been merged by the Ministry of Education, and the centre now operates under one licence that caters for up to 136 children, including 40 children under the age of two years.</p><p align="left">Children experience good quality education and care programmes. Since the previous 2009 and 2011 ERO reviews, teachers have made significant progress in the ways they identify and respond to children&rsquo;s interests. The leadership team have guided the review of routines to ensure that they meet the needs of individual children. As a result children are supported to engage in, and extend upon, learning of interest to them for sustained periods of time.</p><p align="left">Interactions between teachers and children are positive and affirming. Most teachers encourage children&rsquo;s learning through skilful teaching conversations. Staff frequently praise children&rsquo;s progress and learning. Children develop friendships and learn useful social skills that enable them to play harmoniously with others.</p><p align="left">Children access a good range of resources. Teachers carefully design the indoor and outside play spaces so they invite children&rsquo;s exploration and investigation. Children participate in a range of literacy and numeracy experiences that are meaningful to them. There are plentiful opportunities for children to write their own names, read stories with teachers, and develop their language skills.</p><p align="left">Parents report high levels of satisfaction with the education and care their children receive. They appreciate teachers&rsquo; regular communication with them and newly developed systems that enable them to communicate more with staff about their children&rsquo;s learning. Children benefit from strengthening partnerships between home and the centre.</p><p align="left">The leadership team have identified a number of areas for ongoing development and review. These include building more consistent teaching practices that extend children&rsquo;s learning and increasingly acknowledge New Zealand&rsquo;s bi-cultural heritage.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Topkids Virginia Avenue was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atTopkids Virginia Avenue.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The centre&rsquo;s previous ERO reports in 2009 and 2011 recommended that teachers develop planning and assessment approaches that focus on the strengths and interests of individual groups of children. Staff have made significant progress in planning for children&rsquo;s interests and progress. A new centre manager has also been appointed since the previous review.</p><p align="left">Programmes are provided in five separate rooms with children grouped according to their age. Eighteen permanent staff members are employed across the centre. Many are qualified teachers or are currently enrolled in teacher education courses.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Confident learners. Teachers plan programmes that value children as leaders of their own learning. Children actively explore areas of interest to them for extended periods of time. Flexible routines allow children&rsquo;s individual needs to be followed. Teachers support children to make decisions about their participation in group activities. Children are confident communicators and are supported to develop social skills that promote friendships and encourage cooperative play.</p><p align="left">Teaching interactions. Most teachers extend children&rsquo;s interests with questions and interactions that facilitate their thinking and ongoing learning. Children often learn alongside teachers in small group experiences that enhance their language development, literacy and numeracy skills. Infants and toddlers enjoy caring relationships with adults. Teachers frequently acknowledge children&rsquo;s efforts and praise children&rsquo;s positive play.</p><p align="left">Partnership approach. Teachers warmly welcome families to the centre and regularly share information with parents about their children&rsquo;s learning and progress. Parents appreciate the friendly relationships they have with staff. Families receive good information about centre operations. Teachers actively seek parents&rsquo; aspirations and goals for their children. Children benefit from adults increasing collaboration and information sharing.</p><p align="left">Learning environment. Children&rsquo;s learning is enhanced through well organised play spaces. They explore a good variety of resources and most learning areas are well presented to invite children&rsquo;s investigation and learning. Teachers design play spaces so children can readily access equipment of interest to them. A range of outdoor climbing equipment supports physical development skills. Teachers work together to ensure children are well supervised.</p><p align="left">Documenting children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers record children&rsquo;s engagement in a wide range of experiences. Teachers value parent&rsquo;s contributions and use a range of strategies to encourage their sharing. In most rooms teachers present children&rsquo;s learning in attractive wall displays, enabling children to revisit past learning and to share and celebrate their success with others.</p><p align="left">Management practices. The centre leadership team are well supported by Kidicorp management. Useful systems have been established to guide review and promote continuous improvement of centre practices. Teachers appreciate ready access to courses and workshops of interest to them. Regular staff, head teacher and management meetings provide a forum for critical reflection and sharing good models of practice between rooms. Outcomes for children are monitored through well developed management review processes.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">The leadership team have prioritised key areas for ongoing development. These include:</p><p align="left">continuing to work with teaching teams to enhance assessment practices, including planning for teaching and learning so that children&rsquo;s emerging interests and progress is increasingly visible</p><ul>
<li>building staff capability and confidence in using self review</li>
<li>increasing teachers knowledge of tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori so that New Zealand&rsquo;s bi-cultural heritage is acknowledged and celebrated</li>
<li>encouraging parents to increasingly share their goals and aspirations for their children.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In addition, managers and teachers could:</p><ul>
<li>consider how to more consistently support and extend children&rsquo;s interests and learning</li>
<li>review and improve indoor and outdoor learning areas so that each room reflects children&rsquo;s current interests</li>
<li>monitor the number of children transitioning into and within the centre so that teachers are able to maintain quality learning programmes for children</li>
</ul><p align="left">Children should benefit from long-term plans that focus on enhancing learning programmes and outcomes for children.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Topkids Virginia Avenue completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake</li>
</ul><p align="left">In order to improve current practices the licensee and manager should implement plans to improve the outdoor learning environment so that uneven surfacing can be further minimised. This has been an ongoing issue for the centre.</p><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2><p align="left">ERO and centre managers agree that centre staff should continue to use effective self-review processes to improve the quality of teaching interactions, assessment and bi-cultural practices to further enhance outcomes for children.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p><p align="left">30 March 2012</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table style="width: 568px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>

The centre serves a diverse multicultural community where English is an additional language for many children and families. Topkids is part of the Kidicorp organisation that provides management systems and leadership support to the centre. Itwas initially established as five centres with individual licenses. These licences have very recently been merged by the Ministry of Education, and the centre now operates under one licence that caters for up to 136 children, including 40 children under the age of two years.</p><p align="left">Children experience good quality education and care programmes. Since the previous 2009 and 2011 ERO reviews, teachers have made significant progress in the ways they identify and respond to children&rsquo;s interests. The leadership team have guided the review of routines to ensure that they meet the needs of individual children. As a result children are supported to engage in, and extend upon, learning of interest to them for sustained periods of time.</p><p align="left">Interactions between teachers and children are positive and affirming. Most teachers encourage children&rsquo;s learning through skilful teaching conversations. Staff frequently praise children&rsquo;s progress and learning. Children develop friendships and learn useful social skills that enable them to play harmoniously with others.</p><p align="left">Children access a good range of resources. Teachers carefully design the indoor and outside play spaces so they invite children&rsquo;s exploration and investigation. Children participate in a range of literacy and numeracy experiences that are meaningful to them. There are plentiful opportunities for children to write their own names, read stories with teachers, and develop their language skills.</p><p align="left">Parents report high levels of satisfaction with the education and care their children receive. They appreciate teachers&rsquo; regular communication with them and newly developed systems that enable them to communicate more with staff about their children&rsquo;s learning. Children benefit from strengthening partnerships between home and the centre.</p><p align="left">The leadership team have identified a number of areas for ongoing development and review. These include building more consistent teaching practices that extend children&rsquo;s learning and increasingly acknowledge New Zealand&rsquo;s bi-cultural heritage.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
