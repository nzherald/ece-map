<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Waimauku Childcare Centre is developing its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children. Centre managers are using self review to help improve management processes and communication with families. Staff are continuing to develop their understanding and use of self review.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Waimauku Childcare Centre is located in a semi-rural area, close to the communities of Waimauku and Muriwai. The centre caters for families with children from three months to school age. The service offers all day and sessional care.</p><p>In July 2012, a new owner purchased the centre. She is experienced in centre management and has used the 2010 ERO report to assess the centre&rsquo;s strengths and to consider its future strategic direction. Working with teachers, she has made a number of improvements in the management practices and physical environment of the centre and plans to further develop the programme and the facilities.</p><p>New teaching teams have been established. Head teachers are well supported and are benefiting from recent professional development. Whole-centre professional development is planned for 2013 to help align teaching practice with the recently reviewed centre philosophy.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children display a strong sense of belonging and settle quickly in the centre. They enjoy positive relationships with each other and with teachers. They display good social skills and are inclusive of each other in their play. Families are welcome in the centre and are encouraged to participate in the programme.</p><p>Children benefit from having approachable teachers who know and care for them well. Younger children form close attachments to their teachers and enjoy the calm atmosphere and spacious environment of the centre. Teachers communicate well with children and support the development of their oral language skills. They listen and respond to children&rsquo;s cues and are respectful in their care practices. Older children enjoy opportunities to play alongside teachers and make decisions about their learning activities.</p><p>For most of the day, the programme is child led. Flexible routines for younger children support them to develop independence and confidence. Group learning opportunities are well planned and offer children choices.</p><p>To enhance the curriculum for older children, centre managers and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>integrate appropriate literacy and mathematical learning within the context of play</li>
<li>link programme planning more closely to children&rsquo;s individual interests</li>
<li>improve the consistency and quality of their assessment and evaluation of children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>review areas of play and promote opportunities for children to extend their learning in each area.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers communicate well with each other in their teaching teams. To continue to develop the effectiveness of their teaching practices, teachers could share useful ideas and implement effective practices consistently across the centre.</p><p>Good progress has been made in re-establishing connections with the local community and increasing communication with families. Consultation with teachers and families is meaningful and the information gained is used to improve the service. Partnerships with wh&#257;nau are developing and the service is using external support to increase teachers&rsquo; responsiveness to parents&rsquo; aspirations and their ability to respond to the culture, language and identity of M&#257;ori children. Teachers could now use <em>T&#257;taiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of M&#257;ori Learners</em> to review and improve their current practice in relation to M&#257;ori children and their families.</p><p>Centre managers are improving teaching practice. Good management systems guide decision making. The owner is working towards a new performance management approach that will make closer links between teacher goals, the registered teacher criteria and the strategic direction of the centre. By developing a strategic plan with measurable indicators, timeframes and key shared responsibilities, leaders will be able to review progress over time to help ensure improved outcomes for children.</p><p>Centre managers use self review well and make good use of Ministry of Education self-review tools. The new owner&rsquo;s review of all centre operations has been helpful in identifying further areas for improvement.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that teachers would benefit from professional development on planning, assessment and evaluation practices that extend children&rsquo;s learning.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waimauku Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the owner should:</p><ul>
<li>regularly review the supervision plan for the outdoor areas</li>
<li>secure furniture or equipment that could topple and cause injury or damage</li>
<li>minimise or eliminate tripping hazards, especially in the outdoor areas.</li>
