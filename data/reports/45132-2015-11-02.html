</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edukids Delamain operates under the BestStart Educare Ltd management structure. BestStart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large national organisation that owns early childhood centres across New Zealand.</p><p>The centre provides education and care for children up to school age. It is licensed for 100 children, including up to 25 children, aged up to two years old. An increasing number of the staff, children and families are from diverse cultures and backgrounds.</p><p>The centre is purpose built and set up as four rooms; a nursery, toddler room, preschool and a prep-room for the oldest children. It is appropriately resourced and well maintained.</p><p>A centre manager oversees the day-to-day operation of the centre. She is supported in her role by regular visits from a business manager and a professional service manager from the BestStart organisation.</p><p>There have been many changes in staff since the 2012 ERO review. Most staff are trained early childhood teachers. Those who are beginning teachers are being well supported to work towards full teacher registration.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The new teaching team has recently reviewed the centre philosophy. Teachers have successfully developed a more shared philosophy to reflect and guide how they work with children.</p><p>Teachers are respectful of children. They interact with them in caring and positive ways. They listen to children’s preferences and respond appropriately. Teachers interact with infants and toddlers in sensitive and nurturing ways. Children’s oral language development is well supported.</p><p>Teachers' value and support children’s home languages. Some teachers speak and use other languages when interacting with children.</p><p>Teachers value and promote effective relationships. They actively encourage children’s social skills and support them to play successfully with others.</p><p>Children have good opportunities to learn about their community with regular visitors to the centre, and excursions into the local community. Teachers have established useful links with local schools to support children as they move on to school.</p><p>Children benefit from a programme that is based on what teachers notice about children’s interests and how they extend these. Teachers make good use of Te Whāriki (the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum) as part of their planning process. They are more purposefully seeking parents’ aspirations and making increasing use of parents' ideas to inform their programme planning.</p><p>Teachers' individual strengths and interests are well used in the programme and for aspects of leadership. This is particularly evident, in some rooms, for supporting the learning of Pacific children, children who have English as a second language, and understanding of Māori perspectives.</p><p>Teachers work well as a team and share information regularly to ensure children’s needs are well met. Teachers work effectively with other agencies to support children and their families who may need additional support.</p><p>Teachers are becoming more reflective. They are now using an increasing range of evaluative tools and indicators to assess their own practice and to help them focus more on improved learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The business manager and professional service manager provide useful support and leadership to guide centre improvement and development. Teachers are provided with regular and useful professional learning and development. There is a clear system guiding the appraisal of teachers.</p><p>BestStart has many systems to help centres improve learning outcomes for children. These include:</p><ul>
<li>a review process to identify what is going well, and next steps for centre improvement</li>
<li>support from centre managers in the day-to-day operation of centres from regular visits of education and business managers</li>
<li>effective systems and processes for ensuring children have safe and healthy learning environments.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre managers have identified, and ERO agrees, that key next steps to improve outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening self review, including following a clearer process and focusing more on evaluating the quality of teaching</li>
<li>improving the ways teachers evaluate programme planning and the effectiveness of their teaching strategies</li>
<li>increasing the visibility of children’s language, culture, and identity in the environment and programme</li>
<li>giving greater prominence across the centre to Māori perspectives in programmes and practices.</li>
</ul><p>Some rooms have particular programme strengths, for example bicultural and multicultural practices, that are not as evident in other rooms. The centre manager and teachers now need to consider ways to develop greater consistency for children and their families as they move through the centre, by identifying where best practice is occurring, and making these practices more widely evident across the centre.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edukids Delamain completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edukids Delamain will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Māori (Acting)</p><p>2 November 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
