<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Aspiring Beginnings Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Aspiring Beginnings Early Learning Centre is a community-based service in central Wanaka providing care and education for up to 40 children from birth to five years of age. There is a separate area for infants and toddlers, and the layout of the centre allows older and younger children to have frequent contact with each other. The centre is governed by a parent-led committee. The committee employs more teachers than are required to meet licensing requirements and actively fundraise to support this.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO review, teachers have taken steps to address the recommendations in that report. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>a review of the centre operations and teachers roles and responsibilities.</li>
<li>helping children become more confident with Information Communication Technologies (ICT) by using e-portfolios to revisit their learning.</li>
</ul><p>Records of planning, assessment and evaluation still require ongoing development.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families benefit from positive, sensitive and nurturing relationships with their teachers. The teachers have conversations with them that show they know about their home lives and the things that are important to them. A feature of this centre is the involvement of some grandparents in the centre. This is of benefit to many of the children who do not have extended family in Wanaka.</p><p>Children play and learn in safe and interesting indoor and outdoor environments. The outdoor area offers challenge and interest that invites children to explore and be involved in a range of activities. Children have strong friendships with each other. They play well together and independently. They decide what they want to do during the day. Teachers support them in their play. The children enjoy many outings in the local community.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from a small group size and consistent caregiving. Teachers have caring relationships with them. Parents and wh&#257;nau exchange useful information with the teachers about their children&rsquo;s&rsquo; care needs.</p><p>The teachers follow the infants and toddlers lead and know what the children want by understanding their expressions and actions. Teachers recognise the need to encourage and support children&rsquo;s developing independence.</p><p>The centre has a strong focus on sustainability. The teachers help children to tend a large vegetable garden, be involved in recycling and making compost, and taking care of centre animals. The children help to prepare the vegetables for the centre meals. They have learned about healthy eating as part of the Heart Foundation&rsquo;s silver healthy heart award.</p><p>The programme is based on key learning areas. Teachers appropriately foster children&rsquo;s responsibility, relationships, independence, communication, early-literacy and problem-solving skills. Children benefit from a programme that is beginning to include M&#257;ori perspectives.</p><p>Teachers work well together. At the start of the day, they meet in their teams to discuss aspects of the programme and some of the children's needs. The committee provides very good support for ongoing professional development. The teachers have recently had professional development to build their knowledge and understanding of self review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The committee and teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that they need to develop a new plan to guide the centre&rsquo;s future direction. They should ensure that the strategic plan covers all aspects of policy and practice and centre operations.</p><p>The committee and teachers need to further develop their understanding and use of self review. This should include a review schedule that includes all aspects of the operation of the service over time. The information gained from self review should be used by the committee to make decisions about future improvements. They need better evidence to assure them how well the centre promotes positive outcomes for children. This includes ensuring that there is an effective appraisal process for the senior staff.</p><p>Records of planning, assessment and evaluation need to be improved to show more clearly what learning is intended. Records need to show the teaching practices and possible experiences teachers will use to promote children&rsquo;s learning. They should then evaluate the effectiveness of these.</p><p>Teachers should show how they have responded to parents&rsquo; aspirations and extended each child&rsquo;s strengths, interests and abilities.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Aspiring Beginnings Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select &lsquo;have&rsquo; or &lsquo;have not&rsquo; taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><p>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</p><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>27 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
