</table><p>Rainbow Bears Preschool is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rainbow Bears Preschool is a privately-owned education and care centre. The service provides for children from birth to five years of age.</p><p>The centre operates in a large renovated house. An upstairs section caters for infants and toddlers. The extensive indoor and outdoor areas on the ground floor cater for children from two to five years of age. Children and their families come from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds. Many children speak more than one language.</p><p>The long-serving centre director leads a team of nine qualified and registered teachers and two unqualified staff, including a centre chef. Several teachers have been with Rainbow Bears for many years.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report noted many positive aspects of practice and these have been maintained. Good progress has been made in areas identified as requiring further development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at Rainbow Bears Preschool experience calm and unhurried routines which offer a balance between free play and semi-structured play. They settle easily into a peaceful environment where they make independent play choices. Children experience an environment that is thoughtfully and widely resourced, including equipment that reflects Māori and Pacific cultures.</p><p>The small group size benefits infants and toddlers, and these children receive high quality care and education. Teachers are attuned to the needs and routines of individual children. They provide a rich environment that supports young children with their language development and acquisition.</p><p>Children are very well supported by teachers to develop social competence. Ministry of Education tools and resources are used to extend bicultural understanding and the values within the Treaty of Waitangi. Children's sense of wellbeing and belonging is promoted through the use of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and Tapasā frameworks to strengthen the curriculum.</p><p>Leaders and teachers work in partnership with whānau and outside agencies to improve and enhance the learning for children with additional learning needs. The centre has a strong focus on inclusive practices that enables children to participate and engage with the curriculum.</p><p>Programme planning is based on teachers' observations of children's interests, learning dispositions and relevant early childhood theories. Teachers thoughtfully respond by establishing an environment that encourages children to think, explore and discover. Leaders and teachers work well together as a team. An internal evaluation process is well established and encourages teachers to reflect on and modify their practice. This process has helped identify current strategic goals.</p><p>Management of the centre is efficient and highly effective. The centre director promotes a shared decision-making approach to the centre's strategic direction. Leaders value staff contribution and provide staff with purposeful, professional development for the growth of their practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre director agree that next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>include reference to children's cultures and identity more explicitly in portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the centre philosophy to reflect new learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue with internal evaluation to foster leadership capabilities, specifically around assessment and planning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rainbow Bears Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services<br>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</p><p>27 February 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h4>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h4><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
