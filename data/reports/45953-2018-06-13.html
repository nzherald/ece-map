</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Stepping Stones Early Childhood Education is a privately owned and operated rural service located on the coastal community of Okāto, Taranaki. The service is licensed to provide education and care from Monday to Friday for 30 children over two years. Of the 34 children enrolled, eight are Māori.</p><p>A board of directors govern and manage the service. They uphold the vision of those that first established the centre to serve its community. Since the July 2014 ERO report, a new centre manager has been appointed to oversee the day-to-day operation. Four of the staff members are registered and qualified.</p><p>The philosophy gives priority to empowering children, families and whānau through decision-making opportunities.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified areas requiring further development. These included: community consultation; staff consistency in evaluation and teaching practices; growing teacher and leadership capability; and shared responsibility for centre operation across the team. Progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy is effectively implemented in practice. Children enjoy the breadth of learning opportunities offered in the well-resourced environments as adventurers, risk takers, problem solvers and creators.</p><p>Children experience positive, responsive interactions with peers and adults. Their choices for participation in learning are well supported through routines that encourage independence and self-belief. They communicate with confidence and demonstrate belonging and ownership in the centre.</p><p>The curriculum is well informed by group planning and the aspirations parents and whānau have for their children. Children’s interests, preferences, dispositions and strengths are highly evident within learning assessment stories. Increased parent participation in informing and guiding their children's learning is evident in the introduced online programme.</p><p>Intentional teaching purposefully guides and supports children’s progression and continuity of learning. Links to strategic goals, the philosophy and <em>Te Whāriki</em> are incorporated.</p><p>Children positively experience learning in literacy, mathematics, creative arts, construction and physical exploration. They are engaged and sustained learners. Leaders and teachers have identified that a key next step is to deepen their analysis and evaluation of children’s learning to improve decision making. ERO's evaluation confirms this direction.</p><p>Te ao Māori is highly evident in the environment. Visual displays include Māori artefacts, kupu Māori, Māori art and design and children's pepeha. Children participate in te reo me ngā tikanga Māori rituals and learning experiences that include karakia, waiata and stories. Leaders identify the need to further strengthen te ao Māori knowledge and understandings of Taranaki landmarks and localised stories.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well supported and this includes external agency input. The centre has well-considered transition processes into, within and onto other school services.</p><p>Governors demonstrate a strong commitment to the enactment of the philosophy, vision and goals of the centre. Useful systems and processes guide practices. The centre's strategic plan, vision and philosophy provide clear direction for leaders and teachers.</p><p>Review for improvement and accountability is well established. The centre manager continues to build understanding of internal evaluation through professional learning support. Leaders acknowledge internal evaluation requires further development. Next steps include: evaluating the impact of teaching practices on learning outcomes for children; using indicators that are measurable; inclusion of multiple voices; and growing teacher's knowledge to monitor and evaluate effectiveness.</p><p>Changes to the appraisal process align with recently developed job descriptions. It has the potential to enhance teachers' professional growth and outcomes for children. Leaders acknowledge a next step is to fully implement this process for all staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders agree with ERO that with teachers they should continue to build:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>confidence and capability in te reo me ngā tikanga Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shared understandings of assessment for learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>robust staff appraisal practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Stepping Stones Early Childhood Education completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Stepping Stones Early Childhood Education will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>13 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
