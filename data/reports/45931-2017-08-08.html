</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Foxton Preschool and Nursery is a privately owned centre, located at Foxton Beach. It is licensed to provide all day education and care for 47 children, including 18 up to two years of age. Of the 65 currently enrolled, 30 are Māori.</p><p>The service's philosophy is underpinned by the aspirations for children of the local iwi, Ngāti Raukawa. It emphasises the importance of kaitiakitanga, manaakitanga, rangatiratanga, pukengatanga and whanaungatanga for all those involved.</p><p>The centre is one of eight services overseen by two visiting centre managers. Their role is to monitor the quality of the curriculum and support the head teacher who is responsible for day-to-day management. Together, they ensure compliance with the Education (early childhood services) Regulations, and contribute to teachers' professional growth and development.</p><p>There have been significant leadership and staff changes within the last year.</p><p>In response to community feedback the centre has recently completed building renovations to provide more child spaces. At the time of ERO's evaluation, relicensing by the Ministry of Education was underway. When complete, this should increase licence numbers to 70.</p><p>The service has progressed the key next steps outlined in ERO's April 2014 report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The recently revised philosophy strongly reflects the values of teachers, parents and local iwi. Useful statements support staff understanding of ways this is enacted in practice.</p><p>Children make choices about their learning within a programme designed to support their interests. They demonstrate independence, empathy and a sense of belonging. A wide range of resources promotes exploration of the arts, science, literacy and numeracy.</p><p>Infants and toddlers freely explore age-appropriate resources. They are cared for by teachers who are responsive to their cues and developing communication.</p><p>Teachers know children well. They work alongside them to support activities and closely observe their interests and interactions. Supporting social competence is a priority. Children are involved in sustained play by themselves and alongside their peers.</p><p>Inclusion of children with additional learning needs is promoted through a range of responsive strategies. Staff work with outside agencies and parents to plan for and progress positive outcomes for these children.</p><p>Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori and te ao Māori perspectives are increasingly reflected in the curriculum. Children have opportunities to be involved in kapa haka. The centre shows ongoing commitment to achieving educational success for Māori children. Strong connections are developing with local iwi and kaumatua. Relationships with parents and families are evident. The potential of Māori children and whānau is recognised through local history and links made within their whakapapa.</p><p>Children’s engagement and participation in the programme are regularly observed, documented and reviewed. Learning stories assessment recognises and celebrate their achievements. To further improve assessment, planning and evaluation teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>show how children are progressing over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop meaningful learning partnerships with parents and respond to their aspirations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>better integrate children's cultural information into individual assessment, planning and evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Staff have identified that transitions into, within and from the centre require significant strengthening. Reciprocal relationships are developing with several primary schools. Children are given regular opportunities to experience a school environment. A key next step is to develop strategies and guidelines to better support children's and families' transitions.</p><p>Teachers are well supported to grow their practice. An effective appraisal and mentoring system gives regular feedback on their teaching. Emergent leadership is encouraged using staff strengths. A recently devised strategic plan gives clear direction for future improvements.</p><p>Leaders and managers are improvement focussed. The centre manager provides staff with clear guidance, in line with current best practice. Managers should further develop understanding amongst staff to support the successful enactment of policies. Internal evaluation for improvement is being supported by a well-designed framework. Strengthening monitoring and evaluation of the actions taken to improve outcomes for children is needed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified that the key next steps are to further develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strategies to support transitions into, within and from the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a shared understanding of policies and practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation for improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Foxton Preschool and Nursery completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Foxton Preschool and Nursery will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>8 August 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
