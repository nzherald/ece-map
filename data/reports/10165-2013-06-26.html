</table><p>The aoga teachers have yet to develop an adequate process to monitor the quality of planning, assessment and evaluation of children’s learning. The provision of an effective educational programme for all age groups has not developed sufficiently since the 2012 ERO review.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kenese Aoga Niue is located in Otara, South Auckland and is governed by the Otara Pacific Island Presbyterian Church. The centre receives administration support that is contracted through an external provider.</p><p>The secure building that houses the aoga has one main indoor area used by the different age groups and a shared outdoor environment, which is undergoing development.</p><p>The aoga provides all day education and care services for children from one to five years of age. The centre is welcoming and inclusive. Children are mainly of Niue heritage from the local community and are learning to use the Niue language in group situations, such as singing and listening to teachers’ instructions. Staff also identify closely with children from other Pacific backgrounds.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report recommended that centre managers and teachers receive external support to help them implement effective programmes for children’s learning. Governance and management processes also needed support and health and safety issues needed to be addressed. Some progress has been made in the last twelve months in relation to these recommendations, particularly in service systems and operations.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers and staff know their children well and relationships in the centre are affirming and supportive. Children connect with Niue heritage and language through their interactions with teachers and cultural displays in play areas. Parent involvement in the centre is encouraged and teachers, when they meet with families, suggest ways to help with children’s learning at home.</p><p>The teaching team is becoming more qualified and is beginning to benefit from some professional development on children’s learning programmes. Goals set for professional development should be clearly outlined and should be evaluated within a specific timeframe, to ensure that teachers are making progress.</p><p>A performance management system has been implemented but managers should review the teaching objectives in the aoga’s current appraisal format. The NZ Teachers’ Council criteria for registered teachers would be a more appropriate tool for assessing teachers’ levels of capability.</p><p>The aoga has a revised charter and an action plan. Some self review of the centre’s philosophy has been completed and governance policies have been updated. Several health and safety issues noted in the 2012 ERO report have been addressed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teaching supervisor and staff must prioritise extending children’s learning by offering a more challenging and varied programme. Meaningful professional development in relation to the curriculum document, <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, is urgently required.</p><p>Programme planning should be based on children’s individual needs and interests rather than on pre-planned activities. Effective planning systems should show what teachers are noticing and recognising in children’s play. The choice of resources, equipment and materials in the play environment should be indicative of teachers’ plans of how to respond to children’s interests.</p><p>Expectations of the teachers’ role in supporting children’s learning should be more explicit and aligned to current best practice in early childhood education. Shared approaches that lead to high quality learning interactions with children should also be developed by the teaching team.</p><p>ERO recommends that managers and teachers continue to access external support to develop:</p><ul>
<li>evaluative reporting</li>
<li>the implementation of robust, improvement-focused self review</li>
<li>improved curriculum leadership, programme planning and assessment</li>
<li>appropriate resources and teaching materials that are prompted by children’s current needs and interests.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kenese Aoga Niue completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance. To meet requirements, the service needs to improve its performance by:</p><ul>
<li>establishing processes for systematic review of all aspects of centre operations</li>
</ul><p><em>Statement of Desirable Objectives and Priorities 10</em> E</p><ul>
<li>planning, implementing and evaluating programmes that respond to the interests, strengths and capabilities of children and show an understanding of early childhood learning and development and a knowledge of relevant theories and practice</li>
</ul><p><em>Education (ECC) Regulations 1998, Regulation 32 (a) (b) (c).</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develop a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kenese Aoga Niue will be in two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>26 June 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
