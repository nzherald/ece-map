</table><p>Learning Adventures Airport Oaks is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Learning Adventures Airport Oaks is located in the industrial area of Mangere near the Auckland airport. The centre was previously known as Kids Connection Daycare Limited. It is licensed to provide for up to 100 children, including 30 children up to two years of age. Most children have either Māori or Pacific cultural heritage and there are small groups of children from diverse cultural backgrounds. The centre operates in purpose-built facilities and provides a van service for families who require transport.<br> <br> The centre operates within three age specific rooms. Kiwi is for infants and toddlers, Pukeko for two to three year olds, and Fantails for older children. Each room has a head teacher and other registered teachers. The centre manager has been in her role for almost a year, while the assistant manager and area manager are new to their roles.<br> <br> The centre's philosophy espouses child-focused and nurturing teaching that is based on whānau aspirations. It highlights the importance of effective relationships with families, celebrating cultural diversity and valuing child-initiated play.<br> <br> The centre is part of the Evolve Education Group’s Upper North Island region. Evolve provides an overarching governance and management framework. The intent of a recent re-branding of Evolve services has been to build a greater sense of unity across the organisation. It has allowed each centre to identify a preferred philosophical approach.<br> <br> Recent Evolve initiatives are intended to improve staff retention, promote effective internal evaluation and lift the quality of teaching practices. A new general manager and area managers provide professional support for centre leaders and teachers. Further recruitment is underway for managers to lead a focus on continuing quality improvement across the organisation. There continues to be a period of transition for staff as they adapt to changes in Evolve operational practices.<br> <br> This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the Evolve Education Group, Upper North Island region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers have positive, sensitive and responsive relationships with children and their whānau. Families are welcomed and children have a strong sense of belonging in the centre. Children are confident explorers and make independent choices about their play. They use their experiences and the resources provided to build on their imaginative play to develop their creativity.</p><p>Infants and toddlers have a spacious indoor and outdoor area for uninterrupted play. Teachers set an unhurried tone in the programme. As a result, children experience a warm and nurturing environment. They explore their space with confidence and are calm and settled.</p><p>The curriculum is inclusive of, and responsive to, children's culture and language. A strong focus on bicultural practices and te ao Māori helps ensure that Māori children and their whānau experience their culture positively in the programme. Teachers are committed to strengthening the centre's bicultural curriculum.</p><p>The environment is attractive and welcoming. The large outdoor environment encourages physical play for children. The indoor spaces have well-defined areas for exploration. Teachers deliberately plan to make good use of the space. Science, technology, mathematics and literacy are evident in the programme.</p><p>Teachers capture children's learning and attributes in individual portfolios. Parents appreciate the open communication they have with teachers about their children. An online tool enables teachers to promptly share children's experiences with parents and whānau.</p><p>The new centre manager is providing continuity for staff and whānau and is successfully maintaining the centre's positive culture. The centre manager and head teachers are focused on leading positive developments.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that improvements to the programme for children should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implementing planning and assessment processes that are well supported by quality resources and are more responsive to children's identified interests and needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting teachers to gain an understanding of the revised early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki,</em> and its implications for teaching practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During ERO’s August 2018 cluster, Evolve Education Group Managers agreed that next steps for improvement included:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increased integration of the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the alignment of strategic goals and annual plans with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitoring the roles and responsibilities of leaders at organisation and centre levels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the effective implementation of appraisal practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This current cluster review also identified the need for:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a coherent change management strategy, and monitoring the effectiveness of the new structure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support for centres through changes of key leaders, including area and centre managers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the evaluation of teaching and learning across the organisation to inform the next steps in professional learning and development (PLD) and the development of the teaching and learning teams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>high quality PLD for area managers to help them to evaluate and promote quality provision for children, and to identify priorities for supporting centre managers.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Learning Adventures Airport Oaks completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Learning Adventures Airport Oaks will be in three years.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>31 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
