<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Waikato Family Homebased Childcare, Network 3, provides home-based education and care for children from birth to school age in Hamilton. Educators care for up to four children at a time in their homes, and are supported by a registered early childhood teacher. This network is licensed to cater for up to 60 children at any one time, and currently has 95 children enrolled, 33 of whom are babies or toddlers. It is one of three networks operating under the same governance.</p><p>Relationships among educators, visiting teachers, and children are positive and respectful. Children demonstrate high levels of trust and confidence in educators and develop good friendships with other children. Babies and toddlers benefit from caring interactions that support their learning and care. Educators provide welcoming and well-prepared home environments. They make good use of the organisation&rsquo;s equipment, playgroups and gym programme, as well as interesting features of the local environment.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to develop early concepts about literacy and mathematics, participate in creative activities, and learn about the world around them. They are able to make choices, and educators notice and respond to their interests and strengths. Parents are well informed about their children&rsquo;s well-being, learning and progress through daily journals and individual portfolios. The service has established open and supportive communication systems to meet the needs of families and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>The visiting teacher for Network 3 works collegially with other visiting teachers to share responsibility across the service. She forms strong relationships with educators to provide highly professional support and guidance. The visiting teacher also undertakes regular health and safety checks of educators&rsquo; homes, as required by regulation. A next step is to give educators greater responsibility for ensuring the safety of their home environments.</p><p>Experienced and knowledgeable managers continue to set high standards and provide clear guidelines for visiting teachers and educators. The service uses self review to identify areas for improvement. Developing, monitoring and reviewing strategic goals for the quality of education and care would improve outcomes for children and their families.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Waikato Family Homebased Childcare provides education and care for children and their families in the greater Hamilton area. Because educators have completed the orientation module of the Certificate in Family Daycare, Network 3 receives quality funding. The visiting teacher makes regular visits to educators&rsquo; homes. As part of this review, ERO reviewers visited four homes in the network.</p><p>Waikato Family Homebased Childcare aims to &lsquo;give children opportunities which will enhance their development for life, supported by educators, in warm and caring home environments.&rsquo;</p><h3>Areas of good performance</h3><p>Interactions: Interactions amongst educators, visiting teachers and children are positive, respectful and responsive. Children are settled and they demonstrate high levels of trust and confidence in their friends and educators. They take ownership of and responsibility for their learning and make choices about following their interests and returning to extend earlier experiences.</p><p>Educators listen and talk with children to hear about their ideas and extend their thinking. These frequent conversations are developing children&rsquo;s oral language and communication skills. Babies benefit from caring interactions that are responsive to their needs and preferences, and which stimulate their early language development.</p><p>Parents and educators appreciate a positive partnership in caring for children. They are well informed about children&rsquo;s learning and care through a wide range of formal and informal communications, including information and communication technologies (ICT).</p><p>The visiting teacher supports educators in their roles. During visits to homes and playgroups, the visiting teacher models good practice through her high-quality interactions with children. She provides educators with appropriate equipment and information about learning and teaching in early childhood. The visiting teacher&rsquo;s written and oral feedback gives educators valuable guidance.</p><p>Learning environment: Educators provide for children in welcoming and well-prepared home environments. Babies, toddlers and older children are able to use a wide range of equipment that supports their learning and development. Art work, including painting, drawing and writing is a popular feature of some homes. Children enjoy reading books and hearing stories. Many educators attend the organisation&rsquo;s twice-weekly playgroups and weekly gym sessions for children. They may also attend music groups, visit other educators, and local places of interest. In addition, the organisation arranges and funds excursions twice a term for all educators and children. Parents are also invited to take part.</p><p>Indoor and outdoor environments allow children to explore and investigate the world around them. Some educators involve children in gardening, and use the environment to introduce children to early concepts about natural science. The service supports educators in their role by providing a generous variety of additional learning equipment and good quality nursery furniture.</p><p>Programme: The programme offers children meaningful learning opportunities in home-based contexts. Children&rsquo;s experiences are recorded in daily journals, and also in individual portfolios, using photographs and learning stories. These make children&rsquo;s learning, development and progress visible for families and children to share. Educators use their knowledge of children&rsquo;s preferred routines and interests to design challenging daily programmes.</p><p>Leadership: The experienced and knowledgeable directors continue to set high standards and provide clear guidelines for network operations. A recently appointed team leader is providing valuable support. The highly effective visiting teachers are establishing strong collegial relationships. Opportunities are available for professional development that increases their knowledge of up-to-date practice and theory in early childhood education.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>Self review: Agreed next steps for management are to improve self review by:</p><ul>
<li>documenting annual and strategic goals that focus on the quality of education and care, and monitor progress</li>
<li>providing visiting teachers with ongoing, documented feedback about their practice as a basis for further reflection</li>
<li>supporting educators to take greater responsibility for monitoring health and safety daily in their homes to meet management's expectations.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h4>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h4><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing wellbeing, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3><p>Waikato Family Homebased Care has an inclusive approach to providing education and care. The service&rsquo;s three networks cooperate to provide appropriate placements for all children. Network 3 is a quality-funded network with experienced, confident educators. It is well placed to enrol children with moderate to severe special needs.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><p>Support for transitions: Children are well supported to settle in the educator&rsquo;s home. Parents are able to choose from a range of homes, and visiting teachers assist the educators to provide a secure, responsive learning and care environment for each child. Extensive communication among families, educators and the visiting teacher allow a flexible approach to meeting parent aspirations and diverse requirements. These provisions reflect the organisation&rsquo;s commitment to &lsquo;giving children opportunities which will enhance their development for life, supported by educators, in warming and caring home environments&rsquo;.</p><p>Learning and development: The small group settings in home-based care allow educators to provide individualised programmes. Educators in this network are well placed to add specialised activities and routines to their wide range of learning experiences. The visiting teacher is experienced and knowledgeable about early childhood education, and can provide information and readings to extend educators&rsquo; knowledge about catering for special education and care needs.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Waikato Family Homebased Childcare (3) - 2005 Ltd completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
