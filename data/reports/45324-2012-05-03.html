<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>St Andrews Playcentre is located in Hamilton and is licensed to cater for children from birth to two years of age. It operates under the umbrella of the Waikato Playcentre Association. The playcentre provides a specialised programme for mainly first-time parents with new-born babies, through the<em> Supporting Parents Alongside Their Children&rsquo;s Education</em> (SPACE) programme. The programme was developed by the Hutt Playcentre Association in conjunction with the Ministry of Education and Victory University.</p><p>The playcentre operates as a parent co-operative, and commits to children learning through play, with family involvement. St Andrews Playcentre began implementing its SPACE programme in 2008. It has a full roll, and provides morning and afternoon sessions five days per week.</p><p>The Waikato Association supports the service by providing effective leadership and management. Experienced and knowledgeable SPACE coordinators and facilitators ensure the quality of programme delivery. The programme at St Andrews playcentre provides extensive support, and successfully empowers parents in their role as first educators of their babies. A strength is the opportunity for parents to network with other families and community groups to share knowledge and experiences about parenting. Through education programmes, parents are able to further enhance their understanding about how children learn and develop. The playcentre coordinators and facilitators have identified, and ERO agrees, that there is a need to increase the M&#257;ori dimension within the programme.</p><p>Parents and babies are welcomed into a well-prepared learning environment and programme that caters for the diverse ages and stages of babies. A notable feature of the programme is that babies are exposed to rich language and literacy experiences. Trusting and mutually respectful relationships and interactions are evident at all levels, and babies benefit from the social interactions they experience with other adults and their peers. Parents have the opportunity to develop friendships, and have meaningful conversations that are focused on the best possible outcomes for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of St Andrews Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atSt Andrews Playcentre.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The purpose of the SPACE programme is to improve the well-being of children and enhance their holistic development. Emphasis is placed on supporting parents, through group parenting sessions, that provide opportunities for them to connect with other families and community groups. The programme is run by experienced facilitators and coordinators.</p><p>The programmes are designed to strengthen families/wh&#257;nau, through the provision of quality parenting support and early childhood experiences for infants. The aim is to support families and communities so that every child has the opportunity to thrive, with an emphasis on family being central to a community&rsquo;s well-being.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><strong>Support for parents:</strong> The SPACE programme provides extensive support and empowers parents in their role as first educators of their babies. A strength is the opportunities for parents to network with other families and community groups and share their own knowledge and experiences about parenting. Parent education provided by community professionals and the facilitators also increases parents&rsquo; understanding about how children learn and develop. Parents, with the support of facilitators, have developed child portfolios that provide a rich record of the learning and development of their baby.</p><p><strong>Programme and environment:</strong> Parents and babies are welcomed into a well-prepared learning environment with a planned programme specifically catering for the diverse ages and stages of babies. Parents are empowered in their understanding about how children learn and develop through play. A notable feature of the programme is babies being exposed to rich language and literacy experiences. The playcentre coordinators and facilitators have identified, and ERO agrees, that there is a need to increase the M&#257;ori dimension within the programme.</p><p><strong>Interactions:</strong> Trusting and mutually respectful relationships and interactions are evident at all levels. Parents have the opportunity to develop friendships and have meaningful conversations about parenting and the usefulness of the knowledge they have gained from the programme. Babies benefit from the social interactions they experience with other adults and their peers.</p><p><strong>Association support:</strong> The Waikato Association provides effective leadership and management for the playcentre. Experienced and knowledgeable SPACE coordinators and facilitators ensure the quality of programme delivery. There is a good range of self-review processes in place to monitor the effectiveness of the programme, and adapt and improve delivery. Facilitators and coordinators successfully empower parents in their parental roles and knowledge about babies&rsquo; learning and development. A recent initiative that has been introduced is trialling an After SPACE programme to support parents&rsquo; transition to mainstream playcentre. The coordinators are in the process of reviewing the effectiveness and necessity of this programme. ERO agrees it would be useful to evaluate its success and plan for the future.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of St Andrews Playcentre completed an ERO <em>Centre Assurance Statement</em> and <em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

Experienced and knowledgeable SPACE coordinators and facilitators ensure the quality of programme delivery. The programme at St Andrews playcentre provides extensive support, and successfully empowers parents in their role as first educators of their babies. A strength is the opportunity for parents to network with other families and community groups to share knowledge and experiences about parenting. Through education programmes, parents are able to further enhance their understanding about how children learn and develop. The playcentre coordinators and facilitators have identified, and ERO agrees, that there is a need to increase the M&#257;ori dimension within the programme.</p><p>Parents and babies are welcomed into a well-prepared learning environment and programme that caters for the diverse ages and stages of babies. A notable feature of the programme is that babies are exposed to rich language and literacy experiences. Trusting and mutually respectful relationships and interactions are evident at all levels, and babies benefit from the social interactions they experience with other adults and their peers. Parents have the opportunity to develop friendships, and have meaningful conversations that are focused on the best possible outcomes for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education &ndash;</strong> including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
