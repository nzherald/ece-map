</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Above &amp; Beyond Education and Care is a privately owned education and care service located in the Tauranga suburb of Gate Pa. It is licensed to cater for 50 children including 15 aged under two years. The current roll of 58 includes 12 who are Māori and a small number are of Pacific origin. The service operates flexible hours for families on Monday to Friday between 7.30 and 5.30. The centre philosophy of 'love at the heart of our teaching and love as an intentional response to promote wellbeing' is clearly articulated by leaders, teachers and parents.</p><p>The centre is divided into three age-based areas for babies, toddlers and older pre-school children. The service is one of four centres in the wider Western Bay of Plenty owned by the Above and Beyond Company. The owner/director provides overall leadership and direction for the service and the educational leader oversees the day-to-day management and delivery of the education and care programme. All teachers are qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>The service has a positive reporting history with ERO and responded well to the areas for improvement identified in the 2013 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience warm, trusting relationships with teachers that foster their individual identities and build on their strengths. Teachers have well-developed, positive guidance strategies that encourage self-management skills and develop children's social competencies. An inclusive culture supports all children to participate fully in the programme and where necessary, work with specialists to support children and their parents.</p><p>The centre programme is planned in response to children's interests and ideas. It is based on <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum and is underpinned by an arts-based approach with a growing focus on the integration of science, technology and health. Early mathematics and literacy learning opportunities are effectively integrated throughout the programme. Parents and whānau have access to a web-based record of their child's learning and development and have the opportunity to contribute to learning stories. A useful next step is for teachers is to strengthen the planning and assessment process in learning stories, to show more clearly how they add complexity to children's ideas and interests over time.</p><p>The centre is very well-resourced and children have access to an extensive range of equipment, which encourages them to be innovative and imaginative with resources that invite creativity. The outdoor environment enables children to be involved in making decisions and choices about the use of equipment. There are many opportunities for them to take risks and challenge themselves in physical activities. Flexible routines allow and encourage children to engage in sustained periods of uninterrupted play.</p><p>Babies and toddlers experience nurturing relationships with their teachers built on high levels of trust. Strong attachments with babies are promoted by consistency and continuity of care. These processes foster a strong sense of belonging and aroha. Teaching interactions for these young children are unhurried and are responsive to each child's rhythms, home routines and non-verbal cues. Babies are offered choices and encouraged to problem solve in a well-resourced environment that provides physical and cognitive challenges in a safe, calm setting.</p><p>The centre recognises the diversity of children with Pacific heritage and fosters the understanding that language and culture are key to all children's identity and positive sense of self. A significant and mutually beneficial initiative has been the establishment of a partnership with a nearby early childhood service to promote the sharing of knowledge, skills and expertise about Pacific and Māori culture. This ongoing relationship is supporting teachers growing confidence to use te reo Māori and integrating appropriate concepts such as manaakitanga and whanaungatanga in the daily programme and learning stories. The centre acknowledges the value of continuing to further embed te reo and tikanga Māori in the programme.</p><p>The director works closely with the educational leader to successfully promote a shared leadership model. A collaborative style of working is fostered with an ongoing focus on improving the quality of education and care. Leaders have established a culture of respect, trust and reciprocity among the teaching team and with parents and whānau. This contributes to a strong sense of community for children and families who feel welcome and actively involved in the decisions that affect their children. Leaders have a well-developed understanding of self-review seeking multiple perspectives to inform future centre direction and development.</p><p>The owner/director continues to provide strong governance, leadership and direction for the service. The educational leader ensures the enactment of the centre's philosophy and promoting positive outcomes for children and families. The strategic plan provides clarity of direction for centre development and a sound basis for continuing review and improvement. A detailed policy and procedural framework contributes to children's wellbeing and safety.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next step is to continue to refine and strengthen the appraisal processes to meet the requirements of the Education Council to clearly show how teachers are improving their practice. This needs to include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>reflection on the evidence provided of meeting each of the practicing teacher criteria</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>specific and measureable goals for professional growth aligned to relevant professional development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>targeted observations that include documented high quality feedback and next steps for teachers focussed on improving outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Above and Beyond Education and Care completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Above &amp; Beyond Education and Care will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>18 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
