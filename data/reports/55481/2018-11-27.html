</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bright Futures CHB 1 is a community home-based education and care service operating under the governance of the Napier Family Centre. In-home childcare is offered by educators who work in their own homes for children aged from birth to five years. This is a quality funded network, licensed for 80 children including 80 up to two years old. Of the 64 children currently enrolled, 11 identify as Māori.</p><p>The recently reviewed philosophy emphasises the importance of relationships, community connections and supporting children's identity and culture.</p><p>There are four Bright Futures home-based education and care networks. These operate in Napier, Hastings and Central Hawkes Bay. A service manager is responsible for oversight of these services and oversees the work of visiting teachers. She reports to the Napier Family Centre chief executive officer (CEO) and board of governors.</p><p>Two qualified visiting teachers have responsibility for this network. Their role is to support educarers to implement suitable early childhood programmes. They also provide a community playgroup in Waipukurau that many educarers and children attend.</p><p>Since the March 2015 ERO report, there have been significant changes in the management team, including the appointment of a new home-based service manager and the disestablishment of the divisional manager role. The service manager now undertakes the duties and responsibilities of this position, alongside the manager of the Napier Family Centre Sunny Days service.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified areas for network improvements in: self review; educarer development; parent partnership; bicultural practice; and provision for children up to the age of two. Good progress has been made in these areas. Key next steps for governance around strategic planning, curriculum leadership and appraisals have also advanced.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in a curriculum that is responsive to their interests and dispositions for learning. A wide range of opportunities to explore the local community is a regular part of the programme. These provide meaningful experiences for children to make connections with the world around them.</p><p>Leaders and educators are growing their knowledge and understanding of te ao Māori concepts. The use of te reo Māori is increasingly visible within children's documentation. Regular excursions in the community provide plentiful opportunities for children to connect with significant landmarks. Leaders have identified that strengthening relationships with local iwi is a key next step.</p><p>Meaningful strategies are in place to support Māori learners to achieve educational success. Leaders agree with ERO, that it is timely to evaluate the effectiveness of practices on improving outcomes for Māori children.</p><p>Educators are proactive in extending their own knowledge to support and respond to the individual needs of children. Documentation shows they engage in regular conversations with visiting teachers and families about children's interests. Leaders provide ongoing professional learning opportunities and use strategic modelling of practice, to respond to children’s needs and parent aspirations.</p><p>Children’s profile books effectively record their interests, participation and progression of learning over time. Visiting teachers and educarers work collaboratively to reinforce sound assessment, planning and evaluation. To strengthen practice, visiting teachers should clearly show their contribution to assessment documentation to demonstrate how:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>parents aspirations’ are responded to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the use of children’s culture language and identity is used to inform planning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children with diverse learning needs are well supported. Visiting teachers and educators work closely with parents to access appropriate external support if required. A collaborative approach to supporting children's individual strengths, interests and needs is promoted between the educator and parents.</p><p>Visiting teachers and educators work collegially to provide suitable resourcing that is responsive to the individual needs of infants and toddlers. This supports them to participate in a broad curriculum alongside of their peers.</p><p>Transitions into and out of the service are well considered and responsive to the children’s needs within their whānau context. Relationships with local schools continue to be strengthened.</p><p>Systems and processes that guide the networks operation have been strengthened and are regularly reviewed. Health and safety in homes is sufficiently monitored during regular checks by visiting teachers. The service manager and visiting teachers work collaboratively to improve practice and the board is well informed of outcomes for children.</p><p>Governance values the strengths and knowledge of staff, specifically in relation to Pacific children and bicultural practice, and they are encouraged to take on leadership roles. Visiting teachers are growing their understanding of teaching as inquiry as a tool to improve teaching practice. Leaders have identified that formalising the observation of teachers' practice is a next step to meet Educational Council expectations.</p><p>Self review contributes positively to organisational improvement. Leaders continue to develop their understanding and use of internal evaluation, with a clear focus on improving outcomes for children. A next step is monitor, evaluate and report on the extent to which children outcomes are improved through systems, processes and initiatives. This should include consideration of the impact of the curriculum on specific priority groups.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and ERO agree that they should continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the visibility of parents' aspirations and children’s culture, language and identity and how this is responded to within assessment documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitoring and evaluation to further inform decision making, with a particular focus on Māori learners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal to meet Education Council requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bright Futures CHB 1 completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, visiting teachers should consistently:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>include the ratios of adults to children on all permission slips and ensure that parents acknowledge this before children attend special excursions.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Managers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>formalise observations of certificated teachers' practice to meet the requirements of the Educational Council.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bright Futures CHB 1 will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>27 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
