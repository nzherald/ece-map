<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Prebbleton Kindergarten opened in 2010 and this is its first ERO review. It is one of three centres in Prebbleton owned and operated by the same managers. This centre caters for children from two-years old to school age. Nearly all the staff are qualified early childhood teachers. Many of them have worked for the same organisation for a number of years.</p><p>The centre provides a welcoming and caring environment for children. They can choose to play in interesting and engaging activities. ERO observed children who played together well and were involved in small group experiences for sustained periods of time.</p><p>Other features of the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>the spacious and well-presented indoor playing areas</li>
<li>the close relationship with the neighbouring school.</li>
</ul><p>The managers and ERO agree that the next step to further improve outcomes for children is to develop a vision that focuses on high quality learning and teaching. This includes extending teaching, promoting children&rsquo;s cultural identity and extending the review process to regularly monitor teaching practices and children&rsquo;s learning outcomes.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore, ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive outcomes for children. To reach these findings ERO evaluates:</p><ul>
<li>Mana Whakahaere &ndash; how governance and management determines the services&rsquo; vision/philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou&#257;rahi &ndash; how the leadership and capability of all involved, including educators, enhances positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is implemented to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning reflect diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas, ERO considers the effectiveness of partnerships with wh&#257;nau and self review. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at Prebbleton Kindergarten.</p><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings are set out below.</p><h3>How well placed is Prebbleton Kindergarten to promote positive outcomes for all children?</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The philosophy states that children will experience a nurturing and caring environment. Trusting relationships will be formed between the children, teachers and families. The environment will reflect New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage. The programme will be effective and meaningful for all children, and include their cultural backgrounds and interests. Teachers will provide a range of structured and self-choice activities, including daily baking.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Children&rsquo;s well-being and belonging are well catered for within the programme. They have caring and supportive relationships with their teachers. They play well together in small groups and independently, often for sustained periods of time. Parents are encouraged to share their ideas and contribute to their child&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Children make good use of the environment and resources to develop their ideas and use their imagination. The indoor environment is spacious and well used by children to support their learning. Teachers provide a wide range of activities that the children access easily and use in creative ways.</p><p>Managers and teachers are establishing regular contact with the local school to support children&rsquo;s transition to school. Children regularly visit the school next door and participate in school programmes.</p><p>Managers and teachers have developed a useful planning process that links children&rsquo;s interests to broad programme goals. They are beginning to link teaching approaches to ways that they can support individual children&rsquo;s learning. Child portfolios provide an attractive record of children&rsquo;s time at the centre and help to link home and centre learning. Managers and teachers identified that the next step is to review the effectiveness of these processes in promoting children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>The managers and ERO agree that the next steps to improve learning and teaching include:</p><ul>
<li>developing a vision and long-term direction for the centre that focuses on high quality learning, teaching and curriculum implementation</li>
<li>developing a better understanding and making more effective use of self review to improve learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>extending teaching practices to deepen children&rsquo;s thinking and problem-solving skills</li>
<li>ensuring teaching practices promote the language, culture and identity of M&#257;ori and Pacific children and children from other cultures.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Prebbleton Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
