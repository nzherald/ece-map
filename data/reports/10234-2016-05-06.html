</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Aoga a le Teuila Pre School is a Christian education and care service for children up to 5 years of age. The service operates under the Aoga a le Teuila Trust and is governed by a board of trustees. It is situated alongside of the Tamaki Pacific Islanders' Church in Glen Innes. The preschool is a Samoan bilingual service established to encourage children and their families to maintain their Samoan cultural identity, language and values.</p><p>Aoga a le Teuila Pre-School is managed by a board of trustees. The 2012 report acknowledged good management processes and planning in place to monitor the progress that the centre was making towards meeting its strategic goals</p><p>The 2012 ERO report also recommended that staff continue developing self review and transition to school processes</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children display a strong sense of belonging in the centre. They are socially and emotionally competent and relate respectfully to each other. Children enjoy both independent and collaborative play. They work patiently and persistently at tasks and are physically fit. Teachers provide an environment that allows children to make choices from a range of resources.</p><p>A next step for improving outcomes for children could be achieved by teachers developing a stronger focus on learning interactions with children. Learning programmes could be strengthened by teachers developing teaching strategies that challenge children's thinking, reasoning and problem solving. The curriculum could also include literacy, numeracy and science within the context of play.</p><p>Good systems are in place to communicate and share information with aiga/families, including using newsletters and technological systems. Aiga value learning excursions and enjoy accompanying their children on interesting trips into the community. Teachers could now build parents' understanding about how the curriculum supports children's learning and how families can develop a role in their children's learning.</p><p>Strategic planning would be more useful if it was focused on making improvements to children's learning. The teachers' appraisal system incorporates the Practising Teacher Criteria and is a valuable guide to help raise the quality of children's learning. Professional development support has been accessed to develop a policy framework. Distinguishing policies from procedures, would be a helpful approach to achieving effective policy review. Job descriptions should be kept up to date by reflecting changes in staff roles.</p><p>The board has systems in place to support the centre's daily operations. However, ERO recommends the board undertake a review of the financial viability of the centre. Other areas for the board to address include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>employing staff in excess of staffing requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aligning rates of remuneration to job descriptions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the practicality of investing funding when the centre budget operates with a deficit bank balance.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the board and centre managers agree that the following areas should be addressed by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring effective financial management practices promote the financial sustainability of the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strategic planning including a focus on strengthening the complexity of children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reducing policies to make them more useful, and reviewing policies more manageable.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Aoga a le Teuila Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>financial management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide a programme that strengthens children's learning capability through high quality interactions with teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>conduct regular fire and earthquake practices every three months</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure all non-registered staff are police vetted every three years.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7, GMA8, Criterion C3, Criterion HS8, Education Act 1989 sections 319D to 319FA.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Aoga a le Teuila Pre-School will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>6 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
