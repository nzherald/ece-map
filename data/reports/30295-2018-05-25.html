</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Coromandel Community Preschool is a not-for-profit early education and care service operated by a management committee comprising of parents and centre teachers. It is located in a purpose-built facility in the township of Coromandel. The preschool has two age-specific rooms and is licenced for a maximum of 35 children at any one time. The current roll is 41, and 19 children identify as Māori.</p><p>The management committee retain responsibility for aspects of governance including strategic and annual planning, financial and property management, the appraisal of the head teacher and a policy framework to meet legislative compliance. The experienced head teacher has responsibility for day-to-day operations of the preschool, and she works closely with other senior teachers to provide professional leadership. There have been few changes to the highly qualified teaching team in recent years.</p><p>The preschool philosophy emphasises the central importance of establishing strong relationships and partnerships built on trust, respect and open communication. Bi-cultural perspectives play an integral role in the <em>Te Whāriki</em>-based curriculum, and te ao Māori is woven throughout the programme. Children are inspired to explore, make decisions and nurture their natural abilities.</p><p>The preschool has a very positive reporting history with ERO. The management committee and centre leaders responded very effectively to the recommendation in the 2013 ERO report. Teachers have continued to develop child and whānau voice in assessment and individual portfolios and manaakitangi and whakapapa are the current focus in teaching as inquiry cycles.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Knowledgeable teachers consistently demonstrate a strong understanding of current early childhood education practice. Effective learning interactions with children are underpinned by high levels of respect and the use of a wide range of teaching strategies. Conversations with children are based on rich language and questioning, to support and extend learning and allow children to develop working theories. Children with additional needs, and their families, are well supported and fully included in all activities. Teachers are highly-reflective practitioners and are focussed on important and relevant outcomes for children.</p><p>The environment invites children’s engagement and exploration. It is well resourced and equipment is visible and accessible to children. Children also learn about their natural environment, within and outside the centre, developing strengths in sustainable practices and kaitiakitanga. The preschool is involved in a wetland development project with the Depart of Conservation. Children are able to initiate and lead their own learning.</p><p>Routines are flexible, but carefully monitored, so that play is not interrupted unnecessarily. Transitions into, within and from the preschool are personalised and responsive. Children are benefitting from a healthy, peaceful and sustainable environment, learning through play together with responsive teachers.</p><p>Very young children experience close attachments to key teachers. They experience a calm and nurturing environment which is a safe place for them to explore. These children have many opportunities to experience the natural world, and tuakana teina through their frequent interactions with older children.</p><p>Children experience a rich and emergent programme that encompasses a strong emphasis on building their sense of wellbeing and belonging. Through the localised curriculum teachers place a strong commitment on turangawaewae or a ‘place to stand’. The curriculum is extended by regular use of the local region such as the beach and bush, and shared events with the town community.</p><p>Assessment is based on teachers close knowledge of children and their families. It is focused on learning dispositions, with references to children’s interests and strengths. The preschool programme and environment encourages children to become confident and competent learners, aware of who they are and where they come from.</p><p>There is a strong commitment by leaders and staff to continue to build culturally responsive practice that affirms both Māori and children of Pacific origin. There are well-established links with the local iwi mana whenua Ngati Whanaunga, and an emphasis on values such as manaakitanga, whanaungatanga and aroha. Māori children's language, culture and identity are valued and celebrated. Preschool assessment is at the early stages of implementing Māori kaupapa approaches as identified in the Ministry of Education document, <em>Te Whatu Pōkeka</em>. All children, including Māori and Pacific, benefit from the inclusive culture and underpinning values of the preschool.</p><p>Leadership effectively builds capacity and promotes consistently high-quality outcomes for children. Staff roles and responsibilities are flexible to ensure the safe and responsive daily operations of the preschool. Leaders have established and sustained high levels of mutual trust and respect amongst the teaching team and the wider local community. These relationships promote a collaborative and reflective culture.</p><p>The preschool management committee provides effective governance that ensures the provision of high-quality education and care is sustained for all children. The board provide appropriate support for the professional development of the head teacher and staff.</p><p>Internal evaluation is well embedded and closely aligned to the priorities for individual teaching as inquiry and staff appraisals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The strategic priorities for the services ongoing development are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>fully implement the revised appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue the teacher as inquiry cycle related to acknowledging the language, culture and identity of all children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Coromandel Community Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Coromandel Community Preschool will be in four years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>25 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
