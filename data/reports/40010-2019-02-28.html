</table><p>Tauriko Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tauriko Playcentre is a parent-led education and care service located in Tauranga. It caters for children from birth to school age and operates four mixed-age morning sessions per week. The playcentre is licensed for 30 children including up to 15 under the age of two years. The current roll of 53 children includes four who identify as Māori.</p><p>During 2018 the New Zealand Playcentre Federation transitioned from operating with 32 regional associations to become one national body with six regional offices. In the central North Island six associations have merged into a regional hub renamed Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island Region that now includes 95 playcentres over a large geographic area. During this transition there is some overlap between associations and the new national regional systems and processes. At Tauriko Playcentre the co-presidents are supported by a committee of parent members. A session supervisor, centre administrator and support worker are provided by governance.</p><p>Through their national philosophy the playcentre places emphasis on whānau tupu ngātahi – families growing together. They empower adults and children to play, work and grow together and value and affirm parents as first and best educators of their children.</p><p>Tauriko Playcentre has a positive reporting history with ERO. Since the last ERO review in 2015, internal review has a more planned and deliberate focus. There has been improved understanding and use of te reo Māori and the bicultural curriculum has improved.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five playcentre reviews in the Central North Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Effective learning relationships are promoted to build on children’s knowledge and skills. Learning opportunities are child focused and parents are responsive to their children’s interests and needs. Children under the age of two years enjoy a calm and responsive learning space. It is age appropriate and allows for free movement, fostering curiosity and independence. Members are responding appropriately to young children’s routines and cues. Children experience positive and meaningful interactions where parents as first teachers is well promoted.</p><p>Children’s learning is effectively supported in an extensively equipped and attractive environment. They lead their own learning through a curriculum that is inclusive and accessible for all learners. Children are encouraged to make their own decisions and experience a wide range of choices in their play. Oral language is strongly supported through open-ended questions and children’s desire to be curious and inquire. Risk taking and challenge are promoted in the large outdoor park-like play area. Children are seen as confident learners and explorers.</p><p>Literacy and mathematics are effectively and authentically woven through play and learning. Trips and excursions into the community support meaningful learning. Planning is a collaborative process, discussed by members and areas to extend are identified at the end of session evaluation. Individual portfolios are a meaningful record of children's participation in the programme. It is now time to build parents understanding of assessment practices. This should include incorporating visibility of individual children's language, culture and identity in assessment portfolios. Children experience a curriculum where their interests and strengths are the focus for learning.</p><p>Bicultural practice is championed by leaders. Te reo Māori, waiata and karakia are incorporated in the daily learning programme. Places of local significance are valued and Māori myths and legends promoted. Tuakana teina relationships are evident through authentic interactions and intentions. Children are supported to experience the unique bicultural heritage of Aotearoa, New Zealand.</p><p>Experienced and knowledgeable leaders are providing effective support for new members. Leaders have established a positive culture for learning with a focus on building capability through role modelling good practice. Recent elections have seen all roles and responsibilities filled within the playcentre. This commitment from members and with many new families is contributing to the sustainability of the playcentre. An internal evaluation framework has been implemented and is guiding a positive review process, leading to change and improvement. The collaborative approach to leadership enables sustainability within the playcentre committee where the vision and well-designed philosophy are shared to all members. Children benefit from leaders who advocate for the playcentre and are focused on positive learning outcomes.</p><p>The Playcentre Aotearoa overarching strategic plan and individual annual plans guide the playcentre direction and focus on building capability through parent education programmes. There has been regular communication and support between the association and regions through the restructure. Existing policies and systems support centre operations until new systems developed by Playcentre Aotearoa are implemented. The playcentre philosophy and vision are clearly documented and strategic goals set,. now there is a need to measure the impact and outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Through internal evaluation there is now a need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop a shared understanding and knowledge of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki</em> to further support children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure the visibility of individual children’s language culture and identity throughout assessment and the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further refinement of the bicultural nature of the programme.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tauriko Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tauriko Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>28 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
