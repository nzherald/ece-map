</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rerewhakaaitu Playcentre is a parent-led early childhood centre that provides sessional education and care for children between birth and school age. The centre is licensed for 30 children, including up to 15 children under the age of two years. At the time of this ERO review, 26 children were enrolled, of whom 10 identify as Māori.</p><p>Parent volunteers share responsibilities for the ongoing management and day-to-day operation of the service. The centre is located near the Rerewhakaaitu School and the community hall.</p><p>The centre maintains close relationships with the local school and community. The playcentre won a 2014 TrustPower Community Award that recognised the value of centre members’ work in their small, rural community. Since the 2011 ERO review, the centre has made extensive improvements to its playground, refurbished the indoor area, and established a vegetable garden so children can harvest vegetables. Members have worked hard to raise funds for these developments. The centre supports parents to undertake parent training, and a high proportion of parents complete course one of the Playcentre Federation modules, and choose to proceed to higher levels.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of Rotorua Playcentre Association. The knowledgeable operations manager is readily available to assist with information, and an experienced centre support officer attends playcentre sessions and meetings to advise and mentor members. She reports to the association about compliance with licensing, health and safety and other operational requirements.</p><p>The playcentre education programme assists members to provide appropriate learning opportunities for their children. Recent professional development through a Ministry of Education contract has assisted the association and its centres to use a self-review process to consider how best to recruit, receive, engage and retain members. An important feature was the exploration of a simple method to help new members write stories for children’s portfolios.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five playcentre reviews in the Rotorua Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are highly engaged in play and learning in a well-resourced, attractive environment. Adult interactions with children are positive and supportive. Children develop friendships with their peers and enjoy their time at the centre. They participate in a wide range of learning opportunities that are responsive to their interests and include an emphasis on nature and science. Children are able to participate in growing, harvesting and preparing food.</p><p>The outdoor playground is well-developed, promotes a high level of physical play and includes appropriate challenges. Children enjoy regular trips that extend their knowledge of the local community and understanding of the world around them. Children’s transition to school is eased by visits between the school and the playcentre. These allow older children to become familiar with the routines of the new entrant classroom, and renew their friendships with former playmates.</p><p>Parents’ active involvement in the centre promotes a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing, both in the playcentre and in the wider community. They contribute to planning the programme, which allows free choice for children to follow their interests. Parents introduce new ideas through a annual programme theme, which has a different focus each term, and is chosen to deepen children’s learning and incorporate parents’ aspirations.</p><p>The current theme ‘culture’ includes aspects of local Māori culture and the centre appreciates participating in a weekly programme with a local expert. Children are learning waiata, te reo Māori and becoming increasingly familiar with local myths and legends. Literacy, numeracy and aspects of mathematics are included as a natural part of the programme.</p><p>Parents celebrate children’s learning through individual profile books which they develop for their children. These profiles value children’s identity, and provide a record of their playcentre experiences that can be shared with their friends and family. The centre realises that more needs to be done to develop consistency in the quality of learning stories.</p><p>The playcentre is effectively led by office holders who are highly respected by centre members. Experienced playcentre members support newer parents. Responsibilities for the day-to-day operation of the playcentre are shared by all members. Parents are encouraged to participate in playcentre training to increase their understanding of children’s learning.</p><p>The playcentre strategic plan identifies priorities for development, and is linked to agreed centre development needs. It includes a focus on Te Tiriti o Waitangi obligations and supports the long-term sustainability of the centre. Planned and spontaneous self review is undertaken to evaluate topics such as the quality of the environment, the welcoming process for new parents, and policy review. It would now be beneficial to review the quality and outcomes of the programme for children’s learning.</p><p>The Rotorua Playcentre Association provides support and guidance, and is readily available to answer questions and offer advice. The centre support officer visits each term to monitor compliance and provide feedback about centre practices and maintain communication between centre and association.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that the centre needs to consider:</p><ul>
<li>tracking the progress of strategic goals at designated times throughout the year, using indicators which describe the desired outcomes to identify next steps</li>
<li>including a self-review focus on the quality and outcomes of the programme</li>
<li>planning educators’ interactions with children to support and extend their learning.</li>
</ul><p>The association recognises and celebrates learning for both adults and children as an essential part of valuing the ‘Playcentre experience’. A strategic goal for the association and centre for identifying and building on programme successes would be to strengthen the learning opportunities and outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rerewhakaaitu Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rerewhakaaitu Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>4 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
