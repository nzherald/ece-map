</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wesley Kindergarten is located in Mt Roskill, Auckland. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 30 children over two years of age. The community is culturally diverse and many children speak languages other than English.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review the kindergarten has experienced significant change. In 2014 it changed from a sessional service to a Kindergarten Day Model (KDM) which enables children to attend sessions similar to school hours. The long-serving team changed when one teacher left and the staffing increased under the KDM. The new team comprises three teachers, a teachers’ assistant and administrator. The team is led by an experienced head teacher and supported by an education specialist who is new to her Kindergarten Association role this year. The new team is working with the education specialist to adapt to these changes.</p><p>The kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association, which provides effective leadership, a management framework, support personnel and a programme of professional development for teachers.</p><p>After extensive review, consultation and development, the Auckland Kindergarten Association has recently launched a new 10-year strategic direction. Its four strategic pillars/objectives relate to educational excellence, core organisational processes, community engagement and a future focus. These objectives are intended to guide the Association and its kindergartens in their ongoing development. The Association’s approach to bringing about a substantial change in its organisational structure has been carefully considered.</p><p>New Association roles have been established to provide more targeted support for kindergarten operations, curriculum and development. Professional development supports kindergarten head teachers in their leadership and management roles. A Quality Improvement Process (QIP) is being implemented to monitor quality in kindergartens and contributes to self review and ongoing improvement.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have fun in a play-based programme that provides them with opportunities to develop friendships. They enjoy physically active play and share positive interactions with peers and adults. Children and their families are warmly welcomed by staff. Children settle quickly at activities that staff have set up and are eager to chat about their interests. They demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing.</p><p>The environment is well resourced and language rich. It is reflective of teachers’ respect for the languages and cultures of the families. Many children comfortably use their home languages at kindergarten. Teachers who speak languages other than English are encouraged to use their language skills to support this sense of belonging. Teachers have reviewed kindergarten documentation to invite more response from parents. These strategies have the potential to strengthen parent and whānau engagement in collaborative partnerships.</p><p>Displays and children’s learning portfolios are vibrant and attractive. Children and their families contribute to centre displays and their input is becoming increasingly evident in children’s learning records. Learning stories highlight children’s participation in the programme. Teachers now need to build on this information to show the progression of children’s learning and how they respond to children’s interests.</p><p>The programme is strongly reflective of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers incorporate literacy, languages and learning through interaction with people, places and things. Teachers are committed to growing their capacity to implement te reo Māori through a bicultural curriculum. A next step for teachers is to review how effectively the programme enables children to become confident and competent leaders of their learning.</p><p>Teachers provide good support for children’s transition to school. They have developed a closer relationship with the adjacent school. This has led to participation in school events and the establishment of preschool visits. The display of information about local schools and photos of children who have left kindergarten to attend these schools is a useful tool in supporting children’s transition.</p><p>Auckland Kindergarten Association systems for monitoring and promoting improvement in kindergarten operations are well established. A variety of useful systems and processes contribute to the teaching team’s self review. The new team are developing a shared understanding of self review. Teachers have worked collaboratively with the education specialist to review the kindergarten vision, philosophy, policies and annual plan. This has enabled the team to consider how their teaching practice and programme matches the kindergarten philosophy.</p><p>Teachers have a wealth of evidence about what they do and what they know about their children. They should strengthen their response to this information so that it leads to improved outcomes for children. The impact of changes made as a result of self review should be monitored over time to improve sustainability. Teachers agree that their priority is continuing to review the KDM to ensure positive outcomes for children. Teachers should continue to work with external support to enable the team to develop a shared understanding of meaningful evaluative self review and to strengthen their reflective practice.</p><p>Centre operations are also guided by clear future planning and a shared vision that links to the AKA’s plan. The Association has a strong commitment to biculturalism and to embracing diversity. There are sound systems in place for health, safety and accountability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The kindergarten’s priorities for development include working with external professional support to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen leadership capacity</li>
<li>develop shared understanding and collaborative team practices</li>
<li>strengthen teachers’ reflective practice and evaluative self review that leads to improved outcomes for children</li>
<li>further support children to become capable and confident leaders of their learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wesley Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Wesley Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell <br>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
