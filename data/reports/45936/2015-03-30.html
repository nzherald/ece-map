</table><p>Bula Centre requires further development in the areas of governance, self-review and curriculum to help managers and teachers promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bula Centre in Mangere East was established in 2012. It is the only Fijian community early childhood centre in New Zealand. The centre provides full-day and part-time education and care for children up to five years of age. Currently there are 18 children on the roll including two children under two. Most children are Fijian and others are Tongan or Cook Island Māori. This is the first ERO review of Bula Centre.</p><p>The service is governed by the Fijian Community Association of Auckland (FCAA). This board is elected by its Fijian community. A management committee, consisting of FCAA members and centre parents was established in 2014. The management committee reports to the FCAA board and is responsible for strategic decision making, including policy development and the financial management of the centre. An interim manager is responsible for the daily management of the service. An acting supervisor leads a team of three qualified and registered teachers. All of the teachers have been employed within the past two years.</p><p>Bula Centre aims to meet the aspirations of its Fijian community and help to preserve the Fijian language, culture and identity. The philosophy is based on the concept of a bure, promoting the interconnected roles that parents, teachers and the environment play in educating and caring for children.</p><p>Since November 2014, the management committee and teachers have undertaken professional development provided by the Ministry of Education to improve the quality of self review and curriculum practices. A strategic plan and self-review systems have been established. Teachers have begun to develop shared understandings of programme planning, assessment and evaluation requirements.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>There is a settled, positive tone in the centre. Children experience a programme that integrates the Fijian language and culture with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. They are independent learners who explore and know the centre routines. Children develop social relationships with others and spend time in focused activities of their choice.</p><p>Teachers’ interactions with children are respectful and caring. Their conversations acknowledge children’s interests and show that teachers know children and their families well. Teachers ask good questions to promote children’s thinking. They make suggestions to encourage children to try new experiences. Teachers have recently purchased equipment to further challenge children’s learning. They should continue to improve the quality and quantity of resources available to children. Teachers could also review how well mat-time experiences engage and extend older children.</p><p>Whole team professional development has supported teachers to increase their understanding of programme planning and assessment systems. Children’s interests and participation in activities are recorded in individual portfolios. Teachers identify the learning that happens in children’s play. Time is now needed for teachers to consolidate their new learning and embed shared curriculum approaches. Areas for teachers to improve include:</p><ul>
<li>planning a programme to extend children’s learning, instead of planning activities</li>
<li>linking assessment narratives and following up on identified next learning steps to show children’s progress over time</li>
<li>making use of information provided by parents about children and their aspirations for their child’s learning</li>
<li>evaluating the impact of the programme and teaching practices on improved outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are committed to building a professional team culture and improving their teaching practice. The management committee recognises that to support this, teachers should undertake an annual performance appraisal. Two teachers, who are provisionally registered, would benefit from participating in a two-year advice and guidance programme for teachers new to the profession. The interim manager has indicated he will seek an external advisor to complete these requirements.</p><p>Teachers and the recently established management committee have participated in professional development to learn how self review supports progress. The committee have developed a long-term plan to guide and measure improvements to centre operations. Important priorities for the management committee are to now:</p><ul>
<li>develop a governance manual and code of conduct to guide committee systems and practices and to ensure the centre is meeting its legal requirements</li>
<li>write a strategic goal to help the committee evaluate the effectiveness of governance practices</li>
<li>review how well the centre philosophy is enacted in practice by the management committee and all staff</li>
<li>formalise who has responsibility for the daily management of the centre when the interim manager is offsite.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The management committee agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to improve the quality of planning, assessment and evaluation of children’s learning</li>
<li>the completion of teacher appraisal processes and provision of advice and guidance programmes for teachers</li>
<li>documenting self review of educational and governance improvements</li>
<li>further development and review of governance systems and practices to guide effective centre operations.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bula Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum, self review and governance. The service provider must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>the service curriculum is informed by assessment, planning and evaluation of children’s learning</li>
<li>information about Ministry of Education funding, including the use of equity funding is reported to parents</li>
<li>a process of self review helps the service improve the quality of education and care</li>
<li>effective human resource management practices are implemented.</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C2, GMA3, GMA6, GMA7.</em></p><p>ERO also identified areas of non-compliance relating to health and safety. The service provider must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>softfall surfaces meet the requirements of New Zealand’s playground safety standards</li>
<li>a Protected Disclosure statement is added to the Child Protection Policy</li>
<li>fire drills are regularly completed and recorded</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, PF3, HS3, HS8.</em></p><p>To improve current practices, the service provider should:</p><ul>
<li>ensure a record of complaints and subsequent investigations are documented and maintained on the premises</li>
<li>review how well centre practices reflect Human Rights and Privacy policies.</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Bula Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>30 March 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
