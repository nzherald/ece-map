</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Dinsdale is located in the Frankton suburb of Hamilton. It is a full-day education and care service, licensed for 90 children with a maximum of 34 up to two years of age. The current roll of 126 includes 44 Māori children. The service has three separate learning areas that cater for the different ages and stages of infants, toddlers and young children.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2015 the governing organisation has changed its name from Kidicorp to BestStart Education and Care and has become a not-for-profit organisation. A professional service manager and business manager provide support for the centre. The centre operates under the Central North Island Waikato regional management team within BestStart.</p><p>The centre leadership structure includes a centre manager who oversees the day-to-day operations of the service with support from a team leader and head teacher. The centre philosophy has a focus on providing inclusive practices that celebrate and respect children's diversity and culture. Teachers believe parents and whānau are integral to the success of children's learning and focus on developing and maintaining professional relationships to promote the learning and wellbeing of children.</p><p>The centre has a positive ERO reporting history. Since the last ERO review in March 2016 a new centre manager has been internally appointed, along with new team leaders. There has also been changes to teaching staff, including a whole new teaching team in the older age-group room.</p><p>Developments since the last ERO review relate to teachers strengthening assessment and planning processes and increased parent and child input into the internal evaluation process. Leaders and teachers have also established community and iwi relationships to support the bicultural programme.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the BestStart organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the centre. They enjoy positive, trusting and respectful relationships with centre leaders and teachers. A culture that promotes whānaungatanga values underpins the centre culture. Children develop strong friendships with one another and are supported to develop their social and communication skills. Transitions into, between rooms and on to school are personalised to meet the emotional wellbeing of children and their families. Children's sense of belonging and wellbeing is successfully nurtured.</p><p>Children experience a rich curriculum. A strength is the use of the local community which provides meaningful learning experiences, includes regular visits to Hemi Tapu Marae, the local library and schools and bush walks. Te reo and tikanga Māori are regularly implemented and have been improved through internal evaluation. Teachers have recognised the need to continue developing practices to positively promote Māori children’s language, culture and identity.</p><p>Particular strengths of the age group areas are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the natural integration of literacy, mathematics and science into interests and play for young children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the opportunities that toddlers have for active physical challenge and sensory exploration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>respectful care interactions and personalised care rhythms that are responsive to infants individual needs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children often revisit prior experiences and engage in sustained and complex learning. Teachers are skilled at noticing, recognising and responding with intentional teaching strategies to extend children's thinking and encourage problem solving. Self help and independence is encouraged. Children receive ongoing positive encouragement and affirmation from teachers for their successes and efforts. They are well supported to view themselves as capable learners and their self confidence is fostered.</p><p>Teachers successfully work in partnership with parents. Children’s individual goals are developed in collaboration with parents and inform teachers' planning. Those children who require additional learning support have individual education plans in place. Children from all cultures have their identity acknowledged and valued through cultural celebrations and sharing significant cultural events. Teachers value the first languages of children and families at the centre. They are learning and beginning to use basics words and greetings of Tongan and Samoan cultures.</p><p>BestStart's vison is to make a positive difference in the lives of children. Governance and management have developed clear strategic goals with guidelines and expectations for centre practice and curriculum. Regional leadership and management support centre leaders and teachers to enact the vision and goals of the service. There are comprehensive, well-established systems and practices that enable the organisation to monitor, evaluate and plan for improvement across the organisation.</p><p>Centre leadership effectively leads internal evaluation practice. Centre goals for improvement align with BestStart's strategic values for its centres. Annual goals are focused on improvements to centre operations, teaching practice and outcomes for children. The centre's goals focus on assessment, and implementing te ao Māori within the programme. Teachers reflect on their practices and inquiries align to BestStart strategic goals and vision.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to develop the bicultural curriculum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment practices to include individual children's language, culture and identity, particularly for Māori children</p>
</li>
<li>develop a strategic approach to implementing <em>Te Whāriki,</em> early childhood curriculum.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Dinsdale completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Dinsdale will be in three years.</p><p>Adrienne Fowler</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>22 August 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
