</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Silverstream Kindergarten is located in Silverstream, Upper Hutt and caters for up to 50 children aged from two to five years. It is a sessional service operating on an all-day licence. At the time of this review the diverse roll of 93 children included nine who identify as Māori and three as Pacific.</p><p>The teaching team comprises a head teacher and five fully qualified teachers. They have worked together for three years. The philosophy emphasises the importance of respectful partnerships with families and whānau to enhance children's learning.</p><p>The Rimutaka Kindergarten Association (the association) governs the kindergarten effectively and provides senior teacher support. It is committed to maintaining 100% of teachers being qualified. Well-developed policy guidelines clearly outline association expectations for developing the programme and managing day-to-day operation.</p><p>The association coordinates the Upper Hutt Professional Learning Community (UPLC) cluster. This focuses on teachers from both the early childhood and primary sectors meeting regularly to support positive transitions to school for children. Silverstream Kindergarten is part of this cluster.</p><p>The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO. Areas for improvement from the April 2010 ERO report have been considered and thoughtfully responded to.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eleven kindergarten reviews in the Rimutaka Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten philosophy, vision, and values are highly evident in practice. The curriculum is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and is responsive to children's emerging interests and strengths. While these are noted in records of daily programme discussions, they could be better documented in planning meetings to provide a thread of ongoing programme responses.</p><p>There is a strong focus on building relationships with children and their families. Parent aspirations are sought and considered. Parents are part of the daily sessions. Many stay on to play alongside their own and other children.</p><p>Portfolios are well presented and provide a good record of children's involvement. Teachers are encouraging children to make decisions about what will be entered and their parents to contribute their own perspectives.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation practice has developed. Teachers are making connections between their observations of children and identifying possible learning steps. Consistency across teachers would be helped through documenting shared expectations of practice.</p><p>Teachers are welcoming and respectful. They maintain sensitive and responsive relationships with children to foster their emotional wellbeing. They support children to interact positively with others, to be a good friend and a leader. Teachers' response to children with identified learning needs is inclusive.</p><p>Children’s contributions are valued. Teachers take time to listen. They provide models of good language use and work with children to enrich their vocabularies. They play alongside children, talking through the activity, questioning and making links to children's home life and previous learning experiences.</p><p>Activity areas are well resourced for children's choices. The environment caters for their exploration, physical development and challenge. Children can access and set up equipment according to their interests. Children lead their own learning, frequently assisting and teaching skills to their peers. Play is busy and purposeful, with children choosing to play independently or cooperatively.</p><p>Children and whānau are well informed about and supported in their transition to school. Literacy and numeracy skills are taught naturally as opportunities arise.</p><p>The teaching team is developing a sound bicultural programme for children to learn about te ao Māori. The next step is to integrate more te reo me ngā tikanga Māori across sessions. As yet, the kindergarten has not specifically consulted with whānau to find out their aspirations for their children's success and to agree how their cultural identity should be upheld.</p><p>Pacific and other cultures represented on the roll are not well acknowledged in the environment. Teachers suggest they could improve this by using the languages of the children and displaying culturally appropriate artefacts.</p><p>The head teacher is an effective leader who encourages others to learn and grow professionally. Development goals are linked to undertaking leadership and incorporated in appraisal. This process affirms good practice and identifies teacher’s next steps for development. The head teacher's support is supplemented with advice and guidance from the association's senior teachers who promote regular professional development and systems that focus on fostering outcomes for children.</p><p>Progress toward strategic and annual goals is monitored through processes for self review. Evaluation of effectiveness is likely to be more focused with the use of agreed measures of success.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the teaching team agree that next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to improve the quality of assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>developing specific and measurable indicators to assist self review</li>
<li>integrating more te reo me ngā tikanga Māori across sessions</li>
<li>defining what success for Māori as Māori means in this environment</li>
<li>developing strategies to promote success for Pacific children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Silverstream Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Silverstream Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>22 October 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
