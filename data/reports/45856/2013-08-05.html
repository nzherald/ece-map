</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Coatesville Learning Centre opened in February 2012 and is purpose built to serve a rural village community. This is the first ERO report for the centre. The centre is licensed for 50 children, including up to 20 children under two years of age. Children are grouped according to age in two separate rooms. Outdoor playing spaces lead out from each of the rooms and have been purposely developed to create a natural environment. The centre provides both sessional and full day care.</p><p><em>Te Whāriki</em>The centre philosophy is strongly based on the principles and goals of, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. It clearly outlines aspirational goals to guide teachers’ practices and relationships. Teachers have made a good start in consulting with parents to help ensure these goals are being well met in the programme. Teachers work well together, using a collaborative approach to leadership.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and highly engaged in the learning programme. They make choices about their participation and enjoy the positive and caring relationships they share with teachers and other children. Teacher practices with children are thoughtful and affirming. Reciprocal conversations between teachers and children are meaningful and encourage children to share their ideas.</p><p>Communication between the centre and parents is frequent. Some parents regularly contribute family information to children’s portfolios which strengthens teacher knowledge of children’s home lives. Children enjoy revisiting their centre experiences through photographs and books created for them.</p><p>Children have good opportunities to choose from a wide range of high quality resources. Teachers effectively support children’s independent exploration and children often sustain their interest in activities for long periods of time. The centre environment is light, spacious, and provides children with access to a natural environment with equipment designed to stimulate and challenge their learning. Children are surrounded by animals and gardens that connect them to the centre’s rural setting.</p><p>Teachers are confident practitioners. Teamwork and recognition of strengths within the team adds to the quality of their professional practice. They are responsive to children’s interests and focus on prompting positive outcomes for children. Teachers continue to refine planning and assessment processes. The manager closely monitors assessment and supports teachers to embed new ways of working.</p><p>Teachers have made a good start to developing bicultural aspects in their practice, including te reo me nga tikanga Māori. They have identified the need to continue the development of this aspect of their practice.</p><p>Management of the centre is thoughtful and efficient. Self-review processes help ensure that policies and procedures are current and that teaching practice is effective. Managers take deliberate steps to grow teacher capacity as leaders of learning. Teachers take collective responsibility for professional development, as identified through appraisal. The team culture of the centre is very conducive to continued improvement for the care and education of children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre management agree that the next step for the centre is to continue to strengthen strategic planning processes. This should provide a clearer framework for teachers to strengthen self-review processes and evaluate the effectiveness of programmes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Coatesville Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Coatesville Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>5 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category.
