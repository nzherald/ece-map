<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Hokitika is located in the West Coast rural township of Hokitika. The unique, purpose-built kindergarten has been operating for many years in the community. The experienced and qualified teaching team work effectively to cater for the learning and well-being of up to 30 children over two years of age.</p><p>The kindergarten is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates a management layer in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who works in partnership with teachers providing ongoing educational leadership and professional development.</p><p>Positive features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>collaborative relationships that teachers foster with parents and wh&#257;nau that support learning and bicultural understandings</li>
<li>established partnerships that encourage parents and wh&#257;nau to play an active part in the programme</li>
<li>the way teachers involve children in decision making that extends their thinking and reasoning skills</li>
<li>richly resourced and purposefully presented learning areas that capture children&rsquo;s curiosity and encourage investigation and exploration</li>
<li>the way that children&rsquo;s interests are valued and made visible in attractive and informative wall displays and individual profile books.</li>
</ul><p>Children have many opportunities to develop their understandings of the dual heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand in ways that are meaningful and respectful of the M&#257;ori culture.</p><p>Teachers are highly reflective and have high expectations of themselves and children&rsquo;s learning. They use effective ways to continually improve teaching approaches and learning outcomes for children. Teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps are to refine and consolidate recent initiatives in assessment, planning and the evaluation of children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Hokitika was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergartens Hokitika.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and teachers.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The teaching team has recently reviewed the vision for the kindergarten. It states that teachers will provide a kindergarten that promotes a community of learners in a rich learning environment that celebrates and respects diversity.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Teachers foster a welcoming and inclusive culture. They model care and respect for one another, for children and for parents and wh&#257;nau. Teachers have effective ways of promoting partnerships with parents. They make good use of these partnerships to strengthen children&rsquo;s learning. Parent involvement in the programme is strongly encouraged and highly valued by teachers. Teachers have established good links with the community. Visitors come to the kindergarten and children make regular visits into the community to enrich the learning programme.</p><p>Teachers respond effectively to the individual and group needs and interests of children. They provide sensitive and responsive support for children&rsquo;s well-being and are actively involved in children&rsquo;s play. Children play well together, share ideas and develop friendships.</p><p>Children are interested and active participants in a child-centred learning programme. Teachers provide effective support to develop children&rsquo;s speaking and listening skills. Children are included in decision-making. These opportunities help to develop their thinking and reasoning skills. Teachers value children&rsquo;s ideas and encourage them to explore and make discoveries. Teachers affirm children&rsquo;s efforts and celebrate their successes.</p><p>Children take responsibility for themselves and the environment, and care for others. They are actively involved in the natural and spacious learning areas. These areas provide a range of opportunities for children to learn about the natural world and sustainable practices. ERO observed children enjoying a wide a range of literacy, creative and physical play.</p><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s inclusive bicultural environment supports relationships with M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau. Teachers foster children&rsquo;s cultural identity and language. Children have many opportunities to develop their understandings of the dual heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand in ways that are meaningful and respectful of the M&#257;ori culture.</p><p>Well-presented profile books and wall displays inform parents and wh&#257;nau about children&rsquo;s interests and learning in the programme.</p><p>The attractive and purposefully presented learning areas capture children&rsquo;s curiosity and encourage investigation and exploration. Children have easy access to a wide range of experiences that engage their interest in learning.</p><p>Teachers are highly reflective and have high expectations of their practices and children&rsquo;s learning. They have a shared understanding of the kindergarten&rsquo;s vision. Teachers communicate well and work effectively as a team. They make good use of professional development to continually improve the programme and practices. They place a strong focus on incorporating tikanga M&#257;ori.</p><h4>Area for development and review</h4><p>The teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that they need to refine and consolidate new initiatives in assessment and programme planning and evaluation.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Hokitika completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the kindergarten&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-hokitika" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Hokitika</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kidsfirst Kindergartens Hokitika.</p><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Hokitika is located in the West Coast rural township of Hokitika. The unique, purpose-built kindergarten has been operating for many years in the community. The experienced and qualified teaching team work effectively to cater for the learning and well-being of up to 30 children over two years of age.</p><p>The kindergarten is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates a management layer in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who works in partnership with teachers providing ongoing educational leadership and professional development.</p><p>Positive features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>collaborative relationships that teachers foster with parents and wh&#257;nau that support learning and bicultural understandings</li>
<li>established partnerships that encourage parents and wh&#257;nau to play an active part in the programme</li>
<li>the way teachers involve children in decision making that extends their thinking and reasoning skills</li>
<li>richly resourced and purposefully presented learning areas that capture children&rsquo;s curiosity and encourage investigation and exploration</li>
<li>the way that children&rsquo;s interests are valued and made visible in attractive and informative wall displays and individual profile books.</li>
</ul><p>Children have many opportunities to develop their understandings of the dual heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand in ways that are meaningful and respectful of the M&#257;ori culture.</p><p>Teachers are highly reflective and have high expectations of themselves and children&rsquo;s learning. They use effective ways to continually improve teaching approaches and learning outcomes for children. Teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps are to refine and consolidate recent initiatives in assessment, planning and the evaluation of children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the kindergarten or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a kindergarten, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirement</strong>s &ndash; assurance that this kindergarten has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of kindergarten&rsquo;s performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a kindergarten is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
