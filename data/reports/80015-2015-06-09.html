</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Montessori Children’s House provides full-day education and care for children from the age of one until they go to school. The service is licensed for 56 children. Children under two have their own room and garden, while there are two separate rooms for the older children.</p><p>All of the eight teachers are qualified. Five of these also have a Montessori qualification. Some are working towards gaining additional qualifications based on the Montessori programme and philosophy. Key to the philosophy is the belief in providing support for children to gain life skills and to develop independence and respect for people, places and things.</p><p>The centre is owned by a charitable trust governed by a board. The managing teacher is responsible for the day-to-day running of the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers provide an environment that supports children’s learning. They have established routines and expectations for children’s behaviour that help create a calm environment for learning. Children can choose from a range of accessible, good quality resources and activities and are given time to explore and complete tasks that attract their interest. The resources and activities are designed to promote specific learning through real-life experiences and include literacy and mathematics learning.</p><p>Children under the age of two enjoy warm relationships with their teachers who focus on their learning and wellbeing. They support children to be independent and foster respectful interactions. Teachers have good relationships with parents. They cooperate well to settle the children quickly when they arrive each day.</p><p>The teachers working in the three classrooms support children in many ways that reflect the Montessori programme and philosophy. They encourage and model:</p><ul>
<li>respect for each other and the environment</li>
<li>independence and problem solving</li>
<li>taking responsibility for your own learning when working alone or cooperatively with others.</li>
</ul><p>The opportunity for children to learn in a calm and respectful way also extends to learning in the centre’s attractive outdoor garden and through excursions around the local area.</p><p>Teachers use a variety of ways to share information with the children’s families and to gather parents’ aspirations for their children. The next step is to show more clearly how these are incorporated into the programme.</p><p>Teachers have a clear sense of purpose around the learning intentions connected to the Montessori values. There is an opportunity now for the teachers to strengthen the programme by:</p><ul>
<li>being clearer about learning priorities for individual children</li>
<li>deepening the analysis of children’s learning by making greater use of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum</li>
<li>evaluating the effectiveness of the teaching strategies being used.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers use some te reo Māori and waiata with children and some greetings and phrases in other languages as part of the programme. They acknowledge that they need to take a planned approach to building te reo Māori and to incorporating Māori perspectives into the daily programme. Teachers could also look for further ways to maintain children’s connections to their own cultural identity and reflect this better in children’s profile books.</p><p>The managing teacher is committed to continuously improving the service and teaching practices. She takes a collaborative approach to leadership across the service. She is establishing systems that encourage the teachers to take on leadership responsibilities. The managing teacher has a good understanding of self review and has developed a useful and thorough process. The next step is to improve the focus of reviews on finding out how practices impact on the children. This includes reviewing the quality of interactions and the effectiveness of teaching practice.</p><p>The board of trustees and the managing teacher have guided the development of the centre’s strategic vision following a wide consultation process. The next step is for the board to develop the action plan to show how the strategic plan goals will be implemented and progress monitored over time.</p><h3>Key next step</h3><p>The key next steps are to strengthen the quality of the centre’s programmes and practices as stated above.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Montessori Children's House, Wanaka completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Montessori Children's House, Wanaka will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>9 June 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
