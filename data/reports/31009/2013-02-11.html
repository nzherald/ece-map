<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>This playcentre is well placed to continue promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Puahue Playcentre is a parent-led centre. It provides education and care for families in Puahue, near Te Awamutu. The centre operates two morning sessions a week for children from birth up to school age. A third session, for children three years of age and older, is supported by an experienced playcentre person. Members continue to maintain strong links with the adjacent school. Their philosophy is that children learn best through play, supported by their families.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of the King Country Playcentre Association. Members receive valuable, ongoing, administrative and educational support from experienced and knowledgeable association personnel, including the centre support team, property manager and kaiawhina.</p><p>The previous ERO report acknowledged the centre&rsquo;s inclusive and welcoming culture, and the strong emphasis on learning through uninterrupted play and exploration. Since that report members have created an area for infants and have benefited from professional learning on planning, assessment and biculturalism.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in ten early childhood education services within the King Country Playcentre Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Children benefit from respectful, trusting and affirming relationships with adults and children. Each child is well known by all parents who share a collective approach to their care and learning. Children confidently initiate their own learning, make decisions and participate in sustained, fun filled and meaningful learning. They are encouraged to be creative, capable and confident learners and communicators.</p><p>Parents provide a high quality learning environment that encourages active exploration. They integrate literacy, numeracy and scientific concepts into children&rsquo;s play. Members focus on the holistic development of each child, skilfully fostering the development of social skills and oral language. They are highly responsive to the needs and interests of each child. Parents share ideas, contribute to session planning and evaluation, and model effective strategies that challenge thinking and extend children&rsquo;s learning through play.</p><p>The playcentre is well led and effectively managed by a group of dedicated parents. Parent members value the friendships they form and social support network that playcentre provides. They work well as a team and ensure that each member&rsquo;s particular strengths are encouraged, valued and used. Experienced members strongly encourage new parents to take on leadership roles within the centre and to undertake professional development and training. This supports parents to become more knowledgeable and confident in their role as first educators of their children.</p><h3>Agreed areas for development and review</h3><p>ERO agrees with centre priorities to further strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>self review and annual planning</li>
<li>participation in assessment and planning processes</li>
<li>use of te reo M&#257;ori with the children.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Puahue Playcentre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>11 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
