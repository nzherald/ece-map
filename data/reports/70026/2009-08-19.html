It also identified a number of areas for improvement.</p><p>This report outlines the progress the centre has made in addressing these areas. They include adult and child interactions, the learning environment, developing a bicultural perspective, assessment planning and evaluation, and a range of areas requiring improvement to health and safety procedures and practices.</p><p>Parents continue to support each other well. They have a good understanding of their roles and responsibilities and work cooperatively to ensure that the centre runs smoothly.

Parents are aware of the importance of evaluating learning and identifying next learning steps for each child. Their next step is to develop a process for gathering and using information from a variety of sources to help them evaluate the progress children are making in their learning. This includes using learning stories, the daily reflections of parents and the outcomes of self review. This information could also help the supervisor to further develop a process for programme planning.

Findings</h2><h3>Adult and Child Interactions</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2008 ERO report identified the need for adults to develop a clear and shared understanding of their role in supporting children’s play during the session. Many parents were not effectively engaging with children in ways that would support and further develop their learning.</p><h4>Areas of progress</h4><ul>
<li><em>Parents supporting each other.</em> The centre parents are very supportive of each other and their children. Roles and responsibilities of parents have been clarified. Communication between them is clear, supportive and caring. Parents make sure that each person contributes to caring for and maintaining the centre. Centre responsibilities are allocated and there is a good level of accountability. Parents support each other through the sharing of information about their parenting role.</li>
<li>Ad<em>ults responding to children.</em> Adults notice children’s play and respond with support and encouragement. The high ratio of parent-to-child makes it possible for frequent interactions between adults and children. Parents talk to children about their activities and often show them ways of using equipment and materials. They follow children’s interests and encourage cooperative play.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for further improvement</h4><ul>
<li><em>Extending interactions with children to foster learning.</em> Parents do not always interact with children in ways that foster further thinking and learning. Children engage well in activities. However, some parent-child interactions were short and did not help children to extend their thinking and learning. The next step for parents is to improve their discussion and questioning skills so that children are encouraged to explore, experiment and create more, and engage in imaginative play when appropriate.</li>
<li><em>Promoting children’s oral language.</em> Parents are providing good role models for children’s oral language. However, they do not always take time to give children the opportunity to talk, discuss and ask questions. Further training through Playcentre training courses would give parents help in developing these skills and to evaluate the beneficial effect they could have on children’s language development.</li>
</ul><h3>The Learning Environment</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The poor quality of resources was an area for improvement in the 2008 ERO review. Puzzles and toys were in poor repair. There was a limited range of resources for babies. Children did not always have easy access to equipment.</p><h4>Area of progress</h4><ul>
<li>
<p><em>The learning environment.</em> Children and their parents learn and play in a spacious well-resourced physical environment. Parents have made good progress in reviewing and refurbishing the inside environment to better meet children’s learning needs. They have repainted the inside area in a colour to enhance wall displays. New notice boards now display information for parents, the centre philosophy, and explanations of Te Whāriki, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum. Examples of assessments model good practice for parents. The play areas are clearly set out and better organised to allow easy access for children. Children now have new lockers for their lunch boxes and profile books. Resources and equipment are in the process of being upgraded. The outside area continues to be a well-maintained and well resourced area. A gate and new fencing have been built. Children enjoy opportunities to climb, ride bikes, play in the sandpit and use their carpentry skills. Parents are considering further landscaping in one outside area.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Bicultural Perspective</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The centre did not have a statement of practice, as required by their association, that demonstrates how bicultural practices should be incorporated into the programme. The centre environment did not reflect the bicultural nature of New Zealand. Parents did not feel confident in using te reo Mäori.</p><h4>Area of progress</h4><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Initiatives.</em> The centre is making progress in implementing the association’s expectations for reflecting a bicultural perspective. Te reo Mäori is frequently used for greetings, songs and instructions. Children’s profile books also use te reo Mäori headings.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>Area for further improvement</h4><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Developing parent confidence.</em> Parents need further support to improve their confidence in te reo and tikanga Mäori. The coordinator uses te reo Mäori and encourages parents to do so. Further initiatives and support should help parents feel more competent and confident using the language.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Assessment, Planning and Evaluation</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>At the time of the 2008 ERO review, planning, assessment and evaluation practices were not recognising and supporting the needs of individual children. Profile books were of poor quality. Programme planning was not clearly linked to children’s interests and learning needs. Programmes were not being evaluated.</p><h4>Area of progress</h4><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Learning stories.</em> Parents have improved the quality of the learning stories they write to support children’s ongoing learning. They are now focussing more on the learning that is happening during activities. Some parents can identify next steps for learning. As a result, children’s individual needs can be responded to and future learning opportunities planned. While there has been good progress in improving learning stories, there is need for further development. The training opportunities available to parents are an important process in helping them to understand and effectively use learning stories to guide and support their children’s learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for further improvement</h4><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Evaluation of learning.</em> The parents have yet to develop a shared process for recognising and evaluating children’s learning and identifying next learning steps. They record some evidence in individual learning stories. Some parents complete an evaluation form at the end of a session. It is not clear how findings from self review are used to evaluate the programme. The next step is for parents to identify the evidence they need to evaluate the effectiveness of the programme in improving learning, and where they will find that evidence. This can then be used as the basis for further programme improvements to meet the needs of children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Programme planning process.</em> Parents do not have an agreed process for programme planning. There are insufficient written guidelines that will help parents effectively identify and share information that will be used to plan each day’s programme. It is difficult for parents to gain a shared understanding at the beginning of a session of what will happen and how they can best support all children. Some parents are aware of the need for all parents to have a shared and consistent approach and plan to share ideas and improve this process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Health and Safety</h3><p>The areas of non-compliance related to health and safety requirements identified in the 2008 ERO review have been addressed.</p><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2><p>ERO recommends that:</p><ol>
<li>the supervisor and parents extend their interactions with children to improve children’s thinking, learning and creativity;</li>
<li>the supervisor and parents develop shared understanding of processes for evaluating children’s learning and planning programmes to meet children’s learning needs; and</li>
<li>parents are supported to improve their understanding and use of te reo and tikanga Mäori.</li>
</ol><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p align="left">Dr Graham Stoop<br><b>CHIEF REVIEW OFFICER</b></p>
