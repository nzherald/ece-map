<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p>Blue Frog Early Childhood Centre is located in Blockhouse Bay and provides education and care for sixty one children aged three months to five years. The centre opened in 2010 and since that time the experienced manager has recruited a qualified teaching team and developed good quality systems to guide centre operations. This is the first ERO review for the centre.</p>
<p>Teachers provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for children and their families. Parents report that they feel highly satisfied with the education and care that their children receive. They appreciate the information teachers share with them about their child&rsquo;s learning and the range of information and photos displayed around the centre. These good displays make learning information more available to parents and children enabling them to share and celebrate progress at the centre.</p>
<p>Relationships between adults and children are warm and caring. Infants and toddlers are well cared for in a calm nurturing environment. Teachers prepare well organised play spaces to support children&rsquo;s self-initiated play. They also work closely alongside children assisting them to settle well and engage in learning that interests them.</p>
<p>Children are articulate communicators. They express their ideas with confidence and invite others to collaborate in their play. Many children can write their names and enjoy using Information Communication Technologies to enhance their literacy and number knowledge. Children enjoy story and music sessions. Two and three year olds regularly contribute their preferences and ideas during these group times.</p>
<p>Teachers have developed useful systems for recording children&rsquo;s learning and regularly discuss and prepare plans to extend centre topics. They increasingly notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s learning in meaningful ways. The centre manager and staff have developed goals to enhance the partnerships they have with parents and wh&#257;nau so that children&rsquo;s learning plans are further strengthened.</p>
<p>Children benefit from managers and teachers&rsquo; commitment to professional learning and their proactive approach to improving programmes. Managers plan to encourage more critical reflection and discussion in self review and teacher appraisal processes. ERO recommends that teachers more consistently support and extend children&rsquo;s interests and learning in the context of play and develop more confidence using te reo M&#257;ori and reflecting New Zealand&rsquo;s dual cultural heritage in the programme.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Blue Frog Early Childhood Centre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atBlue Frog Early Childhood Centre.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p>
<ul><li>the quality of management</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Blue Frog Early Childhood Centre opened in 2010 and caters for 61 children including 20 children under the age of two in separate learning areas. The centre aims to provide a stimulating and caring environment where each child is respected as an individual. Teachers are guided by Te Wh&#257;riki, New Zealand&rsquo;s early childhood curriculum and use this as a framework for planning learning programmes for children.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>Relationships. Affirming relationships between teachers, children and families are a positive feature at this centre. Parents appreciate the friendly approach of teachers and the way that they regularly share information about children&rsquo;s learning and progress. Teachers often organise events to acknowledge and celebrate the multicultural heritage of families. Children and their parents experience an environment where they know they are welcome.</p>
<p>Programme. Children settle well into learning areas of their choosing. During periods of child-initiated play children are confident communicators and express their ideas to peers and adults. They readily initiate learning, direct and extend activities and develop negotiation and problem solving skills. Literacy and numeracy knowledge and skills are used by many children in the course of their play.</p>
<p>Team work. Teachers work effectively as a team. They have frequent and good communication with each other which helps to ensure that children&rsquo;s care needs are well met. Staff with expertise in te reo me ona tikanga M&#257;ori have the potential to build the confidence and capacity of colleagues to integrate M&#257;ori language and waiata into the daily programme and centre routines. Teacher&rsquo;s collaboration provides positive role modelling for children.</p>
<p>Environment. An attractive learning environment and well organised resources promote children&rsquo;s learning. Outdoor play areas challenge and encourage children&rsquo;s development of physical skills. Managers are committed to providing a well resourced learning environment. Children benefit from teachers&rsquo; curriculum reviews and the improvements that they make to play areas.</p>
<p>Assessment. Staff have made good progress in developing systems to document children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers present children&rsquo;s learning well in wall displays and individual portfolios. This makes children&rsquo;s engagement in play and progress increasingly accessible for families. Celebrating children&rsquo;s capabilities and achievements is a feature of this work. Centre managers have plans to involve parents and wh&#257;nau more directly in their child&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p>Management practices. Managers provide very good leadership and support for their staff. Since opening the centre a range of quality systems have been developed. These include detailed annual plans to guide centre improvements. The centre manager encourages staff to consider ways to improve their practices, using self review and appraisal systems to prompt professional reflection and discussion.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p>Centre managers have prioritised key areas for ongoing development. These include:</p>
<ul><li>continuing to work with teaching teams to enhance assessment practices by enhancing continuity between learning stories and developing better links between individual children&rsquo;s interests and daily planning</li>
<li>encouraging parents to share their goals and aspirations for their children</li>
<li>developing greater depth and critical reflection in self review and appraisal systems.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, managers and teachers could:</p>
<ul><li>consider how to more consistently support and extend children&rsquo;s interests and learning in the context of play</li>
<li>review the purpose, timing and impact of group times to ensure these do not interrupt children&rsquo;s interactions with other children and their play-based learning</li>
<li>support children&rsquo;s literacy and numeracy learning in less formal ways to ensure learning is meaningful and embedded in the context of children&rsquo;s play</li>
<li>increase teachers&rsquo; knowledge of tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori so that New Zealand&rsquo;s bi-cultural heritage is increasingly acknowledged and celebrated.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Blue Frog Early Childhood Centre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2>
<p>ERO and centre managers agree that managers and teachers should further develop self review systems so that they can readily identify areas for review and development to further improve learning outcomes for children.</p>
<a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>

<p>To the Parents and Community of Blue Frog Early Childhood Centre</p>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Blue Frog Early Childhood Centre.</p>
<p>Blue Frog Early Childhood Centre is located in Blockhouse Bay and provides education and care for sixty one children aged three months to five years. The centre opened in 2010 and since that time the experienced manager has recruited a qualified teaching team and developed good quality systems to guide centre operations. This is the first ERO review for the centre.</p>
<p>Teachers provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for children and their families. Parents report that they feel highly satisfied with the education and care that their children receive. They appreciate the information teachers share with them about their child&rsquo;s learning and the range of information and photos displayed around the centre. These good displays make learning information more available to parents and children enabling them to share and celebrate progress at the centre.</p>
<p>Relationships between adults and children are warm and caring. Infants and toddlers are well cared for in a calm nurturing environment. Teachers prepare well organised play spaces to support children&rsquo;s self-initiated play. They also work closely alongside children assisting them to settle well and engage in learning that interests them.</p>
<p>Children are articulate communicators. They express their ideas with confidence and invite others to collaborate in their play. Many children can write their names and enjoy using Information Communication Technologies to enhance their literacy and number knowledge. Children enjoy story and music sessions. Two and three year olds regularly contribute their preferences and ideas during these group times.</p>
<p>Teachers have developed useful systems for recording children&rsquo;s learning and regularly discuss and prepare plans to extend centre topics. They increasingly notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s learning in meaningful ways. The centre manager and staff have developed goals to enhance the partnerships they have with parents and wh&#257;nau so that children&rsquo;s learning plans are further strengthened.</p>
<p>Children benefit from managers and teachers&rsquo; commitment to professional learning and their proactive approach to improving programmes. Managers plan to encourage more critical reflection and discussion in self review and teacher appraisal processes. ERO recommends that teachers more consistently support and extend children&rsquo;s interests and learning in the context of play and develop more confidence using te reo M&#257;ori and reflecting New Zealand&rsquo;s dual cultural heritage in the programme.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p>
<p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
