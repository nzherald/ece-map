<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2>
<p>Childs Wonder is a privately owned early childhood service, opened in 2009. The centre is licensed under the 2008 regulatory framework. It is located in Papamoa in the eastern Bay of Plenty and provides education and care for children from birth to school age. At the time of this ERO review the roll was 51, of whom 12 were under two years of age. This is the centre&rsquo;s first review.</p>
<p>The centre owner /manager is knowledgeable about early childhood education and works collaboratively with well qualified staff to provide a high-quality service for children and their families. Her leadership approach is inclusive and fosters a culture of well-being and belonging in the centre for children and their families.</p>
<p>Teachers have developed strong self-review practices that focus on improving learning programmes for infants, toddlers and young children. Literacy and numeracy are effectively integrated throughout the programme. Children are benefiting from a purposeful programme that supports their ongoing sense of well-being, and provides experiences and opportunities that stimulate their learning and development. Management and ERO agree that the learning programme would be further enhanced by parents and children participating in aspects of the assessment practice.</p>
<p>A feature of the centre is the inclusion of the natural world where children have a range of opportunities to experience and explore the environment. This provides infants, toddlers and young children with meaningful contexts in which they can explore and care for their surroundings. High-quality interactions between children and teachers are characterised by frequent opportunities for focused one-to-one attention. Teachers support children&rsquo;s play, without interruption, for sustained periods of time. Positive and affirming relationships underpin these interactions and encourage a sense of trust between adults and children.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Childs Wonder was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atChilds Wonder.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The centre&rsquo;s shared vision and philosophy aim to provide, through a home like environment, opportunities for children to develop nurturing, responsive and respectful relationships, which allow them to pursue their natural curiosity and wonder. The importance of family/wh&#257;nau and working in partnership with parents is a priority for the service.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>Leadership: The centre owner /manager is knowledgeable about early childhood education and works collaboratively with well-qualified staff to provide a high quality service for children and their families. Teachers are well supported to access opportunities in professional development, to enhance their knowledge and understanding of current theory and practice in early childhood education. Team leaders provide strong direction for teaching and learning in their respective learning areas. Together with teachers, they undertake regular self review to gather relevant information, and use this to make decision about the programme and the strategic direction of the service. This leadership approach is inclusive and is focused on fostering a culture of well-being and belonging in the centre.</p>
<p>Learning programmes: Teachers have developed effective teaching practices that are focused on positive learning outcomes for infants, toddlers and young children. Literacy, numeracy and te ao M&#257;ori are integrated throughout the programme. Aspects of the programme that are contributing to good performance include:</p>
<ul><li>well-developed self-review practices for evaluating the learning programme and outcomes for children;</li>
<li>highly effective procedures for programme planning based on children&rsquo;s emerging interests;</li>
<li>planning books that make clear links to Te Wh&#257;riki (The Early Childhood Curriculum) and identify possible lines of development for groups and individuals;</li>
<li>extensive opportunities for children to develop their interests, skills and understandings about literacy and mathematical concepts;</li>
<li>children exploring, making choices, and experiencing challenges that increase their capabilities as learners;</li>
<li>an integration of the &lsquo;virtues&rsquo; programme, where teachers model the language and behaviours of positive relationships and resolution skills to children; and</li>
<li>teachers demonstrating an ongoing commitment to understanding te ao M&#257;ori.</li>
</ul><p>Children are benefiting from a purposeful programme that supports their ongoing sense of well-being and provides experiences and opportunities that stimulate their learning and development.</p>
<p>Learning environment: A feature of the centre is the inclusion of the natural world where children have a range of opportunities to experience and explore the environment. This provides infants, toddlers and young children with meaningful contexts in which they can explore and care for their surroundings. Children are able to move freely between indoor and outdoor areas, and enjoy accessing a wide range of resources and activities which allow them to challenge their skills and experiment in play.</p>
<p>In addition, infants have ongoing choice and access to a range of age-appropriate resources and challenges, such as sensory experiences that support their learning and development. Children benefit from opportunities to follow their own interests, set challenges and persevere in a calm and settled learning environment.</p>
<p>Relationships and interactions: High-quality interactions between children and teachers are characterised by frequent opportunities for focused one-to-one attention. Teachers support children&rsquo;s play, without interruption, for sustained periods of time. Aspects of effective interactions include:</p>
<ul><li>teachers being nurturing, gentle, responsive, highly respectful and calm when interacting with infants, toddlers and young children;</li>
<li>teachers acknowledging children&rsquo;s feelings and frustrations, moving to support them both physically and through conversations; and</li>
<li>children making decisions about their play, participation, physical needs, solving problems and enjoying opportunities to revisit learning experiences.</li>
</ul><p>Positive and affirming relationships underpin these interactions and foster a sense of trust between adults and children.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p>Management and ERO agree that the agreed priorities for ongoing development&nbsp;include continuing to:</p>
<ul><li>integrate aspects of te reo M&#257;ori into the learning programme; and</li>
<li>fully implementing the appraisal process.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3>
<p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul><li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3>
<p>Childs Wonder is a new centre and currently has one child with moderate special needs enrolled. The service has a significant number of trained and registered teachers who have sound knowledge about child development and implement an inclusive and child focused programme.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p>The centre works from the philosophy of family/wh&#257;nau partnership and places priority on transitioning children with identified needs into the service. The service liaises effectively with external support agencies and has developed individual programmes for these children in partnership with parents and teachers.</p>
<p>The learning programme is designed to empower children by allowing them choices about the activities they would like to do, giving them the daily time and space they need. This belief allows children with identified needs to settle with the ongoing support of family and teachers. The service has reviewed the learning environment to ensure it relates specifically to the interests and needs of these children. Individual child profiles reflect children&rsquo;s achievement and successes which are then shared with parents.</p>
<h3>Area for development and review</h3>
<p>The centre has identified the need to document and communicate with parents the policy, procedure and expectations that supports families&rsquo; with special needs, including transition and induction into the service.</p>
<a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Childs Wonder completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>

<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Childs Wonder.</p>
<p>Childs Wonder is a privately owned early childhood service, opened in 2009. The centre is licensed under the 2008 regulatory framework. It is located in Papamoa in the eastern Bay of Plenty and provides education and care for children from birth to school age. At the time of this ERO review the roll was 51, of whom 12 were under two years of age. This is the centre&rsquo;s first review.</p>
<p>The centre owner /manager is knowledgeable about early childhood education and works collaboratively with well qualified staff to provide a high-quality service for children and their families. Her leadership approach is inclusive and fosters a culture of well-being and belonging in the centre for children and their families.</p>
<p>Teachers have developed strong self-review practices that focus on improving learning programmes for infants, toddlers and young children. Literacy and numeracy are effectively integrated throughout the programme. Children are benefiting from a purposeful programme that supports their ongoing sense of well-being, and provides experiences and opportunities that stimulate their learning and development. Management and ERO agree that the learning programme would be further enhanced by parents and children participating in aspects of the assessment practice.</p>
<p>A feature of the centre is the inclusion of the natural world where children have a range of opportunities to experience and explore the environment. This provides infants, toddlers and young children with meaningful contexts in which they can explore and care for their surroundings. High-quality interactions between children and teachers are characterised by frequent opportunities for focused one-to-one attention. Teachers support children&rsquo;s play, without interruption, for sustained periods of time. Positive and affirming relationships underpin these interactions and encourage a sense of trust between adults and children..</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
