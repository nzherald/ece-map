</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>YMCA Early Learning Centre located in Hamilton, is licensed for 50 children including up to 16 under the age of two years. It offers all-day education and care for children from birth to school age in two separate age-based areas. Children come from a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds, including five who identify as Maori and 21 who identify as Indian. At the time of this ERO review 54 children were enrolled.</p><p>The centre is one of five early childhood services operating under the umbrella of the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA). Governance, leadership and management support is provided by personnel from the YMCA organisation. There has recently been significant changes at governance, leadership and centre levels.</p><p>The centre's philosophy states a commitment to working in partnerships with parents and whānau, recognising and celebrating different cultures and providing an environment where children are challenged and empowered to take ownership of their learning.</p><p>In July 2017 the Ministry of Education placed the centre on a provisional licence. This was upgraded to a full licence in June 2018.</p><p>The areas identified for improvement in the 2015 ERO report remain, including implementing culturally responsive practices, the impact of routines on children and enriching the environment to extend and add complexity to children’s learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre curriculum is inclusive, welcoming and invites participation of parents and whānau. The programme is a combination of child-initiated play and teacher-led activities. Individual electronic portfolios capture children’s engagement in the programme and support partnerships with parents. The centre manager is reintroducing hard copies of these valuable records to make them more accessible to children, and enable them revisit their learning. Useful individual education plans are implemented to support positive outcomes for children with additional learning and development needs.</p><p>The new teaching team is focused on developing a collaborative team approach to teaching and learning. ERO observed:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>children experiencing respectful and trusting relationships with their teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opportunities for children to develop friendships and have fun</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a responsive approach to children’s emotional wellbeing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers' use of open-ended questions affirming children’s contributions and social conversations.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from respectful and nurturing relationships that support their sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>The centre manager and the recently appointed group manager and are in the early stages of building capability within the centre to promote positive outcomes for children. Clear policy statements have been developed to guide centre operations. The centre manager and teachers have consulted with families to develop the philosophy and centre values. The organisation has yet to develop effective systems and processes to support centre leadership. Maintaining a consistent teaching team has been a challenge for leaders over the past three years.</p><p>Robust systems and processes for internal evaluation of outcomes for children have yet to be implemented.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for YMCA governance is to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop strategic goals that are focused on curriculum, teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and implement quality assurance practices to enable the board to evaluate how well the centre is meeting it's philosophy and promoting positive outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a procedure to guide effective assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the provision of resources and equipment available for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders need to build sustainable practices and capability through:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation including appraisal of staff, that is aligned to strategic goals and focused on positive outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>individualised assessment, planning and evaluation that:</p>
<ul>
<li>reflects children’s language, culture and identity</li>
<li>involves parents in goal setting</li>
<li>naturally integrates literacy and mathematics</li>
<li>shows increased complexity of children’s learning over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends the service continues to participate in Ministry of Education funded Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO) professional development to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop a collective understanding of the expectations of the revised <em>Te Whāriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and implement a localised curriculum that reflects the centre's context and the requirements of <em>Te Whāriki.</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of YMCA Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop and implement an appraisal procedure that meets the requirements of the Education Council of New Zealand.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of YMCA Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>13 December 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
