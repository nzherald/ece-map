</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Lynnmall is a well-established centre in the LynnMall shopping centre. It provides education and care for up to 73 children from infancy to school age. There are three separate areas providing for infants, toddlers and older children. The centre occupies well maintained premises with good facilities for staff and children. Core features of the centre philosophy are to provide a calm, warm inclusive environment, a commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi and a focus on the holistic development of each child</p><p>The centre is privately owned and operates under a franchise agreement with Lollipops Educare, now owned by The Evolve Education Group. The centre operates with the policy and management framework of Evolve. Personnel from Evolve provide management support and professional development for the centre owner, manager and teachers.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified good practices that have been maintained. Celebrating and responding to the diverse cultural backgrounds of the children continues to be a strength. The ERO report identified areas for development included improvements to the curriculum and self review. Since ERO’s 2013 review, staffing has remained stable and a new centre manager has recently been appointed. The centre has been refurbished inside to create flexible play spaces and the outdoor area has been redeveloped and attractively landscaped. There has been a strong focus on providing a more natural environment. Most teachers are qualified and registered and continue to be involved in professional development</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in sustained play, have fun, and are enthusiastic learners. The centre is very well resourced, print rich and has a wide variety of learning areas that invite children to investigate and explore. Natural resources are well used throughout the centre. The outside play areas are spacious and well equipped. Children's creativity and curiosity is affirmed, as is their ability to lead and join in activities, and imaginative play. Children are confident, caring and trusting with adults and other children. They play and learn at a relaxed pace in an attractive, welcoming environment.</p><p>Responsive respectful relationships between teachers and children are a strength of the centre. Sensitive and supportive teaching practices affirm and build on the strengths children bring. Teachers acknowledge children’s cultural backgrounds and encourage children’s use of home languages in greetings and conversations. Bicultural practices and the use of te reo Māori are woven through aspects of the programme. Teachers recognise the importance of continuing to strengthen their bicultural practice and increasing the use of te reo Māori throughout the programme.</p><p>Teachers understand and provide well for the special characteristics of each age group in the centre. They know the needs and aspirations of the children and their families. Children’s transitions through the centre are carefully managed. Infants benefit from nurturing, individualised care Toddlers have space and are encouraged to explore, develop independence and play with their own and older peers. Responsive teaching supports infants’ and toddlers’ need for strong and secure attachments.</p><p>Teachers plan and implement a good quality curriculum. It reflects <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, the centre philosophy and is responsive to children’s interests. Assessment and planning is displayed for adults and children to revisit. Teachers are keen to strengthen aspects of their individual planning for children. E-portfolios allow families to have instant access to information about their children’s learning. Increasingly, parents are accessing this information and contributing their ideas.</p><p>Teachers discreetly encourage children to use literacy, mathematics, and science as part of their play and promote physical activity. They affirm and support children in their learning and take advantage of opportunities to extend the complexity of play.</p><p>Teachers work effectively and collaboratively as a team. Centre leaders encourage professional development and seek additional ways to build teacher leadership capability. Better documentation of teachers' thinking around the effectiveness of their practice would contribute to strategies for the ongoing improvement in teaching and learning.</p><p>Sound management and governance systems are in place. The centre owner is actively involved in the centre and supportive of the teachers and new centre manager. She is very well supported by Evolve personnel to implement effective management systems and sound policies and procedures to guide centre operations. A strong focus on children and families and responding to community needs along with a clear shared vision underpins centre practices. Self review is established and guides decision making and continuous improvement. The owner has recently reviewed and improved the appraisal process. She is aware it could be further developed to better meet Education Council requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders and ERO agreed that self review is an area to further strengthen and that teachers could:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>more consistently document how they reflect and evaluate their teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen their bicultural knowledge and practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase the strategies that extend child-led learning and make these more visible in programme documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Lynnmall completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lollipops Educare Lynnmall will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>28 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
