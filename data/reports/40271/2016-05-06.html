</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Children at Community Kindy Parton Road participate in learning play that excites their interest, encourages exploration, and challenges and engages them in creative play. High-quality interactive nurturing relationships are evident among teachers, babies, toddlers and young children. Parents/whānau and their children are warmly welcomed each day and are well informed about centre values and share their aspirations for their children’s health and wellbeing.</p><p>The centre vision aims to provide a high quality programme that promotes curiosity and fun through open communication, partnership and quality time. Children, parents and whānau contributions are valued. A collaborative approach to centre review and development of the philosophy has involved all staff, children, parents and whānau.</p><p>There has been considerable roll growth in recent months and at the time of this ERO review, 69 children were enrolled and 21 are identified as Māori. The centre manager, head teachers and all teaching staff are new to the centre. Since the 2013 ERO's review the centre has been relicensed and undergone significant building refurbishment and reorganisation. In response to community needs, a new area for children up to two years was established in February 2016.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of BestStart Educare, which provides policy, guidelines, strategic direction, financial and business management support. Professional guidance and direction for staff is provided through, appraisal, which includes teacher inquiry and internal reviews. The centre is supported by both the business manager and professional services manager, who work collaboratively to enhance centre leadership and teacher capability. They also support the development and implementation of the centre's vision and strategic goals.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Babies and toddlers have a designated area and all children are free to move between the two areas. Teachers carefully monitor babies and toddlers to ensure that their specific needs are met and home routines are followed as much as possible. Babies and toddlers responsiveness to their brothers and sisters, as well as other children and adults is reciprocated and mutually beneficial for all.</p><p>Young children benefit from the positive relationships among teachers, parents and whānau. They are encouraged to freely play in mixed-age settings. This promotes a whānau approach, where siblings and friends play and learn together in an environment that nurtures and extends relationships with one another. These relationships are reciprocal and prioritise children's learning and wellbeing.</p><p>All children benefit from a learning environment, which stimulates their excitement and desire to learn and explore. Teachers follow their interests and encourage them to take the initiative in their own learning. Children are an important part of programme design and frequently engage in conversations about what is needed and how they might accomplish complex tasks. As a result, children have a strong sense of purpose, think for themselves and are meaningfully engaged in decisions about their own learning.</p><p>Teachers share their observations and knowledge, and together these contribute to strategies for extending children’s interests. This self-enquiry approach is contributing to the consistency of teacher questioning and interactions that engage children and parents into a wider learning network.</p><p>Teachers value the contribution of parents and whānau and encourage them to contribute their expertise and lead aspects of the programme and centre development. The 'Story Park' web-site programme provides parents with up to date knowledge about their child's development and learning in the centre.</p><p>Positive relationships with whānau from Ngā Potiki Tamapore marae contribute to children's understanding about Te Ao Māori. This approach provides a more authentic approach to the implementation of te reo and tikanga Māori practices within the centre. The kawa of Ngāi Te Rangi is better understood and teachers are increasingly promoting and integrating aspects of iwi tikanga into the daily programme.</p><p>The centre manager is a knowledgeable and effective leader of learning. Her enthusiasm and passion for the wellbeing of children and adults is contributing to a positive learning community, which benefits children. She is a highly effective leader who understands, explains and models best practice for teachers. Her distributed and shared leadership approach is based on valuing the skills and contributions of others.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To sustain and build on recent positive developments in the centre the following next steps will be important for promoting high-quality outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Consider ways to strengthen the presence of the languages, cultures and identities of individual children and their families in assessment, planning, programme and the environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing shared expectations and indicators for teaching practice to further develop the collective capabilities of the teaching team to enact the centre's vision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue to build on and embed current learning strategies to ensure positive initiatives are sustained.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Community Kindy Parton Rd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Community Kindy Parton Rd will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>6 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
