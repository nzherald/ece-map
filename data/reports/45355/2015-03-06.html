</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bizzy Kids Childcare is a privately owned centre that operates from a refurbished and modernised house in Mangere. It provides an attractive open-plan learning environment. There are separate areas for the over two year olds and the younger infants and toddlers. The centre is licensed for 35 children, including up to ten under two years of age.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy places priority on ensuring children are provided with a caring, safe environment that provides meaningful learning experiences. Centre managers provide a high ratio of adults to children. Staff have created a welcoming, family-focused centre. Parents appreciate the respectful and responsive care that staff provide. They also value the multicultural dimension of the centre and its staff.</p><p>The centre owner/managers have recently opened a second early childhood centre. This development has led to some recent staffing changes and a period of transition within the Bizzy Kids Childcare organisation. As a result, the managers are reflecting on ways to effectively support staff at both centres.</p><p>The strengths of the centre identified in the 2012 ERO report have been sustained and continue to strengthen. Findings of this 2015 review indicate that self-review processes are more robust. The centre owner/managers and staff are committed to providing high quality care and education for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed by staff. They demonstrate a strong sense of belonging in the centre. Children chat happily with their peers and adults, and enjoy opportunities throughout the day to participate in mixed age play. They particularly enjoy opportunities to make some choices in their play. During these times, children are focused and teachers are more successful at encouraging their engagement in centre activities.</p><p>Infants and toddlers receive nurturing care in a calm, unhurried environment. Staff interact happily with children and are responsive to their care needs. They provide the infants and toddlers with a good quality, well resourced learning environment.</p><p>Records of children’s time at the centre show them participating in a range of purposeful activities. Recent programme changes are however, limiting children’s choices in play. The programme is currently too routine-driven. This is reducing its capacity to respond to the needs of all children, particularly the four year olds. It would be useful for centre managers and teachers to now review the programme. They should focus on how the programme can better respond to children’s needs and interests, and better engage older children through complex play and challenge.</p><p>Staff have made good progress in establishing a bicultural curriculum. They integrate aspects of te reo me ona tikanga Māori to centre practice and the programme. Children participate keenly in waiata and powhiri. They demonstrate understanding in their use of some basic te reo Māori. These actions help embed the cultural identity of Māori children.</p><p>Teachers are well supported with professional development. Internal expertise is used well to support children with special needs. Teachers are committed to working alongside families and external agencies to meet children’s individual goals. They continue to develop reflective teaching practices. Self review looks at the centre's progress in relation to its annual plan goals and the centre’s philosophy.</p><p>Centre managers are aware that the new teaching team needs continuing support to enhance children’s creativity, exploration and thinking through self directed play. Centre managers have begun to lead the team through a self-review process. They aim to strengthen this aspect of the programme. ERO has confidence that managers can make progress the areas requiring further development.</p><p>Centre managers demonstrate a thoughtful, strategic approach to centre progress and development. There is a strong sense of shared direction and mutual respect amongst managers, staff and families. Managers have completed their qualifications. They continue to place priority on further growing teachers’ capability and professional practice. The owner/managers model professional leadership and the expectations that they have of staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers agree that the centre’s priorities are to further develop child-led learning by:</p><ul>
<li>accessing teacher professional development to improve assessment, programme planning and evaluation</li>
<li>developing the role of a centre-wide curriculum leader to support teachers to continually improve the programme.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bizzy Kids Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bizzy Kids Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>6 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
