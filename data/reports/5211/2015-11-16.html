</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Maungatapu Free Kindergarten provides both school-day and sessional education and care for children from two years to school age. At the time of this ERO review 53 children were enrolled, including eight of Māori descent. Since ERO’s last review, in April 2012, the license has been amended to reflect changes to kindergarten session times.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy expresses the aim to develop genuine relationships through manaakitanga with families, whānau and children. Teachers have developed this philosophy through in-depth self review and have recently consulted with the kindergarten’s parent community. Kindergarten resourcing and developments are well supported by an active and involved committee that is made up of kindergarten parents.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of Tauranga Regional Kindergartens (TRK), which is a not-for-profit early childhood education service, governed by a board of parent-elected community representatives. Senior Teachers oversee and support the professional work of the kindergarten. This work is supplemented by a resource teacher Māori who provides professional learning and support for TRK staff in te ao Māori.</p><p>The association sets the strategic direction of its kindergartens with emphasis on nurturing reciprocal relationships with whānau and communities, education for sustainability, meeting community needs, and honouring the Treaty of Waitangi. The TRK provides kindergarten staff with clear guidelines and expectations for practice. There is a good range of self-review practices to monitor and evaluate the quality of education and care provided by its kindergartens.</p><p>Consistent with TRK policy of only employing trained and registered teachers in regulated positions, the kindergarten is staffed by five qualified and registered teachers along with an administrator. Support for children with identified special educational needs is provided by the Ministry of Education support worker. The experienced teaching team has been in the kindergarten for many years, providing strong continuity of relationships with families and the community.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews in the Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers give high priority to developing meaningful and authentic relationships with parents and children. These relationships are based on mutual respect and trust. Through these relationships teachers develop deep knowledge of children and their families. Diversity is celebrated and teachers value the culture, identity and uniqueness of each child.</p><p>The Maungatapu Free Kindergarten curriculum is designed and implemented to promote:</p><ul>
<li>respectful and trusting relationships at all levels</li>
<li>children's emotional intelligence, being able to manage themselves, and responding to others in positive ways</li>
<li>physical development, self-set challenges and wellbeing</li>
<li>creative expression through the arts that also include pūrakau, waiata and symbols significant to Māori</li>
<li>literacy, mathematics and science</li>
<li>responsive transition to school for children and families.</li>
</ul><p>These priorities have been defined as part of the in-depth review of the kindergarten philosophy and teachers underlying beliefs about how children learn, and desired outcomes.</p><p>Teachers have developed assessment practice that builds on children’s strengths and interests. This assessment for learning takes account of parent aspirations and children’s ideas and intentions alongside teachers’ perspectives. Daily sharing among teachers enables them to identify and share children’s emerging interests, and respond in a timely way to extend children’s learning. Recently introduced computer technologies have enhanced children’s contribution to their own assessment and view of themselves as learners, and links between kindergarten, home and extended family.</p><p>Children and families benefit from transition-to-school practices that are highly responsive to individuals. Teachers have established significant and effective professional relationships with local schools. They engage in conversations with primary school colleagues about children’s dispositions, interests and learning styles. Reciprocal visits enable children and teachers to learn about one another, and for junior school teachers to be ready for children and respond to them as learners.</p><p>Teachers are skilled at noticing, recognising and responding to children’s developing literacy and mathematics skills and knowledge in the contexts of their interests, play and exploration. They pay particular attention to oral language, and intentionally model rich vocabulary associated with learning areas and children’s passions.</p><p>Children enjoy meaningful opportunities to engage in complex learning and project work, based on their interests and self determined goals. Teachers skilfully support children to design, plan and problem solve to achieve success.</p><p>Teachers value the professional leadership from the senior teacher. This leadership has been significant in facilitating the recent philosophy review and ongoing professional learning and development for teachers.</p><p>Shared leadership of the kindergarten enables all teachers to use their experience, strengths and talents to contribute to kindergarten life. Since ERO’s last review teachers have reviewed and made improvements to aspects of the daily programme and assessment practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To embed the recently reviewed kindergarten philosophy and maximise the potential of intended outcomes for children it will be important for teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop parents’ involvement in and understanding of their own children’s learning</li>
<li>identify and document shared understandings and expectations about ‘best practice’ in the context of the Maungatapu Free Kindergarten curriculum and philosophy.</li>
</ul><p>Ongoing development of the appraisal process is needed to strengthen professional critique and feedback to teachers about their practice. This development should also consider ways to more closely align strategic and annual plans, teachers’ appraisal, and self review.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Maungatapu Free Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Maungatapu Free Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
