</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>New Windsor Playcentre is a parent-cooperative service that operates adjacent to New Windsor Primary school. The centre provides five morning sessions and one afternoon session each week. Programmes for children are underpinned by the Playcentre philosophy of parents and children playing and learning together. The centre is able to cater for 30 children including 15 up to two years of age.</p><p>The centre is part of the newly established Auckland Central Playcentre Region. Regional systems support centre members to manage their centres and to provide educational programmes for their children. Playcentre personnel also provide training programmes for parents/whānau to achieve Playcentre qualifications.</p><p>Recommendations from ERO's 2015 report helped current leaders to make some strategic changes. These included strengthening bicultural practices, using children's ideas more frequently in planning and evaluation, and centre members engaging with Playcentre courses. These continue to be priorities for members in this centre.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three Playcentre reviews in the Auckland Central Playcentre Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled, confident and friendly. They respond well to the flow of the centre and the day has a calm unhurried pace. They enjoy the freedom they have to explore the space and the activities on offer. Resources are easily accessed. Long periods of uninterrupted play allow children to initiate and sustain their own learning experiences.</p><p>Children display a strong sense of belonging. They help adults and each other, share stories about home and whānau and show care, especially older children for younger and smaller children. They are supported to take learning risks and to make decisions about their play.</p><p>Sensory play is a prominent part of the programme for children under two. They are able to follow their individual sleeping and feeding patterns with opportunities for self-management skills woven into the routines and rituals of the day. Oral language and communication is fostered in various ways.</p><p>New families are warmly welcomed into the centre and a buddy adult supports their inclusion into the wider life of Playcentre. Centre members value families sharing their home languages and cultures with the children to enrich their learning.</p><p>Planning and assessment processes include using children’s portfolios to record stories about their time in the centre and to focus on the experiences they have enjoyed. Adults use evaluation meetings at the end of each session effectively. They discuss children’s learning and plan for future ways of supporting their development. Centre members could now consider ways to focus on individual children’s interests, to revisit and link stories, making progress more visible.</p><p>Parents/whānau make decisions collectively at regular meetings. The recently appointed group of office holders undertakes centre responsibilities, with many new to their roles. Centre members have developed strategic and annual planning to guide their progress. While members regularly reflect on these plans, they could rationalise their strategic plan to align better with their aspirations for children's learning.</p><p>The regional management team takes responsibility for supporting effective operations. The team is aware of the strengths and needs of each centre and provides professional leadership to promote improvement and growth. Centre support workers are guided by regional centre support coordinators. Individual and effective support helps each centre to continue to develop quality programmes for children, and sound health and safety monitoring requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to build on current good practice, the members agree that next steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening planning processes to more consistently show how children's individual interests are progressed over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing intentional bicultural practices and continuing to use, and achieve a higher level of competency in, te reo Māori.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To enhance practices in all Auckland Region Playcentres, the regional manager and support personnel should consider ways to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>better support adult education, with consideration about the timing of workshops</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide additional support to increase centre members' understanding and use of effective assessment, planning and evaluation processes, bicultural practices and internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support centres to further develop and link strategic and annual planning to create more systematic consideration of the long-term needs within their centres.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of New Windsor Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of New Windsor Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>17 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
