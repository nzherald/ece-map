</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>CAS Early Learning Centre is a privately owned centre and is licensed for 24 children. Most of the teachers are certified early childhood teachers. The licensee is a teacher and the centre manager. A new head teacher has recently been appointed.</p><p>Children aged two-to-five years attend the centre.</p><p>The building is a converted house with an open and purposeful flow between the different rooms. Each room creates a distinct space where children can find quiet areas and be undisturbed in their play. The centre is a welcoming place for children and their whānau. There is a large well-resourced outside area.</p><p>The centre has made good progress towards addressing the recommendations made in the 2014 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from a well-resourced environment that provides for their physical and emotional wellbeing. This has led to children taking more responsibility for their own learning, and for the well-being of themselves and others.</p><p>The newly developed philosophy is increasingly evident in planning, teaching and learning programmes. Teachers intentionally recognise, plan for, and respond to all children's needs, abilities and interests. They help children to think independently, problem solve and extend their interests.</p><p>Teachers form respectful and responsive relationships to support children's learning and wellbeing. Teachers take time to genuinely listen to children and follow their interests. They actively seek and value the aspirations of parents to further support their child's learning and sense of belonging.</p><p>The centre's priorities and expectations for learning are strongly aligned to Te Whāriki and the New Zealand Curriculum. Teachers' planning makes purposeful links to ensure children have varied opportunities to learn within a broad and flexible curriculum. Children experience meaningful and interesting learning contexts for literacy and numeracy. Teachers build children's knowledge and skills through purposeful conversations. As a result, children benefit from learning experiences that support their ongoing development.</p><p>The centre manager and leader have been effective in leading change. Leadership is improvement focussed. This has led to teachers being well supported in improving their assessment practices. Teachers told ERO that the change management process is leading to a more collaborative and consistent approach in planning and implementation of the centre's philosophy.</p><p>The strategic plan is a good model for planning long and short-term goals. The next step is to use this model to clearly identify the centre's priorities and to develop indicators to evaluate ongoing progress towards achieving these goals.</p><p>Teachers are developing a useful process for internal evaluation. Leaders are building a culture of self-reflection. There is an increased focus on positive outcomes resulting from these reviews, and on children achieving their goals and identifying their next learning steps.</p><p>Leaders have identified the need to build their bi-cultural practice and increase the use of te reo and tikanga Māori in their planning, assessment and the daily programme.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the service manager and the head teacher are to:</p><ul>
<li>use the strategic planning framework to better identify centre priorities</li>
<li>use the internal evaluation model to measure the effectiveness of teaching and learning</li>
<li>unpack the philosophy to develop a shared understanding of expectations for teaching and the desired outcomes for children</li>
<li>align the philosophy and the strategic plan with teaching strategies.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance.</p><p>Leaders must develop a robust and compliant appraisal process.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of CAS Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>15 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
