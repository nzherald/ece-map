<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Lake Terrace Preschool and Nursery is a privately-owned centre in eastern Christchurch. The centre caters for infants, toddlers and children up to five years of age. Children are grouped into three classroom areas according to their age. Leaders are working cooperatively with staff to continually develop and improve teaching and learning.</p><p>The centre closed for six weeks following the February 22, 2011 earthquake. It has since experienced significant roll growth due to the closure of other centres in the area. The damage to centre buildings is resulting in the relocation of the centre for approximately three months later in 2012, while repairs are carried out.</p><p>A new leadership team is beginning to set the direction for the development of teaching and learning, following the disruptions of the past year. Children benefit from positive, caring and supportive relationships with their teachers. Staff members work well together to meet the centre&rsquo;s philosophy and respond to children&rsquo;s varied interests.</p><p>Other positive features of the centre include the way leaders and teachers:</p><ul>
<li>are building strong links with children&rsquo;s families</li>
<li>make use of professional development to help improve learning programmes</li>
<li>use their observations to plan programmes that cater for children&rsquo;s interests</li>
<li>support children as they move within and beyond the centre.</li>
</ul><p>Centre managers have identified their next steps for ongoing development as:</p><ul>
<li>including goals in the strategic plan for developing teaching and learning over the coming two years</li>
<li>embedding changes introduced over the past two years, for example, in programme planning</li>
<li>supporting teachers to develop programmes and practices that recognise New&nbsp;Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage, and the identity and culture of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Lake Terrace Preschool and Nursery was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atLake Terrace Preschool and Nursery.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy gives prominence to the role of parents in their children&rsquo;s learning and development. It emphasises the value of children&rsquo;s play, and provides extended periods of uninterrupted play to allow children to explore their emerging interests. The philosophy encourages teachers to listen and respond to children&rsquo;s views and interests.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Supportive relationships. Positive, respectful relationships provide the foundation for effective learning for children. In 2011, centre managers and staff members chose as their major focus to help support children and their families following Christchurch earthquakes, and to settle the many new families that arrived in the centre from mid 2011. This is resulting in a settled, calm environment where children are confident to play and learn. Teachers are working collaboratively within newly formed teams. Their interactions with children are encouraging and supportive. Their next step is to develop these interactions to further extend children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Learning environment. Children benefit from the well planned indoor and outdoor environments. They have sufficient resources to cater for their interests and have good access to a wide range of equipment. Other features of the environment include:</p><ul>
<li>the way it is organised to cater for specific interests, such as challenging physical play for older children</li>
<li>a good indoor-outdoor flow that encourages children&rsquo;s choices</li>
<li>areas that promote literacy experiences, including comfortable spaces for older children to read and share books.</li>
</ul><p>Learning programmes. Teachers follow children&rsquo;s interests closely and support their various choices in play. They use their observations of children well to help plan the programme. Children are provided with a good range of learning activities. They are able to revisit activities to help reinforce their interests and learning. Teachers are developing a consistent approach to support children to manage their behaviour in positive ways. Centre managers have put in place well-planned transitions across centre for children and are fostering strong links with local schools to help ensure a smooth transition to school.</p><p>Planning and assessment. Teachers work well together to plan and assess children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers&rsquo; planning is increasingly focused on expected outcomes for children&rsquo;s learning. Centre managers and head teachers have revised the guidelines for programme planning. A centre-wide format provides effective guidance for teachers. Teachers provide children and parents with a wide range of information about learning activities and children&rsquo;s experiences at the centre through the profile books. These books include some good identification of children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Leadership. Managers provide clear direction and guidance for staff for ongoing developments in teaching and learning. They are making increasing and regular use of self review to guide their decisions and to identify areas for improvement. Centre managers have strengthened the teacher appraisal process and are providing teachers with useful feedback. Centre managers are also working with head teachers to build a shared understanding of high quality teaching and learning across the centre.</p><p>Bicultural experiences. Children have some good opportunities to increase their awareness of M&#257;ori language and culture. The children&rsquo;s kapa haka group gives prominence to learning about New Zealand&rsquo;s unique bicultural context. Some teacher planning shows how M&#257;ori culture is included in the focus for learning. Children regularly participate in waiata and karakia and observe some protocols from M&#257;ori culture.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>Centre managers have identified the following areas for further development, to strengthen teaching and learning. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>extending the strategic plan to include specific priorities for teaching and learning over the next two-to-three years</li>
<li>revisiting assessment practices with teachers to ensure assessment clearly focuses on individual children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>ensuring teachers&rsquo; plans identify what teachers will do to promote learning</li>
<li>continuing to support teachers&rsquo; skills and confidence with te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Lake Terrace Preschool and Nursery completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><p>17 August 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-lake-terrace-preschool-and-nursery" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Lake Terrace Preschool and Nursery</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Lake Terrace Preschool and Nursery.</p><p>Lake Terrace Preschool and Nursery is a privately-owned centre in eastern Christchurch. The centre caters for infants, toddlers and children up to five years of age. Children are grouped into three classroom areas according to their age. Leaders are working cooperatively with staff to continually develop and improve teaching and learning.</p><p>The centre closed for six weeks following the February 22, 2011 earthquake. It has since experienced significant roll growth due to the closure of other centres in the area. The damage to centre buildings is resulting in the relocation of the centre for approximately three months later in 2012, while repairs are carried out.</p><p>A new leadership team is beginning to set the direction for the development of teaching and learning, following the disruptions of the past year. Children benefit from positive, caring and supportive relationships with their teachers. Staff members work well together to meet the centre&rsquo;s philosophy and respond to children&rsquo;s varied interests.</p><p>Other positive features of the centre include the way leaders and teachers:</p><ul>
<li>are building strong links with children&rsquo;s families</li>
<li>make use of professional development to help improve learning programmes</li>
<li>use their observations to plan programmes that cater for children&rsquo;s interests</li>
<li>support children as they move within and beyond the centre.</li>
</ul><p>Centre managers have identified their next steps for ongoing development as:</p><ul>
<li>including goals in the strategic plan for developing teaching and learning over the coming two years</li>
<li>embedding changes introduced over the past two years, for example, in programme planning</li>
<li>supporting teachers to develop programmes and practices that recognise New&nbsp;Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage, and the identity and culture of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
