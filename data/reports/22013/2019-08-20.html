</table><p>Waiatarua Playcentre <span>is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</span></p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waiatarua Playcentre is licensed for 30 children, including 15 under the age of two years. It offers two mixed-age sessions and a SPACE (Supporting Parents Alongside Children's Education) session for parents and babies. The centre operates as a parent cooperative and is part of Playcentre Aotearoa.</p><p>Programmes for children are underpinned by the Playcentre philosophy of whānau and children playing and learning together. Playcentre members recognise parents as first educators of their children. They aim to support each other to provide the best environment for children to learn and grow, and to build relationships within the community. Adult education programmes are offered to all parents who enrol their children at Playcentre. Qualifications gained through these programmes are required for sessions to receive funding.</p><p>All current centre members are new to the centre since ERO's 2015 review. They are committed to improving their adult education levels as new courses become available.</p><p>ERO's 2015 report identified areas for development relating to operational processes and curriculum provision. Current members are working to develop these aspects of their practice.</p><p>The new regional structure for Playcentre Aotearoa came into effect in June 2019. Under this new structure regions are responsible for establishing effective management systems to support each centre. This support includes personnel that regularly visit to carry out administrative tasks and model effective practice in teaching, programme planning and evaluation.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the Playcentre Aotearoa, Northern North Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and demonstrate a sense of belonging at the centre. They confidently make decisions about their play. Children benefit from an attractively presented learning environment that is spacious and well resourced.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are encouraged to explore play areas that have been thoughtfully arranged with these young children in mind. All children benefit from the mixed-age setting and the opportunities for interactions with their peers and other adults.</p><p>Parents/whānau are positive and responsive to children's ideas and requests. They support play through resources and conversations that prompt children's exploration. Children's learning records show their participation in centre sessions and experiences. Adults are building their knowledge of how to write about children's interests and strengths.</p><p>A distributed leadership model involves centre members taking on roles and responsibilities that contribute to centre operations. There is a strong culture of inclusion and support amongst members. Strategic and annual plans guide the centre's future direction. An internal evaluation process guides the review of resources and the environment and contributes to improvements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre members are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop collaborative approaches for assessing, planning and evaluating the curriculum provided for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>begin to include te reo and tikanga Māori, to reflect the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build members' understanding of how to use internal evaluation to identify ways to improve outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The regional manager and support personnel agree that key next steps for the region include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>providing targeted support for centre members to establish effective strategic and annual planning, with links to the long-term goals Playcentre Aotearoa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing and embedding the revised Playcentre adult education programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating the effectiveness and impact of the personnel who are employed to support centres</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing effective programme planning and evaluation processes that support and extend the learning of all children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waiatarua Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to health and safety. Centre members should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>medication records include evidence of parent acknowledgment that medication was administered.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education &amp; Care Services 2008, HS8</em></p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>20 August 2019</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
