</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>This centre is known in the community as Rakiura Rugrats. It is the only early childhood centre on Stewart Island and provides a vital service for the community. The centre offers education and care for up to 20 children aged two-to-five years. In the past, when there has been demand and suitably qualified staff, the centre has also catered for children under two-years old.</p><p>The centre is run by a community-based trust with a parent committee. It receives very strong community support. The centre employs one qualified teacher. She is assisted by teacher aides and parent helpers.</p><p>The committee and teacher have made significant progress in proactively addressing the recommendations in the 2013 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre’s vision is to embrace the unique and special opportunities of Rakiura as the ‘anchor stone’ for the children’s learning. This vision can be seen in practice through the sense of belonging both to the centre and to the island shown by the children and their families.</p><p>Children’s learning is supported by a purposeful programme that reflects the island community and environment. A growing strength of the programme is the learning around New Zealand’s bicultural heritage and in particular the heritage of Rakiura. The teacher includes Māori concepts, such as whanaungatanga (sense of family connection) in planning for children’s learning.</p><p>Children also benefit from a programme that:</p><ul>
<li>responds to their interests</li>
<li>supports their developing oral language, literacy and numeracy</li>
<li>fosters their social competence and independence</li>
<li>encourages them to take responsibility for the environment and their actions.</li>
</ul><p>The teacher effectively leads the programme and guides teacher aides and parent helpers in their work. Parents are actively involved in supporting children’s learning in the centre.</p><p>The teacher, teacher aides and parents:</p><ul>
<li>know the children well and have caring and trusting relationships with them</li>
<li>listen carefully to the children</li>
<li>have genuine conversations with children to provoke and extend their thinking.</li>
</ul><p>The teacher ensures that the programme is responsive to the changing ages of the children at the centre. The centre has very close links with the school enabling smooth transitions. Older children in the centre take part in the newly-introduced bush programme along with children from the school.</p><p>The teacher regularly plans for groups and for individual children in consultation with their parents. The stories in children’s profile books are an attractive record of the range of experiences, developing dispositions, and episodes of learning. The teacher along with her external advisor has identified that planning could be simpler and profile books should better show how children’s learning develops over time. ERO agrees.</p><h4>Governance and leadership</h4><p>The hard-working committee members have taken useful action to ensure the ongoing sustainability and viability of the centre. It sought external support to build its own and the teacher’s capabilities. For example, they ensured there was an advice and guidance programme in place for the teacher and undertook training for effective self review and strategic planning. The strategic plan clearly indentifies the priorities and actions for future development.</p><p>In 2015 the committee contracted the Southland Kindergarten Association to provide governance, management and professional support for the centre. This has proved very useful, and ERO sees the value in continuing such an arrangement.</p><p>The committee and teacher work very well together to ensure the smooth operations of the centre. They have made good use of self review to bring about improvements. The committee has identified and ERO agrees, that the appraisal system should be further developed to better meet current requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre and ERO agree that key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>simplify systems for planning</li>
<li>better show continuity of children’s learning in the records of learning</li>
<li>strengthen the appraisal system.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Stewart Island EC Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Stewart Island EC Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>9 September 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
