</table><p>Carol White Family Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Carol White Family Centre is located in the Selwyn College Campus, next to classrooms where children's parents participate in the REAF (Refugee Education and Families) programme. The centre is licensed for 41 children, including 12 up to two years of age. Infants and toddlers have a separate indoor area but often mix with the older children.</p><p>The multilingual staff reflect the centre’s ethnically diverse community. Four qualified teachers are supported by additional staff and volunteers who provide pastoral care and language support for children and their families. Daily management of the centre is delegated to a director. The centre is governed by a management committee of representatives from the centre staff, the school and parents. The committee is responsible for the financial and operational management of the centre.</p><p>In 2015 ERO noted positive aspects of the centre included the quality of relationships, leadership, and the curriculum experienced by children. ERO recommended that the committee and teachers develop a strategic plan and improve teacher appraisal processes. Some progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at this centre are confident, enthusiastic learners who negotiate, play cooperatively and spend time in focused activities of their choice. Infants and toddlers have very good opportunities to explore resources and the environment alongside older children. The indoor and outdoor areas provide a range of equipment that is attractive and inviting for children.</p><p>Teachers' caring, and welcoming interactions are strengthened by their in-depth knowledge about children's languages and cultures. Their conversations acknowledge children’s interests and they listen carefully to children. Teachers are working to grow their understanding of tikanga and increase their use of te reo Māori. Children are well supported to learn and communicate in English, and often in several other languages. Teachers regularly integrate literacy experiences into children’s play.</p><p>Parents appreciate the high level of respect for their languages, cultural values and identities. They are well informed about their children's learning. Parents are encouraged to make comments and share their aspirations for children's learning in their first language. Families value teachers' and pastoral support workers' commitment to help them maintain their sense of wellbeing and belonging in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>Teachers discuss each child's strengths and interests. They are increasingly using this information to record children's learning. Attractive individual learning records show that children have opportunities to investigate, ask questions and play cooperatively with others. Teachers skilfully assess each child's learning and recognise their progress over time.</p><p>Teachers now need to evaluate the impact of the curriculum on children's learning. It would be useful to regularly report this information to the management committee to celebrate the learning that is happening for children at the centre.</p><p>Centre staff enact a shared vision to empower children and families through culturally responsive teaching practices and effective pastoral care provision. The director supports teachers to grow leadership skills through having increased responsibility for aspects of centre operations. Teachers' capability is enhanced through extensive professional development, including participation in research projects. The management committee continues to support the director and staff to maintain operational requirements and make ongoing improvements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the management committee and teachers evaluating and documenting progress towards meeting the service's strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the management committee and director implementing a teacher appraisal process that meets Teaching Council requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teaching staff implementing and documenting a cycle of internal evaluation for improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Carol White Family Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>2 October 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
