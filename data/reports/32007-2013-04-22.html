<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Paeroa Playcentre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Paeroa Playcentre is a parent cooperative operating under the umbrella of Thames Valley Coromandel Playcentre Association (the association). Since the 2010 ERO review, parents have made significant improvements to the established and spacious indoor and outdoor environments. The number of sessions providing education and care has increased to three per week. The Ministry of Education has recently relicensed the centre under the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008 to cater for 25 children per session, including 12 under two years old. Thirty-seven children are currently enrolled.</p><p>The playcentre&rsquo;s philosophy aims to promote and provide quality education within a wh&#257;nau/family environment. Experienced centre members have established a culture of whanaungatanga where new families feel welcome and children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging. Bicultural perspectives are increasingly evident throughout the centre.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation and the association provide governance and support. The association promotes success for M&#257;ori as M&#257;ori through training initiatives and Puriri o Whakamaru, a group that encourages and funds local and national leadership initiatives. A recently appointed and experienced liaison officer is employed by the association to support the centre with regular advice and guidance for centre operations and curriculum development.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in six early childhood education services within the Thames Valley/Coromandel Playcentre Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn alongside caring adults who know them well. Babies and toddlers benefit from the nurture and care of their parents in a well-equipped and designated area. Experienced members model good teaching practice to sustain children&rsquo;s engagement in play activities and extend their skills and oral language. Parents plan special activities and excursions to extend children&rsquo;s knowledge of the wider world. They promote the development of early literacy and mathematics skills through shared stories, access to a range of writing materials and puzzles, and their conversations with children.</p><p>The programme recognises children&rsquo;s strengths, interests and parents&rsquo; aspirations for children&rsquo;s next development steps. Attractively presented profile books document aspects of children&rsquo;s participation in the playcentre programme. Toddlers and young children have many opportunities to make choices, explore, experiment and sustain their play. Children readily access a well-designed outdoor environment that promotes their understanding of the natural world and early science concepts. They demonstrate confidence in playing together and sustaining their engagement in dramatic and imaginary play.</p><p>M&#257;ori parents acknowledge a sense of kotahitanga and the increased visibility and valuing of their culture. This is enhanced by the appointment of a wh&#257;nau representative who has responsibility for promoting bicultural perspectives throughout the centre. These include activities, equipment and displays that emphasise te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori. There has been a deliberate focus on creating a welcoming atmosphere that promotes the inclusion of M&#257;ori families and success for their children.</p><p>Playcentre leaders have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities, including effective processes for annual planning, financial management and self review. Experienced leaders and the liaison officer foster emergent leadership to promote succession. Many parents are participating in training courses provided by the association to develop their knowledge and understanding of best teaching practice for young children. The liaison officer regularly provides parents with positive feedback and helpful next steps for continuing improvement. The recent review and restructuring of the association&rsquo;s governance and management processes is resulting in more professional contact with the centre and a higher priority on the quality of education to improve outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre members agree that important next steps are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>develop programme planning and interactions that effectively respond to the needs of older children, particularly boys</li>
<li>increase children&rsquo;s ready access to displays about their learning, including portfolio books, to enable regular revisiting and discussion with others</li>
<li>review children&rsquo;s access to stored materials and equipment to maximise potential for learning</li>
<li>increase opportunities for children to develop self-management skills and take responsibility for setting up, tidying and caring for the environment.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Paeroa Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>22 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
