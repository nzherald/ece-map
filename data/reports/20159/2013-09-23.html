</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Ascot Avenue offers full day and part-time education and care for children up to five years of age. It is licensed for 50 children, including up to 16 infants and toddlers under two years of age. The centre is divided into separate areas to cater for the different age groups. Children of all ages also have opportunities to play together for long periods of time.</p><p>The centre has undergone major change since the 2010 ERO review. It changed ownership in 2011 to Kidicorp Limited. The management structures of the previous ABC owners were retained until the beginning of 2013, when Kidicorp administrative and management systems were fully implemented.</p><p>There has been high turnover of centre managers over the past three years. Presently an experienced manager is acting in the role until the newly appointed permanent centre manager takes up her position. Some changes in teaching staff have also occurred. Present ratios of staff to children exceed minimum requirements to support the centre through this period of change.</p><p>ERO’s 2010 report noted that children enjoyed a positive learning environment. Respectful relationships, well managed routines, and strong parent and centre partnerships were noted as features of the centre. The report recommended improvements to interactions and resources to further develop children’s complex play and critical thinking.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The numerous changes in leadership have affected the positive learning environment of the centre noted in the 2010 ERO report. The appointment of a Kidicorp professional services manager at the beginning of 2013 has had a positive impact. Personnel management concerns have been addressed. A strategic plan, supported by an action plan, clearly identifies areas for development needed to lift the overall quality of teaching and learning in the centre.</p><p>Effective working partnerships with parents that benefit children continue to be a strong feature. Parents and teachers exchange information about children’s learning and development in relaxed informal ways. Managers are keeping parents informed of the changes happening in the centre, gathering feedback and responding well to parent aspirations for their children.</p><p>The centre has begun the process of rebuilding the teaching team. Managers and teachers are in the early stages of redeveloping a centre philosophy based on their values and beliefs for children’s learning and well being. There are plans to continue consultation with parents and key staff before fully integrating this philosophy into the curriculum and teaching practices. Self review is used successfully as a tool to drive change and improvement.</p><p>There are some examples of skilful interactions between teachers and children that support children’s play. In these instances teachers respond enthusiastically to child initiated conversations and provide constructive feedback to promote creative thinking and problem solving. Managers have a planned approach to improving the consistency of high quality interactions through modelling and targeted professional learning opportunities.</p><p>The programme provides opportunities for children to enjoy their play. This is especially evident for older children. Children are active and resourceful at creating their own play. They take initiative and are supported in developing self-managing skills. Routines are unobtrusive and unhurried allowing time for sustained play. Managers have identified the need to establish programme planning systems to identify and record ways that staff intend to extend older children’s interests. They have also identified the need to improve the quality of the service provided for infants and toddlers.</p><p>Te reo and tikanga Māori are integrated into the programme, the environment and centre practices. Cultural diversity is acknowledged and celebrated in interactions and the learning programme. Children enjoy spacious learning environments, access to good equipment, and colourful displays celebrating their participation in the centre programme. A review of the large outdoor space is underway with positive changes for children already apparent with a range of engaging activities, including opportunities for physical play and enjoyment of the natural environment.</p><p>Kidicorp’s well established quality assurance and self-review systems and strategic approaches are likely to support continual improvement in the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers and ERO agree that areas for further improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>developing a cohesive professional teaching team</li>
<li>giving priority to improving teachers’ knowledge and understanding of high quality practices that support the care and education for infants and toddlers</li>
<li>establishing assessment and planning practices that successfully support children’s learning and high quality teaching.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Ascot Avenue completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement</em> and<em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the review ERO identified an area of non-compliance. To address this, Kidicorp and centre managers must:</p><ul>
<li>ensure that the curriculum is informed by assessment, planning, and evaluation,</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C2.</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Ascot Avenue will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>23 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
