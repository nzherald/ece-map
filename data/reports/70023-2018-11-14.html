</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Skiwiland Mt Hutt is one of two centres owned by New Zealand Ski Limited, which operate in unique alpine settings. It is located in the Mt Hutt base building on the mountain. The centre is open from June to October, seven days a week, during the ski season. It provides half and full-day education and care for mixed-aged children. The centre is licensed for 31 children, including four under the age of two.</p><p>The centre's philosophy and education programme are focused on a safe, specialised skiing and snow play culture, and experiences in the mountain environment in winter.</p><p>The specific setting of the centre and the casual nature of its clientele make relationship building and staffing retention key annual priorities. A stable management and leadership team has overseen some changes in staffing since the last review. Staffing has been more stable in recent seasons. Teachers and leaders are from diverse backgrounds with a range of appropriate early childhood, primary education and ski instruction qualifications.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2013, the centre has made progress in:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening the partnership with the ski school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>outcomes-based strategic planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening assessment processes for children who attend regularly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building and extending teaching and learning programmes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening supervision plans and processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's unique Skiwiland philosophy is strongly evident in all aspects of its identity and programme. Children learn and play in a nurturing environment which promotes fun, safety and exploration. A specific and localised curriculum, aligned to Te Whāriki, provides snow sports opportunities and an awareness of the history and connections to the mountain.</p><p>Leaders and teachers prioritise the building of warm, welcoming relationships with children and their families (Manaakitanga). They respectfully meet the needs and aspirations of families in an environment of relational trust where children come first. Centre staff understand the importance of settling and caring for children who have short term connections with them.</p><p>Children are cared for and supported to achieve the key priorities for their learning, outlined in appropriate planning processes. They are encouraged to follow their own interests and curiosities and, in time, to explore, experience and enjoy the outside ski field environment. A three-tiered learning and care programme ensures that readiness to learn and explore is age and development appropriate. This allows children time to practise working in groups and adapt to changes in routines.</p><p>Assessment practices for effective planning reflect what matters most for the children in the alpine environment. Children are provided with specific contexts, resources and instructional activities to develop a life-long interest in snow sports. Families are kept informed about, and encouraged to participate in, their children's progress and achievements. All children and families receive a progression card which contains skill assessments in snow sports.</p><p>Significant numbers of families participate in centre surveys to support processes for ongoing improvements in the service. Leaders, teachers and ski instructors gather information on their families so that children quickly develop a sense of belonging. Children benefit from the caring, skilful approaches within the centre.</p><p>There is a growing commitment to bicultural practices that form an integral part of everyday life in the centre. These practices honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi and help children, including Māori children, to understand and connect with local stories associated with the mountain. Kaiako, including international teachers and instructors, are committed to improving their reo Māori and knowledge of tikanga.</p><p>The indoor under-two area is a calm, well-resourced area focused on the needs of the children. Families are encouraged to spend time settling their children and developing the important relationship with the teacher so that children are happy and engaged. Collaborative approaches to managing the different areas of the centre enable tuakana teina relationships and learning opportunities with older children to occur (Ako).</p><p>The centre manager and lead teacher are modelling a collaborative, strategic culture in the centre. A family-like atmosphere ensures that children's learning and other needs are prioritised. The teacher appraisal system supports these practices and ensures that teachers' daily reflections are focused on positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Leaders have been instrumental in building centre capability and sustainability since the last review. Clarity of communications across the centre has ensured that seasonal staff are inducted, trained and educated in all aspects of operations.</p><p>Leaders and senior business managers have established well-planned, cohesive systems that strongly link the education and care focus in the centre with the overarching business model. The connection between the centre's vision and values and those of New Zealand Ski Limited are clearly evident in a range of documents and processes, and reflect the specific aspirations of families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre leaders agree that the key next steps for teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop a PLD plan which reflects current and future priorities for centre improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop bicultural practices to reflect an ongoing commitment to te Tiriti o Waitangi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>explore opportunities to become involved in a Kāhui Ako|Community of Learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop the quality of learning and teaching in the unique setting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase the visibility and impact of Te Whāriki curriculum planning and programmes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Skiwiland Mt Hutt completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Skiwiland Mt Hutt will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>14 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
