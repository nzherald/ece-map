</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ellerslie Playcentre in Auckland is an established centre that caters for children up to six years of age. It offers four general sessions each week. Learning programmes are implemented by parents/whānau who are also centre members. Two paid supervisors facilitate an additional ‘Big Kids’ session for older children.</p><p>Members have made very good progress in addressing the recommendations in the 2010 ERO report. They have reviewed areas of play to improve children’s access to resources and the provision for infants in the centre environment. The integration of literacy, science, numeracy and recognition of New Zealand’s dual cultural heritage is now more evident in the programme. The playcentre is currently fundraising to significantly upgrade the building.</p><p>The centre is one of 16 playcentres in the Tamaki Playcentre Association, which provides a management and policy framework to guide centre operations. Liaison officers and other Association staff provide support for centres, including adult education programmes to encourage children’s learning.</p><p>The Association is currently undergoing a structural review to streamline its systems, policies and practices and ensure the long-term sustainability of the organisation. A key priority is to empower playcentre members to take an active role in the governance of the organisation at the Association level.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six playcentre reviews in the Tamaki Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The playcentre philosophy of parents and children learning, playing and growing together is very evident. Children enjoy positive, respectful and inclusive relationships with a variety of adults and other children of different ages. Babies have access to appropriate resources and opportunities to explore in the indoor and outdoor areas. Older children are enthusiastic and capable learners who make confident decisions to extend their learning experiences. Reviewing the provision for toddlers could enable members to more effectively support the increased mobility and independence of this age group.</p><p>Members are highly responsive to children’s interests and skilfully support children’s exploration and investigation. They engage in meaningful conversations, using appropriate questions to promote children’s thinking. Members use positive approaches to support children to manage their own behaviour. They have made positive improvements to practices that reflect the dual heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p><p>Members regularly talk about children’s emerging interests and preferred areas of play. Children’s ideas are sought and used thoughtfully to plan a broad range of experiences that engage individuals and groups of children. Adults could now focus more on using end of session and termly discussions to recognise the learning that happens in play.</p><p>Centre members are focused on maintaining and improving playcentre education levels to support the ongoing sustainability of the centre. Self-review systems and a long-term strategic plan have been developed. Members use strategic plan goals and work as a team to make helpful improvements to centre practices and systems.</p><p>Association management practices are well established. A current strategic review is focused on streamlining association systems, policies and practices to make them more manageable and to build the operational knowledge of playcentre members. Members report that the Association is very responsive to requests for support and guidance to manage the centre. The Association could now consider how staff can support centres to strengthen their strategic planning and self review practices. Guiding the improved quality of programmes in centres should be a more important aspect of the liaison officer role.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members and ERO agree that key next steps for members include:</p><ul>
<li>developing a shared understanding and agreed approaches for extending older children’s learning in general and to help ensure ‘Big Kids’ sessions support children’s transition to school well</li>
<li>determining what difference centre practices make to children’s learning when evaluating programme, self review and strategic planning systems</li>
<li>identifying ways to continue to develop leadership and knowledge of centre operations amongst a wider group of members</li>
</ul><h3>Tamaki Playcentre Association Information</h3><p>The cluster review of six playcentres within the Tamaki Playcentre Association has identified areas of governance and management for the Association to address. These include:</p><ul>
<li>re-establishing performance management systems for all employed staff</li>
<li>documenting strategic and annual planning systems for the association as a whole</li>
<li>clearly documenting a cycle of review and evaluation to support ongoing development and improvement at the association level.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ellerslie Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Ellerslie Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>10 March 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
