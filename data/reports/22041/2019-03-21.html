</table><p>Greenhithe Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Greenhithe Playcentre operates as a parent cooperative and is licensed for 30 children, including 15 children under two years of age. The centre offers four sessions a week. Most children attend two or three sessions. Greenhithe Playcentre celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2018.</p><p>Programmes for children are guided by by the Playcentre philosophy of parents and children playing and learning together. The centre's philosophy focuses on children's learning, nurturing caregivers, and maintaining a balance between centre commitments and the members' wellbeing.</p><p>The centre is part of the newly established Northern North Island Playcentre Region. Regional systems support centre members to manage their centres and to provide educational programmes for their children. Playcentre personnel also provide adult education programmes for parents/whānau to achieve Playcentre qualifications.</p><p>Since the 2014 ERO evaluation all centre members are new. Current centre members have focused on building membership numbers and increasing new members' qualifications. New members are committed to increase their Playcentre qualification levels.</p><p>This review is one of 12 in the Northern North Island Playcentre Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at Greenhithe Playcentre are happy, confident and articulate learners. They have a strong sense of wellbeing and show pride in being part of their centre. Children and adults benefit from a family-friendly approach and an environment that welcomes children and their whānau. Children develop positive relationships and friendships with their peers and adults.</p><p>Children enjoy opportunities for collaborative, independent and imaginative play. They learn in mixed-age groups. The spacious outdoor environment provides ample room for children to explore, and take risks to direct their own learning. The indoor environment is creatively presented, and provides a very good range of learning resources.</p><p>Children have opportunities to learn te reo Māori through waiata, poi and events. The inside environment's resources and wall displays reflect centre members' commitment to bicultural practices.</p><p>Good processes are in place to help adults improve programme planning, assessment and evaluation that is linked to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. A deliberate focus on individual learning experiences is recorded at the end of each session. Children's portfolios provide a valued record of children's learning. Newer centre members are well supported to build their knowledge and understanding in recording children’s learning progress. Parents could further their use of questioning skills to extend the complexity of play for children over time.</p><p>The centre is well led by a group of committed and enthusiastic centre members. Experienced parents/whānau provide mentoring and professional internal support for newer members. Emergent leadership is encouraged and members work collaboratively.</p><p>An annual plan successfully guides centre direction and key focus areas. Centre members use a useful framework to guide their internal evaluation. To strengthen internal evaluation, members could record how internal evaluation has improved outcomes for children.</p><p>The regional structure is replacing individual Playcentre Associations. Newly appointed regional personnel are making good progress building on existing systems and establishing effective regional management structures for supporting centres. Centre support workers are guided by regional centre support coordinators. Systems are being developed for monitoring the quality of programmes for children, adult education levels, and health and safety requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Next steps for centre members are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further develop evaluative thinking in internal evaluations and to include resulting improved outcomes for children’s learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the centre's philosophy to recognise bicultural practices and reflect centre members' increasingly diverse cultural backgrounds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement strategic goals for ongoing improvement that align with the annual plan.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The Northern North Island Playcentre regional manager (acting) and support personnel agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implementing and embedding the revised Playcentre adult education programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing a framework to evaluate the effectiveness of centre support systems, roles and processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Greenhithe Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>21 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
