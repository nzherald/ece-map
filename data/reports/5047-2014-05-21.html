</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Favona Kindergarten, adjacent to Favona Primary School in Mangere, provides for up to 40 children from around three years old to school age. Families have the option of enrolling their child for six hour days or for morning sessions. The kindergarten is popular and the roll is strong.</p><p>The majority of families are Pacific, with increasing numbers of Māori and Fijian Indian whānau attending. The kindergarten’s multicultural teaching team includes four fully qualified teachers, teacher assistants and an administrator. Many staff and families have a long-term involvement with the kindergarten, which adds to the rich connections between staff, families and children. An outstanding feature of this kindergarten is the warmly welcoming atmosphere that encourages a high level of parent and whānau participation.</p><p>Favona Kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA) and operates within the AKA policies and management framework. A professional services manager (PSM) visits regularly and provides professional advice and support for teachers.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are enthusiastic about attending kindergarten. They have fun and enjoy their learning. They are confident communicators in English and their home languages. Children are independent and self-managing. They know how to interact appropriately with others, show care and concern, and play safely and inclusively. Children learn new skills, knowledge, and ways of working and thinking. They can lead and support others with confidence.</p><p>The programme provides a rich and varied range of experiences for children. Teachers plan meaningful and challenging learning activities, which are responsive to the interests and perspectives of children and whānau. Literacy, numeracy, science and the arts are woven naturally into the programme through every day events as the programme includes opportunities for children to learn about the local and wider community. The curriculum provides an educational foundation that supports the range of skills children will need as life-long learners.</p><p>Teachers have caring and purposeful learning relationships with adults and children in which everyone’s contribution is valued. Teachers are highly engaged in their teaching roles and provide children with very effective support to encourage their learning. Staff talk with children in their home languages, and have high quality interactions with them. They use digital technologies in meaningful ways to help extend children’s learning and understandings. Teachers empower children to reach their potential and take great pride in their achievements.</p><p>Teachers value the language, heritages and cultures of all children and their families. They have participated in ongoing professional learning to build their cultural competence in te reo and tikanga Māori. This has generated new and deeper understandings about Māori culture amongst children and adults. It has also prompted the kindergarten to hold regular cultural festivals to learn about and celebrate the diverse cultures in the community.</p><p>Practices that support the high level of parent and whānau participation in the kindergarten and their children’s learning include:</p><ul>
<li>welcoming parents and emphasising that the kindergarten belongs to the whānau as well as the children</li>
<li>teachers taking an interest in whānau, their culture, interests, experiences and strengths</li>
<li>open communication and frequent consultation that results in positive changes</li>
<li>providing an inviting whānau area with comfortable seating and refreshment facilities.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers’ familiarity with the community, families/whānau and the school continues to inform initiatives such as the provision of healthy lunch boxes and responsive parent education. The kindergarten operates as a support system and hub for the local community.</p><p>Teachers are up to date with current theory in early childhood education. They advance their professional knowledge individually and as a team, and work cooperatively in all aspects of their practice. They are able to demonstrate continual improvement through their practice, but agree that documentation is not their strength. However, the Professional Services Manager has been supporting the team to document their decisions about the programme and management of the kindergarten. This is helping the team to better meet requirements for self review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers, the PSM and ERO agree that the key next steps for the kindergarten are to improve documentation of self review and curriculum management.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Favona Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Favona Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>21 May 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
