</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Li'l Champs Educare 3 opened in 2016, and is one of three Li'l Champs services. Located in a purpose-built facility, it is licensed to cater for 45 children including up to 15 under the age of two years. There are currently no children under the age of two enrolled at the service.</p><p>The owner and centre manager are supported by six registered teachers in two age related rooms. A cook provides daily meals. There have been three centre managers since opening in 2016. The current manager was employed in mid-2017.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is based on the values of learning, love and laughter, and to equip children as life-long learners. It incorporates both the principles of Montessori and <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the New Zealand Early Childhood curriculum.</p><p>This is ERO's first review of the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children display respect and independence in their play. Teachers place a strong emphasis on these values in the programme. Children spend the majority of their time engaged with Montessori activities that support and help develop their fine motor control. They confidently revisit activities previously modelled by teachers. Children are able to choose from a variety of activities offered by teachers, who support them to independently complete these tasks.</p><p>Teachers offer a curriculum that includes multiple philosophies. It is strongly influenced by the Montessori programme, and is increasingly offering a more child-initiated curriculum. Teachers' assessment of children's learning is heavily focused on their completion of Montessori activities. Teachers are beginning to plan to extend children's learning by identifying and using children's interests and dispositions for learning. However, this is more noticeable in the younger children's room.</p><p>The centre manager promotes the importance of parents as partners in their children's learning. Partnerships are enhanced by inviting parents to share their aspirations through surveys, formal interviews with teachers, and through input into policies and practices. Teachers support parents' understanding of learning by highlighting how children are learning in displays of photos of children engaged in play.</p><p>The centre manager has a strong commitment to supporting teachers to include aspects of te reo and tikanga Māori in the daily programme. Children and teachers participate in waiata, karakia and basic instruction in te reo Māori. Children's home languages are valued and encouraged in order to develop children's confidence in learning English. Children have many opportunities to experience a variety of cultural celebrations. Children with additional needs are very well supported. Teachers work closely with external agencies when extra support and expertise is required.</p><p>The owners of the three centres have made good progress with implementing documentation that guides all of the centres operations. <em>Tātaiako:</em> Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners, is now included by the centre in useful performance management documentation and processes. Education Council Standards for the Teaching Profession are included in the appraisal process. The centre owner and manager are keen for staff to participate in professional learning around incorporating Pacific language and culture into the programme.</p><p>Teachers participate in external professional development to increase their understanding of internal evaluation. The centre manager has developed useful templates to guide internal evaluation processes. These support teachers with self-review of programmes and teaching practices. They also support the centre manager with planning for the future direction of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner and centre manager agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further increasing the variety of resources that challenge and encourage problem-solving, cooperation and relationship building especially in the outdoors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embedding the principles and strands of <em>Te Whāriki</em> into the programme consistently and throughout the centre with a focus on identifying ways to further extend children's individual interests and learning dispositions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building teachers' reflective practice and evaluative thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to enhance teacher's knowledge and use of te ao Māori in the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that children's individual portfolios reflect and celebrate their cultural backgrounds.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Li'l Champs Educare 3 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice the owner should clearly articulate and include reference to the Treaty partnership in the service philosophy.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Li'l Champs Educare 3 will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>13 March 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
