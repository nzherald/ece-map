</table><p>Talented Tots Mt Albert is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Talented Tots Mt Albert provides education and care for children from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds. The centre is licensed to provide for up to 25 children over the age of two years. They are catered for as one group, in purpose-built premises next to the local primary school.</p><p>The centre is one of four in Auckland owned and operated by CTA Enterprise Ltd. The centre owner is the service provider, governs the centre and provides overall financial management. She employs the services of an educational consultant to support the head teacher, who was appointed in 2018. Further staffing appointments are pending. The centre currently employs two registered teachers.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is consistent with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. It promotes curiosity, creativity, resilience and independence through child-led play. It acknowledges the Treaty of Waitangi.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report acknowledged good practices related to teaching and learning that continue to be strengths. Areas for improvement identified in the 2016 report related to aspects of management, including performance management and self review. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from respectful relationships and enjoy positive interactions that support their wellbeing and their learning. They have many opportunities to develop social skills, oral language, and early literacy and numeracy. Environmental sustainability is promoted in the curriculum.</p><p>Children are well cared for and learn in a calm, unhurried environment. They have extended periods when they make choices about their play with the support of helpful teachers. Children move freely between the indoor and outdoor areas.</p><p>Teachers set up the spacious learning areas with interesting resources and activities that encourage children to inquire and explore. They identify children's interests and support them through inquiries while allowing the children to lead their own learning.</p><p>Teachers keep very good records of their observations of children. These records help the teachers share their knowledge of children and how they plan to support their learning. Professional discussions related to the programme during staff meetings ensure that teachers know the children well. Information about children and their learning is shared with parents through individual portfolios.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to learn about aspects of te ao Māori through the programme and through their interactions with teachers. Te reo Māori is used at mat times and incidentally during interactions between teachers and children.</p><p>Children are well supported to transition into the centre and when they transition to school. The centre has regular communication with staff of the local school that many of the children attend when they leave the centre. The centre's curriculum helps children to move confidently to school.</p><p>The head teacher provides very good professional leadership. The owner is committed to building and supporting centre leadership and effective teaching practice. The support provided through an education consultant is having a positive impact on centre operations. The teacher appraisal process has been improved. Ongoing and relevant professional development promote teachers' professional growth.</p><p>Centre operations are guided by an up-to-date policy framework. Strategic planning provides a clear direction for improvement, and the annual plan ensures that management tasks are done in a timely manner.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner and head teacher agree that next steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to build learning partnerships between parents and staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening support for children to have confidence in their cultural identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>re-establishing a stable teaching team with a shared philosophy and approach to early childhood education.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Talented Tots Mt Albert completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>27 February 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
