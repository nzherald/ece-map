</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>St Mary's Tahatai Centre is located in Papamoa opposite Tahatai Coast School. It is an all day education and care centre that caters for children from the age of two to school age in mixed- age sessions. The centre is community based and licensed for 32 children including six up to two years. At the time of this ERO review 44 children were enrolled, including five Māori children.</p><p>The service shares a common management structure with St Mary's Family Centre and operates under the governance of the Anglican Parish of Mount Maunganui and the St Mary's Child Care Governance Board. They provide the centre with governance, strategic direction, management support and policies, procedures and guidelines. The centre's practice is based on the guiding principles of the Anglican ethos of care, respect and equity. The trust endeavours to provide affordable, high quality education and a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><p>The centre philosophy aims to provide a free-play environment with planned learning experiences and structured routines, underpinned with Christian values, to empower children to learn and grow within a caring and stable environment.</p><p>The centre manager uses her experience and knowledge to provide professional leadership. The teaching staff has remained consistent since the previous ERO review. The majority of teachers are qualified early childhood teachers. The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>St Mary's Tahatai Centre is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre is welcoming and inclusive of all parents and children. Interactions between teachers and children are sensitive, responsive and promote children's health and wellbeing. Children are highly engaged in learning and play activities, which cater for a range of interests and ability levels. Teachers listen to children, and use effective strategies to model and extend their vocabulary and oral language skills. Children are confident to express their ideas and emotions. Respectful relationships foster children's social and emotional competencies and these help to develop their resilience and self-management skills.</p><p>Children happily engage in a variety of creative activities, messy play, and physical challenges and take the opportunity to explore and investigate. The indoor and outdoor areas encourage children's sense of wonder and invites exploration and imaginative play. The environment is well set up and allows children to make independent choices from a range of attractive and well-presented areas and resources. The centre garden is actively used and provides sustainability projects to extend and challenge children's learning about the natural world.</p><p>The daily programme is an effective combination of planned and spontaneous experiences based on children's interests and preferences. Regular planning and evaluation ensures literacy, numeracy, te reo Māori and Christian values are integrated into the programme in meaningful contexts. These deliberate and purposeful approaches ensures that core skills and learning dispositions are actively promoted and assessed.</p><p>Children are confident decision makers and communicators. There are many opportunities for them to be leaders, to take risks and learn through trial and error. The highly effective teaching team skilfully notice and respond to children’s interests by engaging them in conversations to extend their ideas and add complexity to their play. Nurturing, unhurried routines foster independence by deliberately building children’s confidence to take responsibility for self-care routines and personal belongings.</p><p>Parents are well informed about their child's learning and progress. Learning stories and portfolios provide children and parents with the opportunity to revisit learning and discuss their experiences. Portfolios are shared with the local school when children move on to the new entrants' class, and are a key aspect of their successful transition to school. A next step for the centre is to explore more effective ways of gathering parent aspirations and sharing current assessment information to continue to strengthen the learning partnership with parents and whānau.</p><p>The centre actively promotes Māori language, identity and culture. This is evident in the environment and teacher practice. Māori mythology and excursions to areas of significance to local iwi are integral aspects of the programme. Māori core values such as manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, kaitiakitanga and ako are interwoven with the Christian values and 'Fruits of the Spirit' curriculum. The integration of festivals including Matariki, Diwali and Christian celebrations and this encourages children's cultural understandings and holistic development. Māori children and whānau appreciate their language and culture being valued and shared through waiata, te reo and respect for tikanga Māori practices. Teachers participate in ongoing professional learning and development to build their capacity in bicultural practice including a current self review project using the principles of <em>Ka Hikitia</em>.</p><p>Highly effective leadership is provided by the trustees and centre manager. A clear direction is provided for the ongoing development of the service. Trustees and leaders have a very good understanding of the purpose of self review, at a planned and strategic level, and use a well-developed framework for major reviews. A well-managed performance management process integrates inquiry into teacher practice and includes regular reflection on achieving positive outcomes for all children.</p><p>Regular professional development to build teachers' collective capacity is provided by trustees and management. This ensures teachers are up to date with current research and best practice in early childhood education. There are high levels of collaboration and trust amongst the teaching team, and they share responsibility for promoting positive outcomes for all children and their families.</p><p>Leaders provide excellent support and intervention for children with special needs and their families. Positive, respectful, trusting and reciprocal relationship are established with parents and whānau.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of St Mary's Tahatai Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of St Mary's Tahatai Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>16 September 2016</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> E<a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">RO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
