</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Homai Ngā Taonga Early Childhood Centre is located on the grounds of Homai Primary School in Manurewa and is a community-based childcare centre. The centre operates from a building owned by the Ministry of Education and is divided into two separate rooms that provide for infants and toddlers, and for older children. This is the centre’s first ERO review.</p><p>The centre provides all day education and care services for up to 50 children aged between three months and five years old. It opened two years ago and is one of three early childhood services managed by the Taonga Education Centre Charitable Trust. The Trust was established in 2002 for the benefit of teenage mothers and their babies, and the local community. It has a focus on promoting wellbeing from a tikanga Māori perspective.</p><p>The centre has a supervisor and a team of teachers. The support and guidance of the Trust’s manager along with an experienced head teacher have aided centre developments. The centre has a family focused environment. It has a very high teacher to child ratio. The integration of te reo me ngā Tikanga Māori through the daily programme is a particular feature of the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre has a very positive tone. All children are welcomed, valued and included in the programme. Children are treated with dignity and respect, and experience an unhurried and relaxed programme. They enjoy positive and affirming relationships with teachers and benefit from sharing conversations about their play. Children settle quickly into the centre, selecting activities and playing confidently on their own or with others, often for sustained lengths of time. Infants and toddlers are encouraged to be independent explorers and make discoveries from a range of accessible resources.</p><p>Māori children are particularly well supported through a high Māori content in the programme. This content includes integrated te reo, waiata and karakia, resources with Māori themes and opportunities to participate in powhiri. In this supportive environment tuakana/teina relationships are evident and children show a sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>Pacific children are well settled in the centre. They use their own languages with some of the teachers and enjoy a learning environment that celebrates their identity and language. A good range of learning activities is provided.</p><p>Teachers know children and families well. They show a strong commitment to valuing children’s language, culture and identify, recognising individual strengths and knowledge, and family aspirations. Teachers encourage children to learn at their own pace, providing periods of uninterrupted play, to enable them to repeat or sustain an activity.</p><p>Programme planning, assessment and evaluation processes are well established to promote children’s learning. Weekly team meetings support teachers to work together to develop shared ideas and approaches. Teachers take shared responsibility for children’s learning. They communicate well and receive good support from the head teacher. They have recently reviewed and improved children’s individual portfolios.</p><p>Teachers are now strongly focused on identifying progress and achievement in children’s learning stories. They use photographs very well to demonstrate children’s participation in the learning programme.</p><p>While teachers plan separately for infants, toddlers and young children there is continuity in planning and careful transitioning as children move between rooms. Teachers also endeavour to prepare children well for school.</p><p>The Trust’s governance model enables each of its centres to develop a specific philosophy within its kaupapa. The Trust’s manager provides effective leadership and guidance support. The centre managers reflect on ways to further improve curriculum practices. They promote the centre vision and are committed to ongoing improvement. Self review of te reo Māori me ngā Tikanga has resulted in the centre philosophy changing, to better reflect the community.</p><p>Since the centre has opened, good progress has been made in building staff capacity to lead and manage the centre. Appropriate professional learning to support teachers’ development has been accessed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to improve the quality of the programme and promote positive outcomes for children, centre managers agree they should support teachers to:</p><p> </p><ul>
<li>be more explicit about the ways they extend children’s learning</li>
<li>strengthen programme planning to include the specific teaching strategies they will use to promote children’s learning dispositions</li>
<li>integrate literacy and numeracy in more meaningful contexts as part of children’s play</li>
<li>evaluate the effectiveness of the learning programme</li>
<li>strengthen whānau involvement in the assessment of children’s learning</li>
<li>support children’s transitions from the centre by strengthening relationships with a range of local primary schools.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>ERO and centre managers also agreed that next steps include:</p><p> </p><ul>
<li>developing the outdoor play areas</li>
<li>developing strategic and annual plans to guide centre operations and systems</li>
<li>improving the documentation of self-review processes at management level, including refining Trust policies so they are more site specific and aligned with centre operations and practice</li>
<li>linking monthly reports to the Trust more directly on progress made in meeting the centre’s strategic goals.</li>
</ul><p> </p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Homai Nga Taonga Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Homai Nga Taonga Early Childhood Centre will be in three years. </p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>10 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/how-ero-reviews/how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services-and-schools/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
