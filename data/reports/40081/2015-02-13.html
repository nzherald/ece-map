</table><p>Lynmore Playcentre requires further development. The centre has worked hard to rebuild centre membership and develop strong management and administrative systems. It is now important that centre members improve their understanding of the learning and teaching aspects of the Playcentre philosophy so that they can make the most of the opportunities the playcentre experience potentially provides.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lynmore Playcentre is located in the Rotorua suburb of Lynmore and caters for children up to six years of age. It is licensed for 30 children, including up to 20 children under the age of two years. At the time of this ERO review, 16 families and 24 children were enrolled, of whom 2 identify as Māori. It currently provides 2 family sessions on Monday and Friday mornings. The centre is located in a purpose built facility with multi level outdoor spaces that have been well developed to provide stimulating and challenging areas for children to explore. The centre has recently experienced roll growth as a result of strengthened management and communication.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of the Rotorua Playcentre Association. The association strongly endorses playcentre philosophy, and aims to empower parents to be the first and best educators of their children. It expects that parents will act as volunteer leaders and managers for their playcentre. The association employs staff to provide them with guidance and support. The knowledgeable operations manager is readily available to assist with information, and an experienced centre support officer attends playcentre sessions and meetings to advise and mentor members. The association receives reports from the support officer and that provide assurance of compliance with licensing, health and safety and other operational requirements.</p><p>Playcentres offer a recognised adult education qualification designed to assist parents to provide appropriate learning opportunities for their children. The association offers training towards this qualification for all members. In addition the association recently provided professional development through a Ministry of Education contract. An experienced tutor assisted the association and its centres to use self-review process to promote and evaluate its strategic goals.</p><p>Through its strategic plan, the association provides a framework for centres to set goals to guide their operation and development. These relate to their Tiriti o Waitangi commitment, the vibrancy of their communities of learning, their recognition of the wider community, and their sustainable future.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five reviews in the Rotorua Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are actively engaged in a wide range of play and activity. They are able to follow their own interests, and are supported to make their own choices and develop independence. Children have ready access to an extensive variety of resources, both inside and outside, that cater for different age groups. Well planned and developed outdoor play areas give children opportunities to take reasonable risks and extend their capabilities.</p><p>The centre is well resourced, including those learning tools which support mathematics and literacy development such as rulers, levels and books. ERO observed some examples of children being supported to develop concepts of number, pattern and measurement. Children enjoy lively discussions and activities related to books they have read. Centre leaders have worked hard to develop a culture whereby all children benefit from the diverse skills and experiences of all parents in the centre, not just their own.</p><p>Centre members celebrate children’s cultural diversity by including celebrations such as Matariki, Diwali, Easter and Christmas in the centre programme. Morning tea is used to welcome newcomers, celebrate children’s milestones, share things of interest and discuss items of the day. It is used effectively for supporting children’s social interactions and developing a family atmosphere.</p><p>A planning system is in place which encourages and supports participation by parents. Children’s activities are recorded in portfolios and wall displays, celebrate children’s participation, and promote their sense of identity and belonging.</p><p>Current position holders have formed a strong team committed to the playcentre philosophy and vision. They have worked hard to increase roll numbers and ensure that all new members feel welcome. They actively support parents participating in playcentre early childhood training. Parents comment positively about the good communication systems that centre leaders have developed. These have increased parents’ sense of inclusion and involvement.</p><p>Centre leaders are developing an understanding of self review. Informal and spontaneous self review occurs at monthly management meetings.</p><p>The association provides support and guidance, and is readily available to answer questions and offer advice. The centre support officer visits regularly to monitor compliance, provide feedback about centre practices, and maintain communication between the centre and the association.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Having worked effectively to build centre numbers and develop strong management practices, centre leaders and ERO agree it is now appropriate to focus on developing new parent understanding of how children learn through play. This will include:</p><ul>
<li>developing strategies that support parents to identify their children’s learning and to add complexity</li>
<li>modelling intentional interactions which extend children’s learning and play.</li>
</ul><p>It is also necessary to develop a more effective assessment culture through:</p><ul>
<li>ensuring appropriate tools such as printers, templates and cameras are readily available, maintained and consistently used</li>
<li>developing strategies which make writing learning stories manageable for busy parents</li>
<li>utilising centre strengths to model how to write concise, effective learning stories that identify learning and possible next steps.</li>
</ul><p>Self review requires strengthening. It needs to focus more on children’s learning and development. It should be regular, formal, well documented and linked to strategic planning.</p><p>The association has agreed that recognising and celebrating the learning for both adults and children is an essential part of valuing the ‘Playcentre experience’. Adding a goal to the association and centre strategic plans for identifying and building on programme successes would focus attention on the quality of learning opportunities and outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lynmore Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>During the course of the review ERO identified an area of non-compliance. To meet requirements the service needs to:</p><ul>
<li>Ensure heavy furniture, fixtures and equipment that could fall or topple and cause serious injury or damage is secured.</li>
</ul><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, Criterion HS 5]</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lynmore Playcentre will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>13 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
