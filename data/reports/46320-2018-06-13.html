</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Cubbyhouse Early Childhood Centre is one of a cluster of four private early childhood centres under common ownership. It is licensed for a maximum of 110 children, including 40 aged up to two years. Of the 142 children enrolled, 18 identify as Māori. Children learn in four separate rooms with shared areas.</p><p>The two owners/directors have oversight of personnel and financial management. Responsibility for day-to-day operation and curriculum implementation is delegated to a manager. Each classroom is overseen by a team leader. Of the 22 permanently kaiako (teachers) employed, 14 are registered.</p><p>The philosophy underpinning teaching and learning emphasises the importance of relationships, acknowledgement of New Zealand’s dual cultural heritage, creativity and child-initiated play.</p><p>The January 2015 ERO report identified the need to further develop: processes to build the quality of teaching and learning, including the appraisal process; the bicultural programme and ways to work with Māori learners; self review; assessment; and annual planning.</p><p>This review is one of a cluster of four in the Cubbyhouse umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The curriculum strongly reflects the values outlined in the centre's philosophy statement. Children are active, engaged learners who are well supported by kaiako to settle into and persevere in their play. Trusting relationships are evident with their kaiako. The teaching team has an enduring focus on the development of partnerships with parents and whānau to strengthen support for children's learning.</p><p>Kaiako are working to implement practices that promote children's independence, self management and empowerment as learners. The outdoor environment is carefully planned to encourage exploration and challenge. Routines are flexible and children are offered choices about decisions that affect them. Resources are presented to promote their interest, participation and creative self-expression. Children display strong ownership of the environment.</p><p>Provision for infants is well developed. Consistent caregiving supports secure and trusting relationships between children and adults. Key kaiako are attuned to children's cues and effectively promote their sustained engagement in play and learning. Infants display a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing. They are confident and independent learners.</p><p>A thoughtful approach has been taken to the development of a bicultural perspective in the programme, and of practices that should support Māori children's success as Māori. A range of research and publications have been considered. Kaiako have recently incorporated Māori values in children's learning summaries, and acknowledgment of te ao Māori in internal evaluation and planning processes. Aspects of tikanga are a regular part of the daily programme. Links are being developed with whānau Māori to support the team's approach.</p><p>Children requiring additional learning support are identified and assisted to participate fully in the programme. Planning processes consider the impact of the programme on these learners. Kaiako work collaboratively with outside agencies, parents and whānau to identify and progress children's learning goals.</p><p>Children’s transitions into and through the service are carefully considered. Kaiako and families work together to plan an approach that maintains children's relationships and promotes their wellbeing.</p><p>Support is provided to assist children's transition to school. Information about local schools is made available to parents. Relationships between centre staff and some local school personnel are developing. Leaders should continue to seek ways to share information with school personnel to support the continuity of children’s learning.</p><p>A comprehensive approach to planning the programme is in place, linked to children's interests and parents' and whānau aspirations. Use of an online program supports improved communication between kaiako and families about aspects of children's learning. Assessment records show that some kaiako are putting in place strategies to support the progress of individual children over time. The team should: work on maximising the focus on outcomes for individual children to effectively support decision making about next learning/teaching steps; and continue to seek ways of supporting children's timely and ongoing reflection on their learning and achievement.</p><p>A well-established approach to review and development is in place. Inquiry and research into aspects of practice are undertaken by all kaiako. Reflection and collaboration are strong features of the team's approach. Understanding and use of internal evaluation is developing. A suitable framework has been adopted. Its effective use, including identification of indicators of high quality to support decision making about development and collection of relevant evidence, is a next step.</p><p>A collaborative, collegial team culture is in place, supported by distributed leadership opportunities. The manager has an inclusive and improvement-focused approach clearly centred on children and sound philosophical values linked to teaching and learning.</p><p>Good support is available for kaiako and leaders to develop their practice. The appraisal process continues to evolve. The manager has made plans to ensure:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>regular, formal observations of practice are undertaken in relation to kaiako goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evidence of kaiako practice is relevant and clearly demonstrates progress towards goals and teaching standards.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Some well-aligned governance and management processes support improvement in practice and operation over time. Regular management reports provides assurance that expectations for operation are being met. Leaders work collaboratively to identify and progress strategic priorities. Next steps at governance level are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review the overarching Cubbyhouse philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish a planned approach to implementation of a bicultural perspective across the Cubbyhouse organisation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop the strategic framework to better define goals, actions and desired outcomes, and strengthen alignment with teacher development and planned internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the director and manager agree the priority at centre level is to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>planning for learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>At governance level priorities are to support development of</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a strategic approach to implementing Te Tiriti-based practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>understanding and use of internal evaluation at all levels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the teacher appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an improved strategic planning framework to promote sustainability of operation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Cubbyhouse Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Cubbyhouse Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>13 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
