</table><p>St Mary's Early Childhood Education Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>St Mary’s Early Childhood Education Centre is a well-established early learning service located in Karori, Wellington. Full day education and care is offered for 30 children, including 10 aged up to two years. The centre serves a culturally diverse community.</p><p>The head teacher, appointed in 2016, works collaboratively with a committee made up of parent and Karori Anglican Church representatives to organise operation of the service, including responsibility for financial management. Most teachers are fully qualified.</p><p>A number of initiatives are being put in place to strengthen teaching and learning opportunities. A centre chaplain has been employed to plan and implement Christian learning experiences.</p><p>ERO's February 2016 report identified several areas in need of significant development. These included: assessment; internal evaluation; strategic and annual planning; governance and management practices; professional development and appraisal. Strategic staff appointments are supporting ongoing progress.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Staff have built a strong sense of community with whānau. Well-considered transition processes are in place. Excursions into the surrounding neighbourhood support children's sense of place and belonging. They benefit from opportunities to learn about gardening and environmental sustainability. Children with diverse learning needs are well supported, in close liaison with families and external agencies.</p><p>Leadership demonstrates a clear commitment to growing teacher capability and improving the programme for children. A range of strategies promote teachers' professional learning and development. ERO and centre leaders agree that continuing to support teachers to work on embedding a child-led curriculum that maximises opportunities for learning and for children to engage in sustained play is an ongoing priority. In addition, encouraging teachers to give greater consideration to how they can further develop children's independence skills and social competence particularly through routine times is an area for further development.</p><p>Teachers are building their understanding and use of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori, with leadership support. Bicultural perspectives are emerging in the programme. ERO and leaders agree that this is an area requiring continued focus.</p><p>The introduction of an online platform for sharing assessment is supporting timely input and communication with parents, and the documentation of learning. Monthly assessments outline children's progress and possible next development steps. Children’s learning is often well articulated. Further improving assessment, planning and evaluation documentation is a key next step for the service. This should involve:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>showing clearly how teachers are purposefully progressing individual children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>better reflecting the integration of children's culture, language and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistently documenting how parent aspirations have been responded to.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The teaching team is being supported to think more deeply about their practice, and reflect on a good range of pedagogical theory and research. Teachers regularly discuss the effectiveness of the programme. Leaders and teachers should continue to review teacher practice to inform ongoing improvements.</p><p>A collaborative appraisal process, linked to the Teaching Council's <em>Standards for the Teaching Profession,</em> is now in place. Leadership provides good critique and models high expectations to improve practice. Some strengthening of appraisal goals, so that they are measurable would add value to this process. In addition, documentation of the head teacher's appraisal should be improved.</p><p>Good governance practices are now evident. Members work well together. An appropriate range of policies guides practice and operation. Managers and teachers feel well supported by the committee and church. Parents' and teachers' input is sought and valued. Strategic and financial information is appropriately shared with families.</p><p>A useful approach to long-term planning is in place to provide direction for teaching, learning and operation. Management committee members are well informed about the work of the centre through head teacher reports, which include management plan updates.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers should continue to focus on the following priorities. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>embedding a child-led curriculum that enhances children's independence and social competence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop assessment, planning and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further integrating children's cultures, languages and identities in documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of St Mary's Early Childhood Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice, the service should:</p><ul>
<li>ensure that risk management systems meet all requirements of the <em>Health and Safety at Work Act 2015</em> and relevant licensing criteria.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of St Mary's Early Childhood Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>7 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
