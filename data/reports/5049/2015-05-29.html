</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Flatbush Kindergarten serves a multicultural community in Otara, Auckland. The children come from Māori and a diverse range of Pacific backgrounds. The Samoan culture is predominant. The kindergarten offers a Kindergarten Day Model of six hour days. The kindergarten is licensed to provide for up to 40 children, with the majority being from three to five years of age.</p><p>The kindergarten team is made up of four registered teachers, including the head teacher, one support staff member, and an administrator. Teachers have opportunities to share leadership roles. They have well-established relationships with families and the local community. The team acknowledges the historical background of the Ngai Tai rohe and are learning about Pacific communities.</p><p>The teaching team has sustained most of the positive features highlighted in ERO’s 2012 report and is reviewing the effectiveness of others. The report recommended that teachers develop strategies to support children’s understanding and use of the English language. ERO also recommended that teachers could extend the complexity of children’s play. Teachers have engaged in professional development to help them respond to these recommendations.</p><p>The kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA), which provides considered leadership, a management framework, support personnel and a programme of professional development for teachers.</p><p>After extensive review, consultation and development, the AKA has recently launched a new 10-year strategic direction. Its four strategic pillars or objectives relate to educational excellence, core organisational processes, community engagement and a future focus. These objectives are intended to guide the AKA and its’ kindergartens in their ongoing development. The AKA’s approach to rolling out a substantial change in its organisational structure has been carefully considered.</p><p>New AKA roles have been established to provide more targeted support for kindergarten operations, curriculum and development. Professional development is planned to support kindergarten head teachers in their leadership and management roles. A Quality Improvement Process (QIP) is being developed and will be implemented to monitor quality in kindergartens and contribute to self review and ongoing improvement.</p><p>This review is one of a cluster of ten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the centre and are often greeted in their home languages. Teachers develop meaningful relationships with new children and their families as they transition into the kindergarten. Parents are happy to stay to help their children settle and are eager to participate in kindergarten events and celebrations. Teachers are considering strategies to encourage parents to work more closely in partnership with them to benefit children’s learning.</p><p>Children are engaged and busy in the programme. Imaginative play is encouraged and provides opportunities for children to extend their social skills. Some older children observe the teachers’ affirming social interactions and are incorporating these skills effectively in their own conversations.</p><p>Children actively plan for their own learning. They work alongside teachers, identify topics that they want to learn more about, and use computer tools and resource books to gather in-depth information about their interest. They are also learning how to assess the progress they make in their learning. Teachers are reviewing the planning, assessment and evaluation processes used to support children’s learning. Portfolios provide good evidence of children’s individual progress over time.</p><p>The promotion of language development and thinking skills is evident. Many of the children are learning how to speak English. Teachers are beginning to use words and phrases from children’s’ home languages to help them understand English. They are also committed to learning more about children’s family backgrounds to help children to retain their languages, cultures and sense of identity.</p><p>The environment is attractively presented and well resourced. Teachers and children can easily select additional resources from orderly storage areas. Areas of play have been enriched to support numeracy, literacy and science learning. Wall displays are used to make planning more visible to families and children. Teachers’ growing commitment to bicultural practice is reflected in the kindergarten environment. The history of the mana whenua is featured along with the <em>Tiriti O Waitangi</em>, and Māori learning resources and other taonga.</p><p>Parents are beginning to give feedback to staff about their aspirations for their children, and to share their children’s learning experiences at home or in their community. Teachers plan to use this information to reinforce and extend children’s learning. They are also considering ways to further encourage family participation in supporting their children’s learning.</p><p>The kindergarten’s vision, philosophy and well-considered annual plans are clearly linked. Teachers are beginning to use quality indicators to help evaluate their teaching practices. Research, shared readings and professional learning are helping teachers to continue improving the quality of teaching and learning.</p><p>AKA systems for monitoring and promoting improvement in kindergarten operations are well established. A variety of useful systems and processes contribute to the teaching team’s increasingly robust self review. This self review is both responsive and planned, is supported by research into best practice, and reflects teachers’ focus on continual professional development. It often results in improvements. It is timely now for teachers to raise the level of critique of their teaching practice, and more specifically identify outcomes for children as part of their self review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include teachers continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>learn more about mana whenua history</li>
<li>evaluate the impact of teachers’ use of te reo Māori and Pacific languages</li>
<li>include parent’s cultural knowledge, language, customs and values in children's portfolios</li>
<li>help parents to understand how they can contribute to their children's’ learning</li>
<li>more frequently evaluate individual children’s learning and progress.</li>
</ul><p>These next steps should affirm children in their cultures and as capable and competent learners</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Flatbush Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Flatbush Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>29 May 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
