</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Oaks Early Learning Centre (Alexandra) Ltd is a stand-alone privately-owned centre. It has been operating for 18 months. The centre is staffed by a mixture of qualified ECE teachers and untrained staff with one staff member in training. Each room is led by a trained teacher. This is the first ERO report for the centre.</p><p>Children learn and play happily at the centre. They are divided into three open-plan rooms generally grouped by age and children’s readiness for the next stage of learning. Transitions from room to room are made when children feel ready for the change.</p><p>The centre has responded to the wishes of the community and provides all meals. They have achieved a bronze healthy heart award for the food provided.</p><p>Also in response to the community wishes, the centre aims to provide affordable, high quality, all-day care and education where siblings can be together.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The owners and teachers have had an appropriate priority on establishing positive partnerships with children, families and the community. They have developed a strong foundation for operating a new centre. They have identified that they are now ready to further develop the strategic plan and annual plan. They also need to focus on further developing systems to ensure the continued smooth operation of the centre. These systems include implementing the new appraisal system, developing a suitable process for the induction of new staff, and attending to some aspects of health and safety.</p><p>The team has made a good start to reviewing the effectiveness of their programmes and practices. The owners and teachers have developed shared understandings of the purpose and processes of self review. The next step is to ensure self review measures how well their practice supports positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Owners and teachers have developed a useful shared philosophy that guides what they do for children and how they do it. A qualified teacher provides appropriate support and guidance for the</p><p>staff-in-training in each room. The owners provide support for ongoing, effective professional development for all staff. Staff members work well together as a team. They appreciate how each person’s ideas and input are valued.</p><p>Teachers aim for children to develop positive relationships with others. Children take risks, experience literacy and numeracy in the daily programme, and relate well to one another. Teachers consistently support children to manage themselves and be independent. Teachers sensitively manage transitions within the centre and into the centre.</p><p>Through professional development and the self-review programme, teachers have explored how to better plan for and assess children’s learning. They have made a good start to this. ERO found some very good examples of individual planning and assessment within the centre. Leaders now need to explore how to make this common practice across the whole centre and ensure it continues.</p><p>Children’s interests are used as a starting point for developing group plans. They enjoy a wide range of interesting activities and outings into the local community. Children are learning about New Zealand’s bicultural heritage. They hear te reo Māori throughout the day and Māori content and tikanga are included in the curriculum.</p><p>Very good relationships are evident between staff and children, staff and parents and amongst the staff. ERO observed caring, warm, respectful interactions. Children show a strong sense of belonging to the centre. They know and understand the routines, participate in these and know the expectations for behaviour. They are encouraged to be independent.</p><p>The well-designed inside area allows children to move and play easily inside and out. They use a range of natural materials and other resources to support their interests. As a new centre, resources are being purchased in response to children’s emerging needs and interests.</p><p>Under-two year old infants enjoy nurturing, caring, responsive interactions with adults.</p><p>The group size is deliberately kept small to enable children to settle and be secure.</p><p>The programme is designed to respond to infants’ needs and to extend their learning. This includes fostering children’s independence, empathy and care for each other, and exploration. Teachers manage care routines very well.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>As a new centre, the owners have identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>consolidate and embed systems for self review, planning and assessment, some aspects of health and safety and systems for the smooth operation of the centre</li>
<li>develop strategic planning to guide the future direction of the centre.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Oaks Early Learning Centre (Alexandra) Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities </li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>While on-site, ERO found the following aspects of health and safety needed to be improved.</p><ul>
<li>The risk analysis management needs more detail about what adults will do to ensure children’s safety while away from the centre</li>
<li>The medication documentation needs to include an expectation that parents will sign to acknowledge medication had been given to their child</li>
<li>Earthquake drills need to be recorded</li>
<li>Records of accidents need to be analysed for trends and patterns in an ongoing way.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Oaks Early Learning Centre (Alexandra) Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>1 July 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
