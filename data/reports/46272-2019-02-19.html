</table><p>Coast Montessori Preschool is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Coast Montessori Preschool is one of two centres with the same licensee. It is located in the township of Silverdale, Auckland, in purpose-built premises. The owner's other centre is located in Kumeu. The centre employs a culturally diverse staff.</p><p>The centre is licensed to provide sessional and full-day education and care for 45 children over two years of age. Children share the indoor space, and have free access to the outdoor area for much of the day. Most children who attend the centre are Pākehā. There are six Māori children, and the ethnicities of other children include Chinese and Korean.</p><p>Coast Montessori's philosophy and approach to children's education is consistent with the teaching of Maria Montessori, while acknowledging the intentions of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Partnership with parents and the wider community is valued.</p><p>The owners operate the centre with the support of a head teacher. They take a keen interest in the management of the centre, and in children's education and care.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report noted the positive relationships and interactions that children experienced, and opportunities that they had to build their literacy and numeracy knowledge. The report also affirmed the support provided for children with additional needs, information sharing with parents, assessment and planning processes, and management systems. These continue to be strengths of the centre. The report suggested that staff strengthen bicultural practices and the documenting of strategic planning. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children continue to benefit from positive and supportive relationships with staff. Teachers support children's emotional wellbeing, and very skilfully support their learning by using questions and suggestions to extend their thinking. Children with additional needs are well catered for in the inclusive environment.</p><p>Teaching practice is consistent with the centre's philosophy. Teachers have strong curriculum knowledge and know the children and their families well. They allow children to make decisions about their play and help them to access resources. Teachers promote tuakana/teina relationships by encouraging children to help each other with tasks.</p><p>The environment is well organised and resourced, and presented in ways that encourage children's curiosity and engagement. A wide range of equipment, including specific Montessori curriculum resources, is available in the indoor and outdoor areas. Children work with the equipment individually or with friends. Teachers are available to support the children in their play-based learning.</p><p>Staff have made good progress extending bicultural practice in the programme. Good use is made of individual teachers' knowledge and interests to support this aspect of the curriculum. Teachers take leadership roles to build their knowledge and confidence in using aspects of te reo and tikanga Māori. The centre has developed meaningful links with the local marae. Staff share aspects of Māori culture with the families that attend the centre.</p><p>Transitions into the centre and to school are well managed. Children and their parents are supported to feel confident about their transition to school. The centre has built positive relationships with the local schools, and teachers visit them regularly.</p><p>Managers provide time each day for teachers to reflect on the progress children are making, and to plan for children's next learning steps. Programme planning is well documented. It reflects the detailed information about children's learning that teachers regularly record and share electronically with families. Parents are encouraged to contribute to these records, and they often talk informally about the children with teachers.</p><p>Centre managers set high standards for all aspects of the centre's operation, and together with teachers they collaborate to meet these standards. Ongoing improvement is supported by a strong appraisal system, the provision of relevant and significant professional learning, and effective internal evaluation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To provide an even stronger focus for improvement and monitoring purposes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers could make greater use of evaluative questions to guide their review of centre practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strategic planning would be strengthened by writing clear strategic goals that are shared with staff.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Coast Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Coast Montessori Preschool will be in four years.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>19 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
