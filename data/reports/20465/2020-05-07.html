</table><p class="title sixteen columns clearfix" id="page-title">Kindercare Learning Centres (10 B, T &amp; P) Constellation is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres (10 B, T &amp; P) Constellation is part of national early learning service owned and operated by Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd (the organisation). It is on the same site as the Kindercare Learning Centres (10P) Constellation. This centre is licensed for 147 children, including 40 children under two years of age. Families and teachers represent a diverse range of cultures and ethnic groups.</p><p>The centre is part of a large complex that provides care and education from children from birth to five-years-old in age-specific rooms, with access to shared outdoor spaces. It has charitable connections with the Gracegate centre and Care4Kids, that support children and their families. The centre has a long-standing teaching team with low staff turnover. Most teachers are qualified and registered ECE teachers.</p><p>The service philosophy is based on Kindercares' three key values for children to be ‘safe, loved and learning’. The organisation provides policies, procedures and processes to monitor health and safety. An area manager works in partnership with the centre director to support centre operation. The organisation has developed service-wide expectations and a strategic approach to understanding te ao Maori and culturally responsive practices.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have maintained the positive aspects identified in the April 2015 ERO report. They have worked together to further enhance partnerships with parents; and continued to develop capable, confident leaders and teachers who can achieve their potential and contribute to positive outcomes for children.</p><p>This review was one of five within Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd, Auckland region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders and teachers have embedded a strong shared, vision and values that are very well reflected in practices. They promote a culture of care and respect for one another and for children, parents and whānau. Positive and supportive relationships are actively fostered to create a strong sense of belonging for children.</p><p>Teachers work in partnership with parents and whānau. They value parent contribution to the programme and to their children's learning. Effective communication systems ensure that parents are well informed of their children's learning. Transitions into and within the centre and on to school, are personalised to the needs of each child.</p><p>Teachers provide a rich, broad curriculum that provokes children’s deeper levels of interest, oral language development, self-confidence and social competence. Children have many opportunities to investigate and extend their ideas and contribute to a curriculum that is highly responsive to their interests, strengths and capabilities. Teachers are very intentional in the planning and presentation of the environment to inspire children's curiosity, creativity and exploration. Literacy, mathematics and science are integrated in ways that are meaningful for children. Purposeful links to schools and the community enhance learning for children.</p><p>Diverse learners are well supported to see themselves as capable learners. Leaders and teachers take collective responsibility for children's wellbeing and learning. Teachers work closely with parents, whānau and external agencies. The organisation prioritises equitable opportunities to learn for all children. They provide additional resourcing and family support expertise, when required, to help children succeed.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from a curriculum of care and respect, and the purposeful provision of separate, high quality environments. Teachers give emphasis to providing an ‘atmosphere of quiet care' especially for young infants. They are mindful of supporting a positive sense of wellbeing and security for children. Teachers work in partnership with parents and whānau to provide respectful routines and rituals that are aligned to home rhythms.</p><p>Strong effective leadership has established a culture in which children are valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning. Leaders have very clear expectations for effective teaching and learning outcomes for children. The leadership team provide high levels of professional support, including targeted professional development and mentoring, to strengthen teacher capability and leadership capacity. They promote a culture of inquiry and reflection, and critical thinking for leaders, teachers and children. Leaders and teachers work collaboratively, valuing and making good use of individual strengths and the skills of parents to enhance the curriculum.</p><p>The organisation has established a strategic approach that is well aligned to service priorities and the professional learning and development of teachers. Governance and management practices are underpinned by a strong, shared, vision and purpose. There is a clear focus on building leadership and promoting robust appraisal and mentoring processes to promote ongoing improvement and positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Service leaders have identified, and ERO's evaluation has confirmed, that the key next steps are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><span lang="mi">te ao Māori</span> and bicultural perspectives in key documentation and practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>home language and cultures in curriculum documentation and practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO identified that the annual strategic plan could be reviewed and refined to provide a clear process for monitoring, evaluating and reporting on key strategic priorities.</p><p>The organisation priorities are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>give greater prominence to the principles of The Treaty of <span lang="mi">Waitangi</span> in key documentation and teaching practices, including fully implementing the organisation's <span lang="mi">te ao Māori</span> and culturally responsive practice action planning, across the service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refine strategic planning and ensure clear alignment of internal evaluation, monitoring and reporting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate effectiveness of leadership, management and governance.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centre (10 B, T &amp; P) Constellation completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement</p><p><span lang="mi">Te Tai Tini</span> (Southern Region)</p><p>7 May 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
