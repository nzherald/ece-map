</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres (10 B, T &amp; P) Constellation is part of a large complex that provides care and education for children from birth to five years of age. It opened in 1993 and is situated in Mairangi Bay, Auckland. The community attending the centre is predominately NZ European/Pākehā and Chinese. A small number of children are Māori and from other ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in February 2012, the complex has merged from four licenses to two. There has also been a significant focus around strengthening learning partnerships with families and whānau.</p><p>The centre philosophy and vision guides and underpins all practices and developments at the centre. The philosophy reflects early childhood as a precious stage in life; a time when significant adults build connections and prioritise keeping children ‘safe, loved and learning’. Teachers work together with parents to celebrate and help develop each child’s full potential.</p><p>The Kindercare umbrella organisation provides the centre with management and administration systems, including a policy and procedural framework. The area manager, centre director and centre supervisor/curriculum support person provide high quality governance and effective professional leadership. All staff play a significant role in sustaining and further developing positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre’s philosophy and values are well reflected in practice and underpinned by positive and respectful relationships. Children and parents are warmly welcomed when they arrive. This helps children settle quickly into the centre and play. Teachers’ caring, unhurried interactions with children promote children’s sense of self esteem and foster their belonging.</p><p>An atmosphere of quiet care, and opportunities for children to move freely within the centre support individual exploration and physical movement, particularly for infants and toddlers. Teachers’ engagement with children and the parent community underpins a programme focused on the interests of children and parent aspirations.</p><p>The outdoor area is particularly inviting for children. It offers them a range of equipment and play options designed to capture their interests and meet their learning needs. There are good opportunities for children to explore science and nature themes. Play options are offered to develop children’s physical coordination, strength and agility. Children can construct and create art, explore and enjoy quiet natural spaces. ERO observed many individual children and groups of children happily engaged in sustained imaginative and creative play.</p><p>The centre’s innovative curriculum focuses on an ‘ethos of care’. It reflects a deep level of respect for each child and their individuality. The flexibility of learning programmes enables children to play and develop at their own pace and follow their own interests. They also give children assurance that they are valued and uniquely special. Most teachers skilfully extend children’s thinking through careful and responsive questioning. These approaches enable teachers to extend the curriculum and grow children’s sense of resilience.</p><p>Stories about children’s learning are well documented on the recently introduced <em>Educa</em> web based programme. Parents receive current information about their children’s experiences and learning. This enables parents to follow up and extend children’s learning at home. Parents can also share children’s emerging interests with teachers. This has helped create a richer partnership with parents and to increase their contribution to their child’s learning.</p><p>The centre has made considerable developments to the bicultural dimensions of its programme. This is a result of tapping into the considerable knowledge and skills of its parent/whānau community. Strengths in this area include the:</p><ul>
<li>fostering of bicultural learning at an organisational, teacher and parent level</li>
<li>use of the Awataha Marae to enrich staff learning experiences and opportunities for bicultural leadership</li>
<li>welcoming their Guardian, Haumiatiketike sculpture to their gardens.</li>
</ul><p>The centre now has a good platform for further growth. Building on these strengths, leaders and teachers plan to review the curriculum and teacher practices with the aim of further increasing the centre’s bicultural capability.</p><p>The centre benefits from highly capable leadership and collaborative team work. Centre leaders and teachers participate in effective ongoing professional development to learn about current best practice in early childhood education. They make appropriate use of up-to-date information and research, along with reflection and evaluation of their practices, to continue to deliver high quality care and education for children.</p><p>The area manager, centre director and centre supervisor/curriculum support person capably guide the centre’s strategic direction. They promote high expectations, and support teachers to meet these expectations. The policy framework and management planning are sound. Centre self review is rigorous, systematic, and well documented. It focuses on improvement and invites parent contributions and feedback.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have appropriately identified that the next stages of centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>further enhancing partnerships with parents</li>
<li>continuing to develop capable, confident leaders and teachers who can achieve their potential and contribute positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres (10 B, T &amp; P) Constellation completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres (10 B, T &amp; P) Constellation will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>10 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
