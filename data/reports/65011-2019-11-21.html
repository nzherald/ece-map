</table><p>Riccarton Park Montessori Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Riccarton Park Montessori Preschool is a small privately-owned service licensed for 27 children over the age of two years.</p><p>The centre philosophy, based on Montessori principles, aims to provide children with a calm well-structured learning environment with a focus on early literacy and mathematics.</p><p>The teaching team and many of the children are from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds. There are a number of children with additional learning needs.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn in a calm well-organised environment. They easily access a wide range of experiences and high-quality resources designed to support and extend their learning and development. The programme combines <em>Te Whāriki</em>- <em>the Early childhood curriculum</em> with a Montessori curriculum. Children follow their interests and the choice of activities provides sufficient challenge to keep children meaningfully engaged. The centre's priorities for children's learning include literacy and maths and these are a key focus of the daily programme. Science learning is also well supported.</p><p>Teachers know children well and have positive relationships with them and their families. Parents and family members often contribute their unique skills and knowledge to the programme. Routines are well established and teachers' expectations for learning and positive participation are well understood by the children. These contribute to children's sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>Teachers purposefully integrate parent aspirations for their children's learning into the daily programme. Children's profile books show that agreed goals and the strategies teachers plan to use to promote learning are being implemented. Children's learning is closely monitored and their progress is regularly shared with parents.</p><p>The cultural diversity of families within the centre is highly valued and regularly celebrated. Most of the teachers are fluent in languages other than English. They help support children with English as their second language to settle quickly and understand what is happening around them. Teachers are pro-active in securing extra support for children with additional needs and promptly seek external support when required. Regular involvement of a speech language therapist is making a significant difference to children's learning and building teachers' capabilities in this area.</p><p>Teachers appropriately integrate te ao Māori practices into the daily programme and regularly use te reo Māori. Children and teachers are confident with their current knowledge of te reo Māori and enthusiastic about learning more. It is timely to develop a planned approach to this learning to ensure the gains are maintained and built upon over time.</p><p>Teachers follow a useful transition procedure to support children coming into the centre and when leaving to attend school.</p><p>There are high expectations for teaching and learning. The leader has begun to implement a shared leadership approach with the team. They work well together with a shared vision and commitment to ensuring all children have their learning and wellbeing needs met.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are focused on continuous improvement. They stay current with changes in regulations and theories about teaching and learning. They engage in regular professional development and new learning is shared and put into practice.</p><p>A strategic plan gives good guidance for the future development of the centre with a clear focus on children's wellbeing and learning. It would be useful to review the strategic and annual plan to show more specifically how the goals will be met and progress monitored during each year.</p><p>Recent external professional development on internal evaluation provided an opportunity for the team to review practice while also ensuring alignment with the philosophy and beliefs about learning. Planned reviews are comprehensive and evaluation topics are investigated thoroughly. Changes implemented as a result of these reviews are having a positive impact on outcomes for children. The development of the review schedule and inclusion of the service's key priorities for children's learning may help maintain the focus of each review, to ensure the things that impact most on children are reviewed regularly.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO's evaluation confirms and the owner agrees that the next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ongoing development and review of assessment and planning processes and strengthening the visibility of children's cultures in documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to refine and use internal evaluation processes to evaluate the quality of programmes and practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>planning ways to sustain and grow te reo Māori learning and the integration of Māori perspectives across the service.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Riccarton Park Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>21 November 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
