</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Opotiki Playcentre is a parent-led early childhood service located in central Opotiki. The playcentre caters for children from birth to school age from a range of different ethnic backgrounds. It is licensed for 30 children including 15 up to the age of two. There are two morning sessions each week and a recently introduced, independent session for three to five year olds on Wednesday mornings. At the time of this ERO review there were 20 children on the roll, five of whom identify as Māori. Since the 2012 ERO review, the roll has increased, parent education has grown, and there have been significant improvements to the resources and indoor environment. Leadership roles and responsibilities have been clarified and strengthened, communication has improved, and the learning for children has been made more visible through assessment and planning processes. The Māori world view and respect for other cultures is strongly promoted within the playcentre.</p><p>Many parents are completing their playcentre course qualifications and a life member attends most sessions, providing support and guidance. Leadership roles are well distributed amongst parent members.</p><p>The centre philosophy is aligned to the playcentre philosophy that empowers adults and children to work, play, learn and grow together. The playcentre provides a safe, nurturing and stimulating environment that supports families and fosters life-long friendships.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight playcentre reviews in the Eastern Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Relationships amongst children and parents are positive, supportive and respectful. The learning environment reflects the social and cultural values and beliefs of children and their families. Parents are committed to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the principle of partnership. They celebrate other cultures represented at the centre and promote an inclusive environment.</p><p>Children lead their play and make choices from a wide range of attractively presented resources and activities. Parents follow their children’s interests and join them in imaginary play. They extend children’s learning and inquiry through questions, supportive comments, and provide appropriate resources. Children were playing either cooperatively with others, or happily engaging in sustained play on their own.</p><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging in the playcentre. They are confident communicators and have opportunities to hear te reo Māori spoken. They engage in activities that promote literacy and mathematics, science and creative arts, and use their physical skills to explore the spacious outdoor environment.</p><p>Parents are constantly reviewing and improving the learning areas to enhance learning and play opportunities for children. Their voices and contributions are actively sought through monthly meetings, session planning, parent surveys, and informal discussions. The parent leader responsible for education is encouraging more parents to engage in workshops provided by the Playcentre Association.</p><p>Parents are increasing their skills at noticing, recognising and responding to children’s interests and inquiries. They reflect on learning and play activities that have occurred at the end of each session and record their observations. They use these to help write learning stories and inform future planning. Centre leaders now agree that a next step is to identify the learning that is happening for individual children during their session discussions, and ensure that their learning pathways are made clear throughout the planning process.</p><p>Centre leaders benefit from the knowledge and experience of a life member who is also the association president. Over the last two years they have had a deliberate focus on building collaborative and cooperative relationships that have facilitated improved organisation and communication. They have reviewed leadership roles to encourage new members to participate in leadership responsibilities and have also changed meeting times resulting in increased attendance and participation at meetings. Centre leaders now acknowledge that next steps are to create more opportunities for parents to form supportive friendships in a social setting, and to promote playcentre membership in the wider community.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation provides overall guidance, support and strategic direction for the local association and centres. The Eastern Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association aims to grow and sustain parent membership and is proactive in supporting local events and activities. There are clear policies, procedures and guidelines for self review, assessment, planning and evaluation. Playcentre workshops help parents establish strategies and practices that ensure positive educational outcomes for children.</p><p>At the time of this ERO review the national federation was in the process of considering changes to the governance and management structure of the organisation. This is likely to present an opportunity for further review and improvement to communication and support for centres.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Parents are increasing their understanding and use of self review as a way of making improvements to the quality of education and care for children. They recognise that a next step is to strengthen and deepen the quality of self review in order to build more sustainable improvement. This includes recording and documenting self review, reflecting on progress in annual planning and meetings, and evaluating how it has led to better outcomes for children and parents.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Opotiki Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Opotiki Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>5 June 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
