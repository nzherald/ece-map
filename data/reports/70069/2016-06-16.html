</table><p>Papanui Preschool requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre has made little progress in meeting the recommendations of the 2013 report.</p><p>In 2014 the head teacher and owner had support from the Ministry of Education (MOE) to assist the centre to develop its strategic planning and self-review processes. They have made some progress in strategic planning but have not been able to sustain an ongoing programme of self review.</p><p>A number of key management systems and teaching practices, to promote ongoing improvement for high quality learning and teaching have not been developed or are in the early stages of implementation.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Papanui Preschool is a small, privately-owned centre. It is situated in a converted house providing care and education for up to 42 children from under two years old to school age in two separate buildings. The roll is starting to increase and includes a number of children from a diverse range of cultures.</p><p>Teachers have early childhood qualifications and many staff have worked in the centre for a number of years.</p><p>Since the last review, there has been a change to the leadership of the centre with the appointment of a new manager in 2013. The progress the centre made in addressing the recommendations from the last review is more evident following MOE assistance in strategic planning and self review, however these areas still need further development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from positive and respectful relationships with their teachers and other children. A sense of belonging exists for infants, toddlers and young children which is actively fostered by caring and supportive teachers.</p><p>Children have easy access to a learning environment that encourages exploration and provides challenges. Good use is made of the outdoor space where children actively follow their own interests and engage in a range of physical activities.</p><p>Teachers set and regularly reflect on individual learning goals that focus on children's individual needs. However, children's interests are not always supported by a range of appropriate resources to support and extend their learning.</p><p>Parents and whānau are warmly welcomed into the centre. Teachers promote a sense of community amongst parents and whānau from all cultures.</p><p>Children are well supported as they transition into and within the centre. Teachers work closely with families to meet the specific needs of individual children. They are developing close links with local schools to help children’s transitions.</p><p>Teachers provide children who are under-two-years old with a nurturing, responsive environment. Children benefit from calm and unhurried interactions and routines. They are provided with an interesting range of learning activities and have easy access to a wide variety of resources. Children’s learning goals are clearly displayed for teachers and parents to focus on and review.</p><p>The centre’s strategic planning processes have started to help the licensee and the head teacher to clarify the centre’s priorities and to determine and record actions that will help them achieve their goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified, and the licensee and head teacher agree, that the following next steps are necessary to sustain and improve the centre's capacity and capability to provide high quality learning outcomes for all children. The leaders and teachers need to:</p><ul>
<li>increase bicultural practices in teaching, learning and centre documentation</li>
<li>improve the quality and usefulness of assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>fully implement and regularly use the staff appraisal system</li>
<li>provide opportunities for teachers to give anonymous feedback to the manager and licensee so that they can ascertain teachers wellbeing, and professional needs</li>
<li>develop and implement an ongoing process of self review</li>
<li>refine strategic planning by evaluating the progress and impact in order to clarify annual priorities.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum, personnel and health and safety. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>staff appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitoring of sleeping children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008: 43 (1a), 47 (1e), 46 (1a)</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Papanui Preschool will be within two years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>16 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
