</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edukids Kilmarnock operates under the BestStart Educare Ltd management structure. BestStart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large national organisation that owns early childhood centres across New Zealand.</p><p>The centre provides education and care for children up to school age and is licensed for 85 children, including 25 children aged up to two years old. An increasing number of the staff, children and families are from diverse cultures and backgrounds.</p><p>The centre is set up as four rooms; a nursery, toddler room, preschool and a prep-room for the oldest children. It is well resourced and well maintained.</p><p>A centre manager oversees the day-to-day operation of the centre. She is supported in her role by regular visits from a business manager and a professional service manager from the BestStart organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The teaching team has successfully developed a shared philosophy that guides how they work with children and their families. Teachers have given careful consideration to what the philosophy looks like in practice in each of the rooms.</p><p>A feature of this centre is the way managers and teachers focus on promoting effective relationships and supporting children and their families to feel included.</p><p>Teachers highly value the diverse cultural backgrounds of children by ensuring their individual needs, languages, and cultures are recognised and responded to in respectful ways. Some teachers speak often to children and parents in their first languages.</p><p>The needs of infants and toddlers are well met by highly responsive adults. Children have sensitive and caring interactions with teachers who know them well. Teachers show respect for children’s preferences and make sure children experience consistency between the routines in their homes and centre.</p><p>Children benefit from responsive interactions with their teachers that promote their learning. Teachers receive useful feedback about the quality of their teaching through an effective appraisal system. They attend regular professional learning and development to improve their teaching practices. Managers are building a reflective centre culture where teachers regularly discuss and think more deeply about their teaching, what is working well and ways they can improve.</p><p>The programme is strongly based on children’s interests, ideas and what they want to learn about. Teachers are making increasing use of parents' aspirations for their children’s learning, to inform their programme planning. Children have a rich range of curriculum experiences. Oral language development and capabilities are recognised and well supported. Children’s social, self help and literacy skills are effectively promoted.</p><p>Teachers make good use of the building spaces to extend children’s experiences and support families. This includes using a communal space to provide additional indoor physical play and provide a gathering space for groups of parents to meet. Teachers have identified that the outdoor area for the youngest children could be enhanced. They are currently planning for improvements to this area.</p><p>Teachers have effective partnerships with families. They regularly share useful information with parents about what children learn during their time at the centre.</p><p>Teachers' strengths are well used. Their leadership potential is recognised and fostered through regular coaching and mentoring.</p><p>The centre is well led and managed. The centre manager, professional service manager and the business manager work in partnership to successfully implement BestStart management systems and promote better outcomes for children and their families.</p><p>BestStart has many systems to help centres improve learning outcomes for children. These include:</p><ul>
<li>a review process to identify what is going well, and next steps for centre improvement</li>
<li>support for centre managers for the day-to-day operation of their centres from regular visits of education and business managers</li>
<li>effective systems and processes for ensuring that children have safe and healthy learning environments.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre managers and teachers have reliably identified, and ERO agrees, that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening self review, by following a clearer process and focusing more on evaluating the quality of teaching</li>
<li>further developing the ways teachers evaluate the programme and the effectiveness of their teaching strategies</li>
<li>giving greater prominence to Māori perspectives in documentation and practices</li>
<li>strengthening links with local schools so that children and their families experience well supported transitions as they move from the centre to school.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edukids Kilmarnock completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edukids Kilmarnock will be in four years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>16 November 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
