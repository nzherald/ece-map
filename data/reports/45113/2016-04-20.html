</table><p>Dorie Community Preschool is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Dorie Community Preschool is owned and operated by the community. The centre provides good quality education and care for infants, toddlers and children to school age. It is located next to the primary school.</p><p>Children attend the centre from a wide rural area. An increasing number of children are from a diverse range of cultures.</p><p>There has been a number of staff changes since the last ERO review. Most staff are qualified early childhood teachers. The centre is governed by a skilled, elected parent board.</p><p>The centre has made good progress in addressing most areas for further development identified in the 2013 ERO report. This includes increasing the visibility of bicultural practice in the learning programmes, strengthening self review and improving assessment and planning processes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and confidently make choices about their play. Teachers are strongly focused on fostering children's wellbeing and social skills.</p><p>Children have good access to a broad range of well-presented resources to support their play. Centre leaders and teachers have designed the outdoor area to promote a range of physical challenges for children. Teachers make good use of the centre vegetable garden, fruit trees and plantings to encourage children to make healthy choices about their eating.</p><p>Teachers support children to find their own solutions to challenges. They regularly assess children's learning and plan a learning programme to support their emerging interests. Children have many opportunities to develop their ideas and extend their thinking.</p><p>Children experience caring, positive relationships with each other and their teachers. Children under two years of age, experience peaceful, unhurried routines with familiar teachers. They have many opportunities to explore their well-resourced indoor and outdoor environments. Teachers readily share information with parents in a range of effective ways. They are sensitive to children's needs and interests. Teachers show a deep understanding of their teaching philosophy in their practice.</p><p>Teachers have positive relationships with local schools. They provide many opportunities for children to be well prepared for school as part of the learning programme.</p><p>Children with diverse needs, including English as a second language, are very well supported by teachers and the board. Centre leaders and teachers provide effective support to families and parents with English as another language as they become part of the centre.</p><p>Transitions into and within the centre are well planned to meet the individual needs of children and families.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers create strong partnerships with parents through regular communication. Parents are well informed about their children's learning and development. They have a range of opportunities to contribute to children's learning and the operation of the centre. The annual parent survey provides centre leaders with good information about parent satisfaction.</p><p>The centre manager provides clear direction and supports staff to improve their teaching practice. Self review is becoming well established and promotes positive changes to teaching and centre practices.</p><p>Governance and management roles and responsibilities are well defined. The board is currently updating its strategic and annual action plans. It is strongly committed to the success of the centre and provides appropriate support to the centre manager.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders, and ERO agree, that the next key steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>extending on bicultural practices to ensure Māori children have a greater sense of belonging, identity and language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing teacher led practices in the programme to increase opportunities for children to make more decisions in their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seeking external expertise to better support teachers' practice and communication with children and families with English as a second language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening self review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitoring implementation of the new strategic and annual plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring teachers' appraisal goals are robust and linked to the centre's strategic direction and personal professional development.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Dorie Community Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Dorie Community Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>20 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
