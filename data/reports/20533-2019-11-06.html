</table><p>Royal Oak Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Royal Oak Learning Centre is an established, privately-owned education and care service for children aged between three and five years. Children enrolled at the centre are from diverse ethnic groups, including Chinese, Indian and Southeast Asian. A small number of Māori children are also enrolled.</p><p>The owners operate a nearby centre for infants and toddlers. Daily management of both centres is the responsibility of a recently appointed centre manager. At this centre for older children, there is a head teacher, two other qualified teachers and an unqualified staff member.</p><p>ERO's 2016 report noted the centre's sustained commitment to a child-led learning philosophy. It recommended that new management systems be embedded and that developing shared expectations for teaching practices was a priority. Some progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at this centre are self-managing, confident learners who initiate their own experiences and activities. They access a wide range of natural resources, often gathered during excursions to a nearby park. There are very good opportunities for children to engage in creative, imaginative and sustained play.</p><p>Routines support children's sense of belonging at the centre well. Teachers have a strong commitment to the philosophy of children learning through play. They observe children's play without redirecting or intervening too closely. Teachers could strengthen their response to spontaneous situations where intentional adult input could add complexity to children's learning. Teachers could benefit from professional development to build their knowledge and understanding of <em>Te Whāriki 2017,</em> the revised early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Teachers know children well. They celebrate and respect children's diverse ethnic backgrounds. Aspects of te reo and tikanga Māori are included in the programme. Literacy, mathematics and science learning is incorporated into children's learning experiences. Teachers notice children's interests and strengths, and plan how to respond. They could strengthen this practice by planning for valued learning outcomes and dispositions, in addition to the provision of resources.</p><p>Teachers record and analyse children's individual and group learning well. They seek information from parents about their hopes for their child. Teachers could now record how they respond to information shared by parents. They could also more regularly record how children's learning has progressed over time.</p><p>The head teacher and teachers work collaboratively. There is a strong team culture. A cycle of review has been established. Teachers regularly discuss the improvements they make to the environment and resources. They could now focus on how they could change or improve their own teaching practices, individually and as a team. This should include evaluating the impact of teaching practices on children's learning.</p><p>Continuing to improve the process of teacher appraisal is a priority for the owners and manager. This process must be linked to Teaching Council standards and include observations of teaching practice. Specific long-term improvement goals for this centre now need to be developed and monitored. The involvement of teachers in evaluating progress towards these goals is important.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for improvement include managers and teachers:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increasing their knowledge and use of <em>Te Whāriki 2017</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating and recording the impact of teaching practices and curriculum experiences on children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing a staff appraisal process that meets Teaching Council requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating and documenting progress towards centre-specific long-term goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Royal Oak Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Since the onsite visit the service has provided ERO with evidence that shows it has taken steps to address the following non-compliance areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>A Fire Evacuation Scheme approved by the New Zealand Fire Service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medication records include evidence of parental acknowledgement that medication was administered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appointment policies and processes include safety checks that meet the requirements of the Children's Act 2014.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Services 2008;</em> <em><span>H</span></em><em>S4,</em><em><span>28, GMA7A.</span></em></p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>6 November 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
