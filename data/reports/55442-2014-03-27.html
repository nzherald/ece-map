<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><p>Terms of Reference</p><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Childcare and Nanny Services Ltd governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the November 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>quality assurance processes</li>
<li>self review</li>
<li>appraisal.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Childcare and Nanny Services Ltd (55442) is one of two home-based care networks owned and managed by the two directors of Childcare and Nanny Services (CNS). CNS provides support to families who have employed a nanny, or use the services of a home educator, to look after their children in their own or the educator&rsquo;s home. Programme managers, who are registered early childhood teachers, are employed to guide and support educators. The educators in this network have undertaken an early childhood course of training.</p><p>The November 2012 ERO report identified significant areas for development. Educators&rsquo; knowledge and implementation of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, needed to be increased. This included assessment, planning and evaluation and their bicultural curriculum. CNS management processes for documenting the monitoring of legislative and health and safety requirements needed to be strengthened and made more systematic and formal. The development of a shared understanding of self review, with regular consultation with parents and educators, was identified for development. ERO also identified the need to strengthen the appraisal process for programme managers and educators.</p><p>Directors and programme managers took part in post-review assistance with ERO and developed an action plan to address these areas for development. They have been proactive in sourcing external professional development to increase their knowledge and shared understanding relating to the terms of reference for this ERO review.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>Curriculum. Directors and programme managers have strengthened processes and resources for developing educators&rsquo; knowledge and implementation of the curriculum. They ensure that the orientation programme for new educators is comprehensive. This includes an introduction through the CNS educator professional development modules to expectations and requirements. Understanding of<em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em> and assessment, planning and evaluation are emphasised. The 'Working with Te Wh&#257;riki' module has been extensively rewritten and is now a useful, relevant learning module. It includes suggestions and questions to support educators to reflect on their practice.</p><p>Programme. managers share useful templates with educators to increase their knowledge of current theory in assessment, planning and evaluation. They provide workshops and resources for educators and support their practice through regular visits.</p><p>Directors and programme managers have participated in professional development as a team to increase their knowledge of the Treaty of Waitangi. They have reviewed the emphasis on te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori in their daily practice. Consequently, they have identified that making these practices more visible and used confidently is a priority. ERO&rsquo;s evaluation affirms this emphasis. This development is clearly linked to the programme managers&rsquo; appraisal process. Programme managers support educators to increase their knowledge of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori by modelling expected practice at playgroups and during home visits.</p><p>Quality assurance practices. The directors have strengthened quality assurance practices. Schedules for tracking and documenting hazard management have been improved and the process is now more robust and systematic. The formal orientation process for new educators and families to explain expectations has been refined.</p><p>Self review. Following work with an external professional development provider, a well-considered self-review process is in place. Self review is valued by the directors as a process to promote improvement. ERO recommends that future self review evaluates how well practices improve outcomes for children. Use of indicators of quality should enable more specific review. An in-depth review of the philosophy is planned for early this year. Links between the annual plan and self review are evident.</p><p>Appraisal. Directors have improved the appraisal system for programme managers. The strengthened process includes clear links to the Registered Teacher Criteria. There is a stronger focus on evidence-based discussion, feedback and goal setting. Consideration has been given to the use of <em>T&#257;taiako: Cultural Competences for Teachers of M&#257;ori Learners</em>. Programme managers and directors state that the new appraisal process is useful to promote ongoing development of their practice. Regular professional learning meetings support the appraisal process.</p><p>Areas of non-compliance from the 2012 ERO report relating to the formal oversight of identifying, recording and managing hazards and meeting curriculum requirements have been addressed.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>Directors and programme managers should consider and implement appropriate strategies to encourage and make it easier for parents to contribute to planning and assessment for their child, and to the organisation and strategic direction of CNS.</p><p>ERO&rsquo;s evaluation affirms the plan to review how educators are appraised. The current method should be replaced by a new, user-friendly process that includes regular feedback from programme managers and agreed next steps. This is likely to better support continuous improvement in educators' practice.&nbsp;</p><a id="3-next-ero-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next ERO Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h3><p>The next ERO review of Childcare and Nanny Services Ltd (55442) will be in three years.</p><p><img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" align="left">Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>27 March 2014&nbsp;</p><a id="information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">
