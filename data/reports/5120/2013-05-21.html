<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>George Street Kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. The focus teachers place on inquiry based learning supports children to work collaboratively and become independent learners.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>George Street Kindergarten is a well established service that provides education and care for children over two years old in Waiuku, South Auckland. The kindergarten has operated the kindergarten day model (KDM) for several years and offers children either three hour sessions or sessions that match school hours. In 2013 the centre has experienced a very high roll turnover due to the number of children transitioning from the kindergarten to school. Consequently, most children in the kindergarten are relatively young. The kindergarten is part of the Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association and operates within the policies and management framework of this organisation. A professional practice manager (PPM) visits and provides management and curriculum support for teachers.</p><p>Teachers have worked together in the kindergarten for four years and have established a collaborative team. As two of the teachers work part time, the team is aware of the need to communicate well and manage workloads effectively. Shared professional development helps teachers maintain a cohesive approach to teaching and learning.</p><p>In 2010 ERO acknowledged the strengths of the then new teaching team. The report recommended improvements in planning and the quality of learning experiences for children. Teachers have responded positively to these recommendations and continue to enhance their own skills and knowledge in order to provide well for children.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children are enthusiastic learners, engaged and confident in the kindergarten. Their relationships with teachers are positive and friendly, and they work cooperatively with their peers. Teachers are responsive to children&rsquo;s developmental interests, recognising that their youngest group is still learning self-help skills and becoming familiar with the resources. Older children engage in inquiry learning through ongoing topics that help them to theorise, problem solve, negotiate and work collaboratively. They develop tuakana/teina relationships with younger children and model strategies for independent learning. Children benefit from authentic opportunities to develop early literacy and numeracy skills and enjoy many experiences that support early learning in science and technology.</p><p>Teachers skilfully identify children&rsquo;s strengths and emerging interests. They plan the environment to prompt children&rsquo;s exploration and extend their interests. Teachers use open questions to stimulate children&rsquo;s curiosity and engage them in conversations that challenge their thinking. Brief mat times and flexible snack routines minimise interruptions to play and provide opportunities for teachers to share conversations with children and promote their oral language, leadership and self-help skills.</p><p>Teachers meet frequently to share the learning they have noticed and ways to explore programme topics. They record children&rsquo;s learning very well in assessment portfolios and topic folders. Teachers use learning stories effectively to analyse children&rsquo;s progress and thus provide families with very good information about children&rsquo;s strengths and interests. A recent development in programme planning that is helping teachers to identify strategies for further extending individual interests should become a sound basis for programme evaluation.</p><p>Families value the quality of learning their children experience. Some families have been using the kindergarten for two or three generations and believe the kindergarten continues to provide a rich environment and supportive teachers. Parents feel included in their children&rsquo;s learning through their daily conversations with teachers, children's portfolios and their involvement in programme events and excursions. They express a strong sense of belonging in the kindergarten.</p><p>The PPM for the kindergarten recognises the strengths of the teaching team. She focuses her support on empowering the head teacher and sourcing professional development opportunities for teachers to grow their own leadership skills and achieve self-identified goals. The PPM is confident that teachers&rsquo; reflective practices and commitment to self review will effectively sustain the quality of the programmes they provide.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teachers, the PPM and ERO agree that key next steps for kindergarten development should include:</p><ul>
<li>ongoing refinement of self-review processes to more succinctly document teachers&rsquo; findings and follow up actions</li>
<li>implementing programme evaluations where teachers reflect on the effectiveness of planned responses to children&rsquo;s emerging interests</li>
<li>formalising opportunities for older children to set long-term learning goals and assess their progress towards achieving them.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are also keen to continue developing their bicultural practices to further support the success of M&#257;ori children. They have sourced professional development opportunities to facilitate this learning. Teachers also intend to further develop their understanding of other cultures to strengthen the ways they support children identified by the government as priority learners, including Pacific Island children and those with diverse learning needs. The PPM is providing good support for these initiatives.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of George Street Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>21 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
