</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Kelvin Road provides full day education and care for children from the local Remuera community. The centre is licensed for 30 children including eight up to two years of age. The centre operates in a well-converted house set in a large outdoor space.</p><p>The centre is part of the BestStart organisation, which provides a strong management framework. It also provides a range of support services and personnel, including a professional services manager (PSM) and a business manager (BM) to support the smooth operation of the centre. The centre is led by a centre manager, a head teacher and a small team of teachers and caregivers. The head teacher is new to the centre. The centre manager plans to review the centre's philosophy statement to gain all teachers' input to this document that guides teaching and learning.</p><p>ERO's 2014 report commented on the many changes in centre leadership since its 2012 purchase by BestStart. Teachers were working well together, sustaining routines, making children and their families welcome and providing good care. The ERO report suggested a review of the philosophy to help teachers develop shared understandings of effective teaching and learning. It also suggested strengthening the planning cycle. These aspects of the centre are still under development</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews in the BestStart.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the centre. Teachers have established effective strategies for getting to know children and families. They share friendly and open conversations when children arrive and leave. Teachers have also initiated more formal conversations with parents during the year to discuss their children's progress and share ideas for future learning.</p><p>Children enjoy friendly and close connections with their peers. Tuakana/teina relationships, where older and younger children support and learn from each other, are evident in the playground. Small groups of children choose to play together for much of the day. They share lively conversations and pursue interests together.</p><p>The centre walls are used effectively to illustrate children's participation in ongoing explorations and interests. There is good evidence of exciting visits outside the centre and children's creative responses to these occasions.</p><p>The centre manager and teachers are making a concerted effort to build teamwork and to share professional knowledge. The recent appointment of the new head teacher should have a positive effect on strengthening professional practice and sharing leadership roles within the team.</p><p>Infants and toddlers enjoy times during the day when they are integrated with the older children. They also have time in their own secluded playroom that provides opportunities for them to explore, uninterrupted.</p><p>Teachers are also building their understanding and knowledge of te ao Māori and te reo me ōna tikanga Māori. While these initiatives are in the early stages, some teachers are beginning to use words and phrases in te reo Māori with the children.</p><p>Transitions into and through the centre are well managed. An internal evaluation focus on children's entry into the centre as young infants has led to changes to the ways in which teachers help children to settle. Children are carefully supported when they leave the infant/toddler room to join the older children. Sound relationships with the adjacent school have had the effect of reassuring parents, and supporting a smooth next step for children in their learning journey.</p><p>Teachers keep parents informed on a daily basis about happenings in the centre using an online portal. They also provide a story each month for each child, about their interests. While these stories are well described by the photographs accompanying the stories, there is often a lack of detail about children's learning progress, and limited links that might provide this information. The centre manager has identified the need for teachers to continue to strengthen both assessment and planning processes.</p><p>Work has started on upgrading the outdoor area, and will continue to be a priority for BestStart in the coming months. Teachers are considering ways of using the indoor spaces more effectively. An upgrade of equipment and resources would also benefit children.</p><p>Governance systems are effective in guiding centre operations. A sound policy base is implemented through procedures determined by centre staff. Good systems are in place to ensure that staff follow routines and health and safety checks. The Professional Services Manager (PSM) shares regular reports that identify strengths and any improvements needed.</p><p>The BestStart PSM team has focused on improving assessment, planning and evaluation of programmes. The team is also working with teachers to strengthen their understanding of inquiry-based learning for children.</p><p>BestStart continues to provide good support for centres through professional development opportunities, management documentation and a range of quality assurance processes. PSMs and BMs maintain positive relationships with centre personnel and have high expectations for centre performance. The challenge for PSMs is to use their current focus on teaching as inquiry and newly developed mentoring processes to help centre managers and teachers achieve the high quality practices that BestStart values. Recent work to establish goal-focused strategic plans in each centre should also help to facilitate meaningful improvements in teaching and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager has identified next steps for building a strong team. These include working with teachers to continue:</p><ul>
<li>improving assessment and planning processes to more clearly reflect and support children's progress over time</li>
<li>strengthening the integration of te reo me ōna tikanga Māori as part of teachers' conversations with children.</li>
</ul><p>Managers and teachers should also:</p><ul>
<li>begin the collaborative review and redevelopment of the centre's philosophy as a shared document of beliefs about teaching and learning and about intended outcomes for children</li>
<li>provide a programme that challenges children through the knowledge, skills and information that they bring to their learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO suggests that BestStart personnel continue to support teachers to provide high quality education to extend and elaborate children's learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Kelvin Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Kelvin Road will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>20 September 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
