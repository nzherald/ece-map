</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kakano Early Childhood Centre in Clendon, Manurewa, is a community-based centre providing care and education for up to 43 children, including 13 infants and toddlers. The children enrolled are from the surrounding area of Clendon and most have Māori or Pacific Island heritages.</p><p>The centre is governed by board members from the Taonga Trust. A chief executive officer manages this centre and two other early childhood services under the umbrella of the Taonga Trust. The centre’s philosophy is aligned to the principles of <em>Te Whariki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Parent partnerships with teachers help to promote children’s interests and learning.</p><p>Staff are lead by an experienced and skilled, newly appointed supervisor who oversees the daily operations and administration of the centre. She is supported by two head teachers who manage the daily curriculum programmes. Teachers are well qualified and experienced and they reflect the diverse cultures of the community.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers support children to be confident and competent learners. They provide a variety of resources and opportunities for children to explore. As a result children are quick to settle in the programme, participate willingly and make choices in their play. Children show a strong sense of belonging in the centre. They learn to confidently talk with each other and with adults.</p><p>Staff who work with infants and toddlers are sensitive and caring. They know these young children well and are responsive to their needs and preferences. A separate area for infants and toddlers allows them to explore the environment at their own pace.</p><p>A focus on everyone learning together is a key feature of teachers’ practice. Positive team work is evident. Teachers are respectful and responsive to children and whānau. They provide resources that make children’s learning experiences more meaningful. The supervisor could work with teachers to provide more resources that challenge older children’s thinking and extend their learning.</p><p>Teachers model bicultural practices by using te reo and tikanga Māori in children’s play, particularly during mat times. They also encourage tuakana/teina relationships. Children of Pacific heritages and other ethnicities experience a programme that celebrates their identity, culture and languages. Some teachers speak children’s home languages to support them in their play, and to build relationships with their families.</p><p>Teachers’ partnerships with parents are based on attitudes of acceptance, respect and a willingness to listen. They value parent perspectives and are responsive to parents’ aspirations for their children’s learning.</p><p>The appointment of the new supervisor has added strength to the teaching team. Her leadership is positively influencing the curriculum programme and teaching practices. She is supporting teachers to build their capacity through self review and a more collaborative approach to teaching and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>developing a strategic plan and goals that reflect the centre’s philosophy</li>
<li>reviewing and modifying policies, procedures and documentation so that they are specifically for this centre</li>
<li>aligning teachers’ appraisal processes to the Registered Teachers Criteria</li>
<li>refining planning, assessment and evaluation practices to better support children’s individual interests.</li>
</ul><h3><span>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</span></h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kakano Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kakano Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>2 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
