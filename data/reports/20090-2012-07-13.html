<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Kindercare Learning Centres - Three Kings is a well established service that caters for up to fifty children, including twenty infants and toddlers. The Kindercare group provides systems and personnel to support the management and operation of the centre. The organisation-wide philosophy and values provide a sound foundation for the programme.</p><p align="left">Key features of this centre that contribute to the high quality provision for babies, toddlers and children include respect for children as individuals and learners, extending children&rsquo;s learning, partnerships with families, and the professional approach of the highly effective teaching teams.</p><p align="left">The centre provides good quality care and education for children. Warm and trusting relationships between adults and children are a feature. Teachers nurture children&rsquo;s sense of belonging, supporting them to develop as independent and confident learners. High quality interactions and care routines foster children&rsquo;s social, emotional and language competencies.</p><p align="left">The centre environment promotes children&rsquo;s engagement in the programme. Play areas invite and provoke children&rsquo;s exploration. Children enjoy the natural environment, which extends their interest in gardens and insects. A very good variety of quality equipment and resources is accessible to stimulate children&rsquo;s curiosity and play. Teachers and families share information in order to plan for children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p align="left">Teachers are skilled and supportive facilitators of learning. Their programmes are responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and dispositions. Portfolios reflect children&rsquo;s learning stories and their progress and development. Centre leaders continue to strengthen parent and wh&#257;nau voice in the centre programme and children&rsquo;s portfolios.</p><p align="left">A capable and effective centre director and Kindercare personnel help to promote respectful, appreciative relationships and build the capacity and capability evident among staff. Individual strengths are acknowledged and positive team work supports the development of teaching and learning. Ongoing self review reflects the centre&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that all centre operations continue to improve.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kindercare Learning Centres - Three Kings was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKindercare Learning Centres - Three Kings.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Kindercare Learning Centres-Three Kings operates in accordance with Kindercare philosophy, policies and management, including programme planning and professional development processes.</p><p align="left">A new centre director has recently been appointed in 2012. Her practices are reflective of a focus on the continuing importance of relationships with children, teachers, and parents/wh&#257;nau. She is leading a vision for ongoing centre improvement.</p><p align="left">Recommendations made in the 2009 ERO report have been implemented well.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4 align="left">Strongly positive relationships</h4><p align="left">Warm and trusting relationships between adults and children are a strong feature of the centre. Very good team work supports the development of a positive centre culture. Teachers model and foster respectful interactions. They engage with children and work alongside them in their play. Teaching practices are adapted in response to the children&rsquo;s different levels of maturity. These very good practices help children to feel secure and confident in the centre.</p><h4 align="left">Learning environment</h4><p align="left">The centre&rsquo;s environment provokes and invites children&rsquo;s exploration for learning. Children enjoy the natural environment which extends their interest in gardens and insects. A variety of high quality equipment and resources is accessible to stimulate children&rsquo;s interest and curiosity. Children benefit from teachers&rsquo; focus on acknowledging and celebrating the heritage of Aotearoa, New Zealand. This is evident in the centre&rsquo;s bi-cultural curriculum that is reflected throughout the environment and in teachers&rsquo; practice.</p><h4 align="left">Extending children&rsquo;s&nbsp;learning</h4><p align="left">Teachers have a high level of awareness of the importance of engaging children in learning. Their use of open-ended questions extends children&rsquo;s vocabulary and allows them to express their feeling and emotions. Teachers support children to take increasing responsibility for self care and make decisions about their play and choice of resources. The high quality interactions and care routines foster children&rsquo;s social, emotional and language competencies.</p><h4 align="left">Parent partnerships</h4><p align="left">Teachers use workshops, concerts and children&rsquo;s portfolios to build strong connections with parents and wh&#257;nau and to include them in centre life. Teachers and families share information that contributes to children&rsquo;s learning in centre programmes. These partnership practices have enhanced children&rsquo;s deeper level learning.</p><h4 align="left">Transition to school</h4><p align="left">Teachers incorporate the use of Foundation Skills for Learning and a You can do it programme to build children&rsquo;s independent and self managing skills as they prepare for school. These programmes are integrated effectively into the context of children&rsquo;s play. The centre director wants to continue to strengthen the relationships with local schools to improve the transition process for children.</p><h4 align="left">Self review</h4><p align="left">There is a culture of teacher reflection and centre self review. The annual management plan is used as a guide for documenting the various areas of self review, which involves consultation with teachers, and parents/wh&#257;nau. As a result there is ongoing improvement to the care and education of children and centre practices.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Kindercare Learning Centres - Three Kings completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>

The Kindercare group provides systems and personnel to support the management and operation of the centre. The organisation-wide philosophy and values provide a sound foundation for the programme.</p><p align="left">Key features of this centre that contribute to the high quality provision for babies, toddlers and children include respect for children as individuals and learners, extending children&rsquo;s learning, partnerships with families, and the professional approach of the highly effective teaching teams.</p><p align="left">The centre provides good quality care and education for children. Warm and trusting relationships between adults and children are a feature. Teachers nurture children&rsquo;s sense of belonging, supporting them to develop as independent and confident learners. High quality interactions and care routines foster children&rsquo;s social, emotional and language competencies.</p><p align="left">The centre environment promotes children&rsquo;s engagement in the programme. Play areas invite and provoke children&rsquo;s exploration. Children enjoy the natural environment, which extends their interest in gardens and insects. A very good variety of quality equipment and resources is accessible to stimulate children&rsquo;s curiosity and play. Teachers and families share information in order to plan for children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p align="left">Teachers are skilled and supportive facilitators of learning. Their programmes are responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and dispositions. Portfolios reflect children&rsquo;s learning stories and their progress and development. Centre leaders continue to strengthen parent and wh&#257;nau voice in the centre programme and children&rsquo;s portfolios.</p><p align="left">A capable and effective centre director and Kindercare personnel help to promote respectful, appreciative relationships and build the capacity and capability evident among staff. Individual strengths are acknowledged and positive team work supports the development of teaching and learning.
