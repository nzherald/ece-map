</table><p>Mayfield Kindergarten (Blenheim) is <em>Well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mayfield Kindergarten is one of seven kindergartens administered by Marlborough Kindergarten Association. A general manager oversees the association under the governance of an active, supportive and future-focused board.</p><p>The general manager is responsible for the operation of the kindergartens. A senior teacher provides advice and guidance for teachers on the curriculum, teaching practices and the running of the kindergarten. The head teacher manages the day-to-day operation of the kindergarten. All teachers are qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>The kindergarten serves a supportive and established community. It is located in a new modern classroom and office area with, a large and well-maintained outdoor learning area. Parents make a valuable contribution in many ways to the Kindergarten. Teachers have developed positive and respectful relationships with parents and whānau. Sustainable practices are a strong feature of the kindergarten.</p><p>The association and teachers have responded positively to the recommendations in the September 2011 ERO report. This includes strengthening the programme and acknowledging Māori children’s culture and heritage.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Marlborough Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The well-considered centre philosophy provides detailed guidance for teachers in their interactions with children and whānau.</p><p>Children play cooperatively and imaginatively together for sustained periods. Tuakana teina (children looking after and learning from each other) is clearly evident. Teachers try to ensure a balance of child initiated and intentional teaching experiences so children can learn in a natural and meaningful way. Children have easy access to a wide range of resources to challenge their learning and physical skills. Their independence and ability to work with and alongside other children is effectively encouraged.</p><p>Children’s assessments show a variety of learning opportunities and an emphasis on the natural world. Teachers personalise group stories. Many stories link to previous learning, integrate te reo Māori well and acknowledge children’s home cultures.</p><p>Regular visits into the local community enhance the learning programme and help children to make meaningful connections to the local environment.</p><p>Teachers are very caring and responsive to children’s individual interests, strengths and capabilities. They are highly supportive of parents and work closely together to foster children’s learning and wellbeing. Teachers communicate regularly with families and receive regular assistance and input in many ways from parents.</p><p>Children and families with specific needs are very well supported by the Association's specialist teacher and other appropriate agencies.</p><p>Close links with local schools benefits children and their parents. Teachers have developed a well-planned and purposeful transition into school. Parents are provided with useful assistance to help with transition.</p><p>The recently established teaching team are developing reflective practices that focus on improving learning outcomes for children. Teachers work collaboratively and are well supported by the newly appointed head teacher.</p><p>The Marlborough Kindergarten Association provides high levels of direction and support for managers and teachers. Managers ensure that teachers have access to a wide range of professional learning and development opportunities.</p><p>A recent review of biculturalism across the Association has identified that teachers have an understanding of bicultural practices and are in the early stages of increasing teachers’ use of te reo and tikanga Māori. Te ao Māori is given prominence. They have used their recent professional development to include a greater focus of local Māori culture within the programme.</p><p>Since the September 2011 ERO report, the managers have undertaken a thorough review of self review practices. They have identified that this is an ongoing area to continue to develop. Teachers’ understanding of self review is increasing. The useful and recently introduced self review format is helping them focus on how they can improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The Association’s long term plan gives clear direction and identifies specific priorities that are focused on improvement. Mayfield Kindergarten’s annual plan closely links with the Association’s long term plan. However, parts of this plan could be more specific and include detailed short and long term goals.</p><p>The Marlborough Kindergarten Association has a comprehensive policy and procedure framework in place to provide clear expectations for kindergarten operations and the monitoring of health and safety.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager and senior teacher have identified and ERO agree that assessment of children’s learning needs to be strengthened. Teachers now need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clearly identify the learning that is happening for individual children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase the ways they include parent and child views about learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistently identify the role of the teacher and what they will do to support children’s future learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers also need to more clearly document and show how children’s emerging interests are being met.</p><p>The Association is currently reviewing the existing appraisal process. Managers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the appraisal process needs to be further extended. This should include more robust and formal feedback for teachers.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mayfield Kindergarten (Blenheim) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‘have’ or ‘have not’ taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mayfield Kindergarten (Blenheim) will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>19 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
