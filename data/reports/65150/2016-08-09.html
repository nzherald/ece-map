</table><p>Little People Preschool Richmond Requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The centre has few effective management systems and practices to ensure the legal requirements are met and children are provided with a safe environment and good quality education for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little People Preschool Richmond is one of two centres owned and operated under the same management structure. This centre provides care and education for babies to school aged children. Babies and children share the same indoor and outdoor environments. A separate sleep room is provided for children under-two-years old. Nearly all staff are qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, the manager and teachers have developed a new philosophy, introduced a more child-led curriculum, and built a new sandpit and an outdoor play house. However, little progress has been made in meeting many of the recommendations in the 2013 ERO report. These recommendations related to internal evaluation, strategic planning, staff appraisal, child assessment and programme planning.  </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The recently completed philosophy statement clearly outlines the centre's priorities for children's learning and wellbeing. It provides useful indicators for reviewing the quality of care and education the centre provides for all children. </p><p>Children have positive relationships with each other and their teachers. They are encouraged to respect and include others in their play. Older children readily include younger children and support them in their learning and social development.</p><p>Teachers make good use of the relationships that they build with children to extend their learning and understanding of the world. They praise, listen carefully and use thoughtful questioning to help children think more deeply and solve problems.</p><p>Children and teachers actively seek ways to include children with additional needs in a wide range of activities. They value the contribution these children make to the centre's culture and programme.</p><p>The programme provides many opportunities for children to follow their interests and choose their learning pathways. Creativity is promoted through the use of natural or recycled resources. Children have a good range of experiences within the centre and in the wider community.</p><p>Te reo and tikanga Māori are becoming better integrated into the programme with support from teachers who have a knowledge of this area of the curriculum. The managers and teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next step is to involve Māori parents more in sharing their aspirations for their children to succeed as Māori.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively. They have recently been given leadership roles within the centre and invited to share their interests to extend the programme and children's learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager urgently needs to establish an effective management framework that will build capacity, improve and sustain good quality learning and teaching for all children. To achieve this objective the next steps should include:</p><ul>
<li>establishing clear roles and responsibilities for managers, leaders and staff</li>
<li>ensuring policies and procedures meet legislative requirements, cover all areas of centre operations and are regularly reviewed</li>
<li>establishing internal evaluation practices that result in regular, indepth and completed evaluations</li>
<li>developing strategic planning that is useful, gives clear direction and is regularly monitored</li>
<li>embedding the new staff appraisal process and establishing appraisal for the manager</li>
<li>improving the usefulness of child assessment, individual and group planning to guide learning and teaching</li>
<li>establishing systems and practices to ensure health and safety requirements are met at all times.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little People Preschool Richmond completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to management and health and safety. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>effective governance and management practices including self review and personnel</li>
<li>document systems and procedures to promote the safety of children enrolled.</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, 47(GMA4. GMA6, GMA7); 46(HS8, HS31)</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little People Preschool Richmond will be within two years. </p><p>Lesley Patterson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>9 August 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
