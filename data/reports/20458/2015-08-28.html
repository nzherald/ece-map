</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Jolly Stars Early Learning Centre caters for children from two years to school age. The centre is licensed for twenty five children and offers full day education and care. It operates from a modified house and this promotes a home-like, family friendly environment.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy aligns well with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. A commitment to increasing children's access to quality education, and caring for families underpins the centre’s values and educational philosophy.</p><p>The centre caters for a culturally diverse local community. Many children speak more than one language. Teachers value and affirm children’s identity and rich cultural heritage. They prioritise developing open, friendly and reciprocal relationships with whānau.</p><p>Since the 2013 supplementary ERO review, there have been significant positive changes. New teaching staff, who have early childhood educational expertise, have joined the team. The roll has continued to increase.</p><p>The owner and new teachers have made very good use of Ministry of Education (MOE) professional development and support. Their involvement in broad educational networks now effectively supports ongoing improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families benefit from the many well thought through changes in the centre. The centre owner works respectfully and collaboratively with teachers. This is helping to develop the new, cohesive teaching team.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate a high level of engagement in external and internal self review to promote ongoing improvement. They have improved the quality of teaching and children's learning by implementing useful professional development.</p><p>Children's learning and wellbeing is well promoted. Positive and respectful interactions between teachers and children help create a settled and calm environment. Children receive good support from teachers to develop their social and emotional competence. They collaborate effectively during play and show kindness to each other.</p><p>Children have good access to a range of resources. Ongoing improvements to the indoor and outdoor learning environments are evident. Teachers are currently reviewing the variety and use of resources to extend children's learning interests and further promote their curiosity and exploration.</p><p>Māori children are well supported to develop their confidence and capability as successful learners. Teachers have thoroughly reviewed their bicultural practices and have engaged in useful professional development to increase their knowledge of tikanga and te reo Māori. Whānau appreciate the meaningful ways teachers integrate tikanga and te reo through the programme.</p><p>Pacific children’s individual heritage and languages are acknowledged. They benefit from teachers who have developed collaborative partnerships with their families. Celebrations of Pacific languages and cultures offer good opportunities for families to contribute to the programme.</p><p>Children from other ethnic backgrounds also benefit from a responsive and inclusive curriculum. Teachers continue to expand their knowledge and use of all children's home languages to further support children’s bilingual confidence and communication skills.</p><p>The programme is now child-led and flexible. New planning, assessment and evaluation systems are in place and are becoming well established. Teachers carefully notice and effectively respond to children’s strengths and interests. Teachers respect children’s decisions and contributions to the programme.</p><p>Whānau are well informed about their children’s learning. Children's portfolios are useful and attractive records of each child’s engagement in learning. Teachers have identified they would like to work with whānau to help review and better document children’s progress over time.</p><p>Children benefit from the collaborative and ongoing partnerships between the centre and their home. Whānau expectations and aspirations are respected and influence teachers’ planning. Children and their families receive very good support from teachers to help children transition to the centre and to school.</p><p>The centre is well led and effectively managed. There is a sound policy and procedure framework in place together with a regular cycle of review. Performance management is robust and well aligned to strategic goals. Ongoing and useful professional development is improving children's learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre owner agree to continue to improve outcomes for children, it would be useful to:</p><ul>
<li>develop a shared understanding of effective bilingual and bicultural teaching practices</li>
<li>further align performance management goals to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>use indicators to guide and evaluate the centre’s progress towards achieving strategic goals</li>
<li>promote more complex and challenging literacy and mathematical learning opportunities within the context of play.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Jolly Stars Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Jolly Stars Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>28 August 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
