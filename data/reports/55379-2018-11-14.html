</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Just Us Kids is a privately owned early learning service centrally located in Carterton. It is licensed for a maximum of 34 children up to five years of age, including 10 up to the age of two.</p><p>The centre manager is also a teacher who manages centre operation and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the centre. Since the October 2015 ERO report, a new head teacher has been appointed.</p><p>Of the present teachers employed, five are qualified, and one is in training.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service philosophy intentions are evident in the warm, welcoming environment. Teachers know children and their families well and friendships are promoted within a home-like atmosphere contributing to children's sense of belonging. Children confidently and competently engage in the programme. Flexible learning spaces are responsive to the needs of all children.</p><p>Children are able to lead their own learning. Teachers provide range of learning experiences and resources and work alongside children to support their independence, exploration, imagination and social competencies.</p><p>Teachers make the most of opportunities to extend children’s learning and foster language development. Literacy, mathematics and science are well integrated into learning experiences. Regular excursions into the community and engagement in community events provide further learning opportunities.</p><p>The recent implementation of an online assessment tool contributes to greater parent input and sharing of children's interests between home and the centre. Profile book information shows children's participation and engagement in the programme and emerging interests.</p><p>It is timely to review the centre's curriculum policy and procedures in line with current theory and practice, to promote a shared understanding and expectations of what effective assessment, planning and evaluation practices look like. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>children's voice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>intentional teaching for individuals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>connections to children's culture, language and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>responsiveness to parent aspirations and perspectives.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers engage with families and external agencies to support children who require additional learning support. Learning spaces are carefully designed to minimise potential barriers to learning.</p><p>Te ao Māori is reflected through the authentic use of te reo Māori, resources and relationships with whānau. Strengthening te ao in the environment is the focus of an ongoing review. Teachers express a commitment to building their cultural competencies.</p><p>The teaching team is committed to the development of the bicultural programme. Staff are beginning to consider how the curriculum can reflect a Māori world view.</p><p>Positive relationships between the centre staff and local schools supports older children’s transition. Parents are encouraged to be a part of the process.</p><p>Regular reviews inform decision making. A next step is shifting the focus from what they are doing, to evaluating how well teaching and learning practices strengthen outcomes for children. Developing a shared understanding of internal evaluation is an agreed next step.</p><p>Leadership is focused on building teacher capability and collaborative ways of working. There is a clear commitment to developing staff knowledge and skills through ongoing professional learning and the sharing of good practice.</p><p>Some aspects of governance and management require strengthening. There is a useful framework for strategic planning. This should be further developed to clearly identify the service's priorities and actions to progress these. Leaders are aware of the need to establish a more systematic cycle of policy review to ensure the service is responsive to meeting its legislative obligations. This includes reviewing the current appraisal process to ensure it aligns to the Education Council guidelines.</p><p>The centre owners with support of the recently appointed head teacher are responsible for the centre operation, curriculum and teaching practices. Clearly identifying the roles and responsibilities of each member of the leadership team, should support them to progress the changes and improvements required.</p><p>It is timely for teachers to review the philosophy in relation to the intended outcomes for children. This would support them to evaluate its effectiveness in promoting these outcomes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre leaders agree that the priorities for Just Us Kids are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further develop assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the policies and procedures to ensure these are current and reflect best practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a shared understanding and use of internal evaluation</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Just Us Kids completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Just Us Kids will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>14 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
