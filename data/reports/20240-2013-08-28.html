<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p>Best of Both Worlds Childcare Limited is a small home-based network, operating within Auckland City and Rodney districts. This organisation caters for children from infants to school-age and provides education and care by qualified teachers within their own homes. The network is coordinated by the owner, who is a qualified early childhood teacher.</p>
<p>The service has effective operations and systems that result in positive outcomes for children and their families.</p>
<p>High quality personalised care for children is a key strength of the network. Children&rsquo;s individual care needs are met within the unhurried natural rhythms of the home. Relationships between network teachers and families are authentic and respectful. Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and confidence, and parents speak with appreciation about the service provided. There are good systems and useful procedures in place to promote and protect the health and safety of children.</p>
<p>There is a focus on providing a learning programme that is responsive to the individual child&rsquo;s identified interests and strengths. Children enjoy a good range of activities and learning experiences. Regular excursions into local communities are a prominent feature of the programme for many children. Education programmes reflect New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage by incorporating M&#257;ori language and resources that value traditional M&#257;ori culture. A record of children&rsquo;s learning is shared regularly with parents.</p>
<p>A high degree of professionalism underpins service operations. Network teachers are valued for the skills they bring to the service. There is an expectation of appropriate ongoing professional learning and development for all teachers, and this is positively impacting on the quality of education and care delivered by network teachers.</p>
<p>The key next step for the service is to establish systems for regular and systematic self review. By establishing and implementing good quality self review the network can be confident that it will continue to provide good outcomes for children and their families.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p>
<a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. The Focus of the Review</h2>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Children are cared for in the homes of self-employed network teachers under the umbrella of Best of Both Worlds Childcare Limited. All network teachers are qualified primary and/or early childhood teachers and hold current full teacher registration status. Network teachers are supported in providing educational programmes and care for children by the owner, who is also the network coordinator. This is the first ERO review of the service.</p>
<h4>Areas of good performance</h4>
<p><em>Personalised care</em>. Network teachers provide high quality care and view children&rsquo;s wellbeing as a necessary prerequisite for successful learning. Flexible, well-established routines based on individual children&rsquo;s emotional and physical needs are apparent. The small group setting allows individual attention to children as needed within the natural and unhurried rhythms of the home. Effective systems are in place to guide good health and safety practices.</p>
<p><em>Authentic teacher and parent relationships</em>. Open and respectful communication between the network teachers and parents is a positive feature of the network. Strong and responsive relationships are formed with each family, supporting children&rsquo;s sense of belonging. Network teachers recognise the diverse and unique perspectives of individual parents and wh&#257;nau, and value the contribution they bring to the service.</p>
<p><em>Effective provision for learning</em>. Network teachers recognise and value the importance of children learning through play. Children enjoy a learning programme that effectively responds to their strengths and interests in authentic and meaningful ways. The network has invested in a good range of equipment and resources, and the home environments are effectively adapted and resourced to support learning. Many children benefit from regular education experiences involving the local environment, people and amenities.</p>
<p><em>Commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi principles</em>. The network owner and teachers are committed to implementing a bicultural curriculum that acknowledges the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand and honours Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The values of whanaungatanga, manaakitanga, and aroha are evident in all aspects of service operations. Network teachers work to include M&#257;ori language and resources that value traditional M&#257;ori culture into the programme.</p>
<p><em>High degree of professionalism underpinning operations</em>. The network has a strong professional culture. The owner allows high levels of professional trust and independence for the network teachers. They are encouraged and supported to grow their interests and strengths, and are valued for the professional skills they bring to the service. Appropriate professional learning and development is provided through the network. Teachers also show a commitment to taking responsibility for growing their own skills and knowledge to continue to provide good outcomes for children.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p>ERO and the network owner agree that the key areas for development for the service are to:</p>
<ul><li>establish useful self-review processes to evaluate the effectiveness of the network and the service it provides</li>
<li>develop shared understandings of planning for, and assessing children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>strengthen appraisal systems to support teachers to maintain their teacher registration status.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management and staff of Best Of Both Worlds Childcare Limited completed an ERO <em>Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement</em> and <em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2>
<p>ERO and the service provider agree that the management should develop useful self-review systems to sustain a focus on continuous improvements.</p>
<a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p>
