</table><p>Ottawa Gardens Preschool and Nursery is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children. Some recent new management initiatives and documentation is at the early stage of being implemented to support and better reflect the good practices that are evident.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ottawa Gardens Preschool and Nursery is a small family-owned and operated service. As a result of the impact of the 2011 Canterbury Earthquakes it was rebuilt, on the existing site, in 2015 and fully re-licensed in July 2016. This new purpose-built centre offers care and education for children from birth to school age.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, there has been a significant change to staffing including the leadership of the centre. The manager and staff are at the early stages of addressing the recommendations from the March 2013 ERO report. The owner and manager have acquired the support of an external advisor to help them develop and implement some key management systems and practices.</p><p>The service philosophy has recently been reviewed to reflect what teachers, parents and whānau value in terms of children’s learning and wellbeing. This includes giving emphasis to te ao Māori.</p><p>The service is establishing good links with the local community. This includes being part of the Aranui learning cluster of schools that is focused on supporting the children and families in the local area.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The owner, manager and teachers foster positive and reciprocal relationships with children, parents and whānau. The learning environment is calm and inclusive. Families are warmly welcomed and helped to settle into the centre to build a positive sense of belonging.</p><p>The specific needs and wellbeing of infants, toddlers and young children are well met in the mixed age group setting where younger and older children learn and play with one another. Children are well supported to develop independence, social skills and friendships with others.</p><p>Teachers provide a curriculum that is responsive to children’s interests. The environment offers purposeful learning areas. Children have easy access to a wide variety of activities and learning experiences, including physical activity, music and art. Visitors to the centre enhance the learning programme offered to children.</p><p>Teachers integrate some te reo and tikanga Māori into the learning programme to help children begin to understand the bicultural nature of Aotearoa New Zealand. The spacious outdoor area offers many opportunities for children to explore and learn about the natural environment, including the care of the garden and animals.</p><p>Parents are well informed about centre events and their children’s participation through regular newsletters, digital technologies, and attractively presented individual profile books.</p><p>The centre owner, manager and teachers work well together and reflect a positive team culture. They are committed to ongoing improvement and promoting positive outcomes for children and families. The owner and manager have a collaborative approach to the leadership of the centre. They value and make good use of teacher’s skills and provide ongoing professional development to support and strengthen reflective practices, knowledge and capabilities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and service leaders agree that the key next steps are to further develop management systems and curriculum practices.</p><p>Management and leadership improvement should include a focus on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>embedding new appraisal processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to refine, implement and evaluate strategic planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing internal evaluation practices and processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extending professional relationships with the wider education community, including other early learning services and local school leaders.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Assessment, planning and curriculum evaluation improvement should include a focus on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>making better use of children's assessment to inform planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly identifying intended learning outcomes for children and teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing stronger partnerships with parents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>giving prominence to children's language, culture and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating how teaching practices improve children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Centre leaders should also continue to develop and integrate bicultural perspectives into centre and curriculum documentation and practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ottawa Gardens Preschool and Nursery completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the on-site stage of the review, ERO identified that some key policies and procedures needed to be further developed.</p><p>The owner and manager should ensure that the:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>requirements of the 'Vulnerable Child Act' are evident in appointment and police vetting policies and procedures.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ottawa Gardens Preschool and Nursery will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Te Waipounamu/Southern</p><p>22 December 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
