</table><p>Rotary Park Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rotary Park Kindergarten provides full day early childhood education for children aged two years to school age. It is licensed for 41 children and currently has a roll of 35.</p><p>The philosophy states that teachers aim to support children's developing capabilities for building positive relationships <span lang="mi">(ngā hononga)</span>; communication <span lang="mi">(mana reo)</span>, creativity <span lang="mi">(waihangatanga)</span>, and sustainable practice <span lang="mi">(kaitiakitanga)</span>. They plan to achieve these outcomes through building respectful, reciprocal relationships with children and families, fostering children's learning through play, purposeful resourcing and use of the environment and enacting the early childhood curriculum, <em><span lang="mi">Te Whāriki</span></em>.</p><p>Rotary Park Kindergarten is one of 24 kindergartens governed by Dunedin Kindergartens (DK). Day to day operations are led by a head teacher with the support of three experienced, qualified teachers. A senior teacher from DK provides support for professional and operational practice.</p><p>Since the November 2015 ERO review, there is a new head teacher. Some progress has been made in addressing areas for improvement identified in 2015. These included strengthening strategic planning and clarifying the kindergarten's philosophy and valued outcomes for children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven DK kindergartens reviewed at the beginning of 2020.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten's curriculum effectively supports children's learning. Children have daily and weekly opportunities to learn about, and care for the environment. They have regular excursions to a local forest. They lead and manage kindergarten sustainability practices. Older children are actively supported to take increasing responsibility for their self-care, kindergarten routines and support for younger children.</p><p>Children and their families experience responsive and respectful interactions with teachers. These foster their sense of belonging and wellbeing. Teachers follow children's interests and encourage their decision-making in play and learning. They intentionally model and extend children's language-learning, literacy, numeracy, active movement, exploration and creativity.</p><p>New Zealand's bicultural heritage is evident in the environment, programmes and routines. Teachers seek to respectfully celebrate and acknowledge the culture, language and identity of all children, including Māori children and whānau.</p><p>Teachers have reviewed and clarified the kindergarten's guiding philosophy and identified clear learning priorities for children. These are beginning to be embedded in planning and assessment for groups and individuals. Planning and assessment documentation show teachers are effectively responding to children's interests and parent and whānau aspirations. Stronger use of the kindergarten's new learning priorities and the goals and outcomes in <em><span lang="mi">Te Whāriki</span></em> will support ongoing improvement in assessment and planning for individuals. Teachers value and encourage active parent involvement and contribution to learning programmes.</p><p>The teaching team is reflective and well-focused on improving outcomes for children. Appraisal processes have been strengthened and are supporting teachers to individually and collaboratively investigate and develop their teaching practice. Spontaneous and ongoing evaluations of planning for groups and daily practices and routines result in changes that benefit children. Aspects of planned strategic evaluation need strengthening, particularly the use of clear indicators of effective practice. The new head teacher is continuing to build capability with support from DK. This has included a focus on identifying and collaboratively developing the longer-term strategic priorities for the kindergarten.</p><p>The DK board has made good progress in addressing the governance recommendations from ERO's 2015-2016 reviews. DK's mission and strategic priorities are well known and reflected in each kindergarten's strategic and annual plans. DK has a sound policy and procedure framework that provides guidance for kindergartens and sound systems to monitor health and safety. Leaders and teachers benefit from relevant professional development and leadership support. DK actively supports equity of outcomes for all children by funding additional teaching resources to support children with additional needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, leaders and teachers identified the following next steps for ongoing improvement:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen strategic planning for the kindergarten through the alignment of strategic priorities with internal evaluation, professional development and appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen planned internal evaluation through the identification and use of clear indicators of effective practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embed new curriculum priorities in assessment and planning processes and use these as indicators to evaluate outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review and improve assessment and planning practices for individuals with a stronger focus on the kindergarten's new curriculum priorities and the goals and outcomes from <em><span lang="mi">Te Whāriki</span></em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure ongoing monitoring and review of how well resourcing and the curriculum are providing for the needs of younger and older children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The DK board has clearly identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps to further improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure that reporting and monitoring at all levels are evaluative, to clearly show how desired outcomes for children have been improved in relation to the DK’s and kindergartens’ priorities for learning and other strategic priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that a robust and systematic quality assurance framework is implemented to inform and monitor ongoing improvements in each kindergarten.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rotary Park Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Southern)</p><p>Southern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Tini</span></p><p>22 May 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
