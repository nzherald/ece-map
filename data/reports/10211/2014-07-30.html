</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres (16) Hilltop, located in Orewa, north of Auckland, offers sessional and full day education and care options for families. The community is increasingly culturally diverse. Children are grouped according to age into four different areas: infants, toddlers, preschool 1 and preschool 2. The well established centre operates from purpose-built premises and is licensed for 90 children aged from three months to five years.</p><p>The centre’s effective leadership team includes a centre manager and supervisor, supported by a Kindercare area manager. They lead a team of well qualified staff. Together they provide a high level of education and care, as identified in previous ERO reports. Continued good practices include a welcoming environment, teaching that is responsive to children and their learning needs, effective teamwork, and positive partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>The centre is part of the Kindercare Learning Centre group which provides a framework for governance and management. Kindercare also provides professional advice and support to centre leaders and teachers. Kindercare’s philosophy statement promotes an environment where children are “safe, loved and learning” and this underpins teachers’ work with children and their families.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children of all ages experience caring and affectionate relationships with teachers. They are very well supported to engage in the programme, to become confident in their interactions with adults, and to socialise well with their peers. Teachers regularly add interest to the environment by presenting experiences that prompt children’s participation and thinking abilities.</p><p>Teachers communicate well as a team and use positive language with children to promote independence and decision making. Some use highly effective questioning to encourage children’s complex thinking and they skilfully promote children’s learning.</p><p>Programme planning is responsive to children’s interests. Teachers in the preschool rooms present attractive portfolios that show children’s learning over time and identify future learning opportunities. The centre supervisor, who is responsible for curriculum development, delivers high quality feedback to individual teachers to build capacity in this area. Teachers in the infant and toddler areas continue to develop children’s journals to make children’s learning apparent and clear.</p><p>Experienced centre leaders have high expectations of themselves and others. They know their teaching teams well and identify strengths, leadership potential, and next steps to grow teacher capacity. Appraisal processes effectively build practice. Teachers have made very good use of relevant professional learning and development to strengthen their knowledge about best practice in early childhood education.</p><p>There is a collaborative and honest approach to recognising and targeting areas for future centre development to foster high quality professional practice. Teachers’ receive very positive parent feedback about their provision for children’s learning and care. Centre leaders identify the need for a continued focus on deepening self-review processes to consolidate best practice understandings.</p><p>Kindercare personnel and internal systems support the highly effective practices at the centre. The area manager displays confidence in centre leaders and in their capability to lift the quality of the programme further. External resources are being well used to enhance the quality of care for children up to two years of age.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that self review could now be further used to enhance:</p><ul>
<li>bicultural practices that reflect the dual heritage of Aotearoa, New Zealand</li>
<li>opportunities for children of all ages to take increasing responsibility for independent self management and learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres (16) Hilltop completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres (16) Hilltop will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>30 July 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
