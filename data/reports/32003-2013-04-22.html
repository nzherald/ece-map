<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Kaiaua/Miranda Playcentre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Kaiaua/Miranda Playcentre is a parent cooperative operating under the umbrella of Thames Valley Coromandel Playcentre Association (the association). It is situated on an attractive rural site adjacent to Mangatangi School. The playcentre has a reciprocal relationship with the school. The service offers two morning sessions per week. In early 2012, the Ministry of Education relicensed the centre under the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008 to cater for up to 30 children per session, including 10 under two years old. Eighteen children are currently enrolled in the playcentre.</p><p>The playcentre&rsquo;s philosophy promotes family involvement in children&rsquo;s learning. Positive features of the centre include respectful, caring relationships, and opportunities for parents to further their knowledge and understanding of early childhood education. A particular aim of the centre is to foster children&rsquo;s confidence, creativity and curiosity. There has been an emphasis on increasing members&rsquo; awareness of bicultural perspectives, which are now evident throughout the centre. Since the 2010 ERO review, parents have engaged in comprehensive whole-centre professional development to improve programme planning and assessment.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation and the association provide governance and support for the centre. The association promotes success for M&#257;ori as M&#257;ori through training initiatives and Puriri o Whakamaru, a group that encourages and funds local and national leadership initiatives. A recently appointed and experienced liaison officer is employed by the association to support the centre with regular advice and guidance for centre operations and curriculum development.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in six early childhood education services within the Thames Valley/Coromandel Playcentre Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn alongside caring and knowledgeable adults who know them well. A warm family-like atmosphere fosters positive interactions that promote children&rsquo;s social skills. Experienced adults engage in learning conversations that extend children&rsquo;s thinking and problem solving. There are many opportunities for children to make choices and sustain their play. Children&rsquo;s sense of belonging is nurtured through established, well-planned transition processes when entering the centre and moving to school. These features contribute to a calm and settled culture of mutual respect among children, adults and extended families.</p><p>Indoor play areas are well presented to give children ready access to a wide range of good quality equipment and materials. Attractive displays encourage exploration and provide opportunities for children to revisit and discuss their learning with peers and interested adults. Children have opportunities to use mathematics and literacy skills in meaningful every-day contexts, and to make sense of the natural and material world around them.</p><p>Recent whole-centre professional development has had a positive impact on assessment, planning and evaluation. Centre members have developed an effective and streamlined session evaluation framework that enables parents to identify important aspects of the programme and to guide future planning. This is an efficient, manageable process for documenting learning in a timely and useful way. Portfolios contain models of high-quality assessment that record children&rsquo;s learning, progress and participation in the programme.</p><p>Playcentre leaders have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities. They have developed effective processes for annual planning, financial management and self review. Experienced centre members model good teaching practice and provide opportunities for distributed leadership. The liaison officer provides parents with positive feedback and helpful next steps for continuing improvement. The recent review and restructuring of the association&rsquo;s governance and management processes is resulting in more professional contact with the centre. Higher priority on the quality of education leads to improved learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and playcentre leaders agree that priorities for development and review are to:</p><ul>
<li>further empower children to participate in directing their own learning and assessment</li>
<li>provide regular opportunities for older children to sustain and extend an interest over time</li>
<li>increase the explicit and meaningful integration of the language, culture and heritage of all centre members.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kaiaua/Miranda Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>22 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
