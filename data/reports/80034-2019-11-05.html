</table><p align="center" style="text-align: left;">Teviot Valley Educare Centre Inc is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Teviot Valley Educare Centre Inc is in the rural town of Roxburgh and licensed for 30 children including up to six aged under two. It provides all-day education and care for children from the surrounding area, from Monday to Friday.</p><p>Children aged over two play and learn in several interconnecting rooms. The infants and toddlers have a larger room that has been refurbished to meet their needs. Redevelopment of the outside environment is planned.</p><p>The service is governed by a community-based committee made up of parents. A centre manager, who is also the head teacher, runs the day-to-day operations along with the support of an assistant head teacher. Together they form an experienced leadership team. There have been some other changes in teaching staff since ERO's 2016 review.</p><p>The centre's philosophy and valued learning outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>manaakitanga - showing care and respect for others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kaitiakitanga - respect for the environment through sustainable practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whanaungatanga - widening relationships with peers, teachers and in the community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rangitiratanga - self-help skills which develop independence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whakamanawa - self-confidence, curiosity and emotional robustness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>turangawaewae - a positive sense of self and cultural identity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The centre has made good progress in addressing the key next steps identified in the 2016 ERO report, particularly in the areas of internal evaluation and governance capability.</p><p>Teviot Valley Educare is now a member of the Dunstan Kāhui Ako|Community of Learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are very well engaged in their play and learning. They are settled and responsive to their teachers. The curriculum is varied and aligned to their interests. The programme supports identified valued outcomes including opportunities for:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>literacy and early mathematics learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>art and dramatic play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learning in the natural world including gardening and caring for the environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>development of physical skills.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The community is used well to support the centre's curriculum with local events and excursions regularly included in the programme. The teaching and learning of science concepts and skills is carefully 'woven' into the programme by teachers. Teachers have a range of ways to keep parents informed about the many ongoing programmes and events.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have clearly identified the centre's priorities for children's learning and linked these to Māori perspectives. It is now timely for leaders and teachers to review the weekly four-year-old programme, from the perspective of the valued learning priorities.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well provided for. Their environment is thoughtfully designed and provides calm, stress-free learning and care. Children can explore and develop their physical skills, play and learn with others and make choices. Teachers have warm and respectful relationships with them. They are attuned to their verbal and non-verbal cues and understand their needs well. They are responsive to their daily care routines. Teachers deliberately use conversations to promote children's language development.</p><p>There is a useful system for planning for the learning of all children. Teachers use a framework for assessment that is monitored and analysed centre-wide. Planning for groups of children is responsive. Useful reflective questions support evaluation of programmes and children's learning. Teachers should continue to deepen their responses to these questions. They could more consistently collect and use parent voice in planning for their children's learning. This would better promote parents as partners in planning their child's learning.</p><p>Leaders have a strong focus on developing and supporting teachers' professional practice. They are empowering all teachers. They actively seek and prioritise professional learning and development for them. Leadership is deliberately promoted. Other key features of leadership at this centre include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the focus on improvement through reflective practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>willingness to learn and be adaptive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>networking with other organisations to support positive outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Internal evaluation is used effectively to guide centre improvement and outcomes for children. It is relevant to the centre's context and carried out by all teachers. Policy and spontaneous reviews, as well as planned reviews, are thoughtfully completed. Going forward, the team need to reactivate a system for longer term review planning, beyond policy reviews.</p><p>The governance committee is well-informed about centre operations. It has developed a very useful strategic plan which members are beginning to monitor more frequently. An appropriate focus is placed on financial sustainability, staff development and the resourcing of the centre. Useful systems and processes are in place to help guide the work of the committee. It is continuing to foster strong community engagement and plan for the succession of its members. The committee could know more about the centre's valued outcomes for its children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers need to strengthen ways parents can have opportunities to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>have input into the centre's strategic plan and policy review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>share aspirations for their children's learning and have input into planning for their learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Teviot Valley Educare Centre Inc completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Action for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance.</p><p>The service provider must ensure that emergency procedures are reviewed annually.</p><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS7]</em></p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>5 November 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
