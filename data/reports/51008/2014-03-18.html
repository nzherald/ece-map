<a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Background</span></h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Mangaweka Playcentre governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the November 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>programme planning and assessment practices</li>
<li>self-review processes</li>
<li>bicultural curriculum provision and programmes for infants and toddlers</li>
<li>processes to support understanding of adults’ roles and responsibilities</li>
<li>property matters relating to the indoor learning environment and facilities for children and parents/families</li>
<li>compliance areas</li>
<li>other issues relevant to the governance, management and operation of the centre.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Mangaweka Playcentre is one of 22 playcentres under the Central Districts Playcentre Association (the association). The playcentre is located in a small rural community and is the only early childhood education provider in the local area. Since the November 2012 ERO report, the association liaison officer and centre personnel have been working closely to address ERO’s concerns.</p><p>Improvements to several aspects of centre operation and practices have had positive outcomes for children and their families. These include developments of assessment and planning processes, programme responsiveness to infants and toddlers, establishing formal self-review processes and opportunities for involvement in relevant professional learning.</p><p>In March 2013, as a result of the property and compliance matters identified in the previous ERO review, the association sought an external building report. The findings of this report highlight significant health and safety concerns that require urgent action.</p><h3>Programme planning and assessment practices</h3><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>Playcentre personnel have developed assessment and planning practices that are increasingly focused on recognising and responding to individual children’s learning. Access to professional support, visits to other playcentres, and establishing good practice examples have been useful in growing these practices.</p><p>Recent initiatives, such as wall displays, inform parents of the assessment and planning cycle, and include ideas and ways for adults to contribute to each child's learning.</p><h4>Areas for further improvement</h4><p>Centre leaders identify that they should further develop assessment and planning practices for children’s learning. Strengthening the daily session evaluation form is a next step, so members more clearly focus on the learning that has occurred, and how they will respond through the programme.</p><h3>Self review</h3><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>The centre has established self-review processes. ERO saw evidence of changes that were made to resourcing as a result of internal reviews. Changes include the ways in which adults make purposeful resourcing decisions to support and encourage children’s interests. An ongoing formal review of the building issues is helping to guide centre decision-making.</p><h4>Areas for further improvement</h4><p>Centre personnel should continue to further develop their understanding of review processes and practices that focus on teaching and learning.</p><h3>Roles and responsibilities</h3><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>Processes have been established to better inform and guide parents about expectations of playcentre, and of a parent cooperative. A sense of teamwork is evident. Parent interest in the association course training has increased.</p><h3>Programme responsiveness</h3><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>There are a few opportunities for children to hear Māori language through greetings and basic use of te reo Māori. Recent initiatives, such as a mihi mihi display and the regular use of te reo Māori by the session supervisor are helping to build bicultural understanding.</p><p>Infants and toddlers have easy access to an environment that is well resourced and encourages a range of sensory experiences. ERO observed many children engaged in their play for sustained periods. Older and younger children have regular opportunities to play with and alongside each other. Children and families show a positive sense of belonging. Adults are actively involved during the session.</p><h4>Areas for further improvement</h4><p>Adults are aware they need to make further progress in ensuring children know about the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p><h3>Property and compliance matters</h3><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>A structural inspection in March 2013 found the building in ‘generally poor condition’ with a number of significant health and safety issues identified. A planned review of building matters has been ongoing since the November 2012 ERO report. The review is assisting adults to make decisions about issues relating to the premises.</p><h4>Areas for further improvement</h4><p>The association needs to urgently address the issues identified in the structural inspection in March 2013. An action plan is required that includes specific timelines for addressing all health and safety aspects.</p><a id="3-recommendation-to-other-agencies" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Recommendation to other agencies</h2><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Mangaweka Playcentre. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><a id="4-actions-required-for-compliance" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Actions Required for Compliance</h2><p>In order to meet its agreed accountabilities, centre management must:</p><ul>
<li>ensure all parts of the building or buildings used by children have adequate lighting, ventilation, and effective acoustic absorption materials</li>
<li>ensure there are sufficient hand washing/drying facilities intended for use by children</li>
<li>ensure that premises, furniture, furnishings, fittings, equipment, and materials are kept safe, hygienic and maintained in good condition</li>
<li>ensure the designated assembly areas for evacuation purposes do not unnecessarily place children at further risk.</li>
