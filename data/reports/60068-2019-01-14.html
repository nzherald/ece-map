</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Premium Preschool, also known as P2, is a privately owned centre located in Heretaunga, Upper Hutt. It is licensed to provide education and care for 23 children aged over two years. Of the 24 learners currently enrolled, 3 identify as Māori. Children from a range of other ethnic groups attend.</p><p>The owner manages the centre and works alongside the teaching team. All staff are long term employees.</p><p>The programme is aligned to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and there is a focus on supporting children for entry to school.</p><p>ERO’s May 2014 report identified priorities for improvement which included developing self review, linking strategic planning to appraisal and promoting success for Māori and Pacific learners. Progress in these areas is evident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The organisation of the learning spaces has been carefully considered to support children’s interests. Open-ended and natural play materials promote imagination and creativity. The outdoor space provides opportunities for children to learn about the environment and be involved in more physically challenging experiences. The environment is highly reflective of te ao Māori and the cultures of children attending.</p><p>Teachers purposefully engage with children to support and further develop their learning. Staff know the children and actively respond to their emerging interests. Literacy, numeracy and arts are clearly promoted and evident in all aspects of the centre. Learning is collaboratively decided between children and teachers, and a mix of child-led and adult-initiated activities enhances their developing knowledge. Children are provided with useful feedback which acknowledges their evolving skills. Regular excursions into the local area are highly valued, provide strong links to the community and extend learning opportunities for children. These also promote a sense of belonging.</p><p>Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are evident in the centre. Teachers are using te reo Māori and children are increasingly responding.</p><p>A comprehensive approach to planning the programme is in place. This is driven by the valued learning outcomes identified in the philosophy. Parent aspirations are valued and evident in children’s documentation. Learning portfolios are attractively presented and are readily accessible for children. Some clearly show progress over time.</p><p>Teachers, the centre owner and manager show a strong commitment to the philosophy, vision and goals of the service and are highly committed to their respective roles. Staff are supported by a useful appraisal process and a range of professional learning opportunities.</p><p>It is timely to review the current philosophy to ensure it is better aligned to the valued outcomes of the service. There is a strong focus on celebrating, supporting, and promoting the culture, language and identity of all children. The local community is important to the centre. These aspects should be reflected in the documented philosophy and linked to <em>Te Whāriki</em> <em>2017.</em></p><p>Leaders establish a culture where children and their families are valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are and what they bring. Appropriate provision is in place for children with additional learning needs. External agency support is sought if needed.</p><p>Children’s transitions into, across and from the centre are whānau and child-led and well considered to support successful progressions. Strong relationships with local schools promote children’s understanding of the next stage of their learning pathway.</p><p>Review is used to inform decision making. A number of spontaneous reviews have led to positive changes for children. A framework for planned internal evaluation is in place. To strengthen this process consideration should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the implementation of a more evaluative process, supported by better defined and measureable indicators of success</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing shared understanding of the process to more clearly know the impact of actions on outcomes for learners.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and teachers agree that their priority next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review the current philosophy to capture the programmes emphasis on culture, language and identity, and strong connection to the local community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a shared understanding and use of internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Premium Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Premium Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>14 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
