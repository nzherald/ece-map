</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tawhiti Kindergarten is situated in Hawera, Taranaki. It is one of 24 kindergartens administered by the newly established Kindergarten Taranaki, formerly North and South Taranaki Kindergarten Associations. The governing board is responsible for setting overall strategic direction and policy for the organisation. A chief executive has been appointed. Four professional leaders are employed to support learning and development of teachers. The present management structure is under review.</p><p>The kindergarten is licensed for 40 children and has a roll of 34. Mixed-age sessions operate from 8.30am to 2.30pm. All teachers are qualified and registered.</p><p>Key features of the kindergarten include a focus on relationships, physical environment and building of a learning community. Inclusive and respectful practices nurture partnerships with children and their families. Teachers and wh&#257;nau contribute items to a sharing table for all to access.</p><p>Ongoing development of the natural outdoor environment continues to evolve. The principles of &lsquo;reduce, reuse and recycle&rsquo; are promoted through &lsquo;Education for Sustainability&rsquo;.</p><p>The stable teaching team have worked deliberately to continue to improve the quality of teaching practices and centre operation.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergarten reviews in Kindergarten Taranaki.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children&rsquo;s learning is well supported in an inclusive, spacious and vibrant environment. Natural materials and resources are provided and offer children challenge and encourage exploration and risk taking. The atmosphere is unhurried and purposeful. Morning tea and lunch are shared social times, when children and adults eat and talk together. Children are supported to take increased responsibility for the wellbeing of themselves, others and the environment.</p><p>Teachers are welcoming of parents and wh&#257;nau. Relationships amongst children and with adults are caring and responsive. Children are independent learners who confidently approach others and share their ideas. They make choices about their learning and sustain their play. Teachers provide meaningful contexts for children to develop and learn about literacy, mathematics, and science and natural world understandings.</p><p>The bicultural curriculum continues to strengthen. Teachers use M&#257;ori symbols and artefacts to promote learning about Aotearoa New Zealand&rsquo;s dual cultural heritage. Teachers and leaders acknowledge that they need to further grow their knowledge and understanding of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori.</p><p>The centre has developed an effective process that supports planning and assessment. Teachers notice and recognise children&rsquo;s interests, strengths and needs. They plan collaboratively to provide opportunities and experiences for children&rsquo;s further learning. Children&rsquo;s continuity of learning and progress over time is very evident in portfolios. Parents and children contribute to these through sharing links between learning at kindergarten and home.</p><p>Strong partnerships with local schools support successful transitions for children and their families. A local network of early childhood and new entrant teachers helps them to develop shared understandings of continuity of learning and links between principles and concepts expressed in <em>Te&nbsp;Wh&#257;riki,</em> the early childhood curriculum and <em>The New Zealand Curriculum.</em></p><p>A useful process guides appraisal and performance management. Development goals are aligned to centre priorities and the Registered Teacher Criteria. Teachers work collaboratively to support each other to work towards and achieve their goals</p><p>Self review effectively guides improvement of practice, enhances learning opportunities for children and informs environmental developments. A comprehensive strategic plan clearly identifies the centre&rsquo;s goals and priorities for improvement. Review of this plan has noted ongoing progress in relation to expected outcomes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><ul>
<li>The head teacher has identified a next step is to seek ongoing aspirations from parents about their children&rsquo;s learning. This should further strengthen partnerships to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</li>
<li>Strengthen self review by including a stronger evaluative focus on how change impacts on children&rsquo;s learning and wellbeing.</li>
</ul><h3>Kindergarten Taranaki Key Next Steps</h3><p>Kindergarten Taranaki is a new entity established in March 2014. Collaboratively developed strategies and values guide future direction. An internal review of capacity and capability of non-teaching roles has been completed. Further development of processes and practices is required.</p><p>ERO, the chief executive and professional leaders agree that priorities for improvement are:</p><ul>
<li>developing the annual plan</li>
<li>strengthening systems and processes for performance management</li>
<li>consistent implementation of appraisal</li>
<li>reviewing and clarifying professional leaders&rsquo; role in building teachers&rsquo; capability.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tawhiti Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tawhiti Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>14 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
