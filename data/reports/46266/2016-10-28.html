</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids Create Limited 1 was established in 2013 as one of four home-based education and care networks, in Auckland, owned by the same service provider. It is licensed to provide an early childhood education and care service for up to 80 children from infancy to school age. Educators provide programmes in their homes for up to four children at a time. Children come from diverse, mostly Pacific, cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The programme coordinator is a registered early childhood teacher. She and the auditor regularly visit educators in their homes and support them to plan educational programmes for children as well as monitoring health and safety provision. Key aspects of the service's philosophy include provision of a culturally responsive curriculum underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, awareness of the Treaty of Waitangi, and learning through play.</p><p>The service provider/owner works as part of a governing board in managing the service. The board works collaboratively with the programme coordinator, auditor, relationships managers and educators.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Educators are appreciative of the support and opportunities for ongoing training that they receive from the programme coordinators. Documentation shows that children are happy, confident and have warm relationships with educators. Children's ideas are valued and educators are responsive to parent aspirations. Parents give positive feedback about the education and care their children receive. There is a shared belief in the benefits of home-based learning for children and their families.</p><p>Educators provide a culturally responsive curriculum that nurtures children's language, culture, and identity. Most of the educators speak the same first language as the children in their care. Educators include learning opportunities in planned experiences, day-to-day household activities and excursions. They keep good records of the children’s day and note activities that they enjoyed. This reflects the service's philosophy, which prioritises children learning through play and supports children's emotional and physical wellbeing.</p><p>There is an organisational culture of trust and respect at all levels. Relationships between the service leaders, educators and parents are responsive, supportive and caring. Programme coordinators promote good teaching practice in home visits, encourage training and record their discussions with educators. They are improvement focused and eager to continue increasing educator capability and the use of te reo and tikanga Māori in homes. Good communication keeps parents informed and involved.</p><p>Service leaders prioritise positive educational outcomes for children. They work in culturally appropriate and transparent ways to share information and develop learning partnerships with educators, whānau and the community. Purposeful internal evaluation has been established and is beginning to help service leaders to maintain good practices and to research ways to develop their practices further. Children's wellbeing is at the heart of internal review and service operations.</p><p>Service leaders have a strong commitment to developing a high quality home-based education service. Their philosophy and vision are evident across all service practices and policies. They have an ongoing commitment to bicultural development and Pacific success. Comprehensive documentation outlines clear guidelines and high expectations for educators. Robust health and safety systems provide assurance that expectations are being monitored. A more evidence based appraisal, aligned with the Practising Teacher Criteria, would help the programme coordinator and other staff to enhance their own professional practice.</p><p>The board has developed effective management and administration systems. These align with the service's philosophy, vision and mission and the government’s <em>Pasifika Education Plan 2013-2017</em> (PEP). This plan is aimed at raising Pasifika learners’ participation, engagement and achievement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service leaders agree that key next steps for the service would be to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen strategic planning to be more focused on outcomes and linked to internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>continue to build on educator capability, including in developing planning that is responsive to children’s individual emerging interests and ideas</li>
<li>explore ways to strengthen internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids Create Limited 1 completed an ERO <em>Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to: </p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids Create Limited 1 will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>28 October 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
