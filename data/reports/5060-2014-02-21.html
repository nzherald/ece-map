</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kauri Park Kindergarten is located in Birkenhead, Auckland, and offers education and care for a maximum of 40 children over the age of two years. It has recently implemented the kindergarten day model (KDM) where most children attend sessions that match school hours. The kindergarten philosophy incorporates a strong focus on children learning through play, and having opportunities to grow in confidence as competent learners and communicators.</p><p>A new head teacher was appointed during 2013 and is ably supported by a recently formed teaching team of four qualified teachers and an administrator and a teacher aide. A helpful parent committee supports the team by fundraising and organising family events.</p><p>Teachers have responded positively to the previous ERO report and have continued to implement self-review processes for ongoing improvement to the programme for children.</p><p>The kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA). The Association provides policy, procedural and operating guidelines. It also provides teachers with regular, topical professional development and on-going support from professional services managers (PSM).</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and families are warmly welcomed to the kindergarten. Children settle quickly and make confident choices about their play. They are articulate and confidently engage in conversations with each other and with adults. Children persist at activities for prolonged periods of time as there are many opportunities to explore and problem-solve. They are supported to incorporate reading, writing and mathematics in their play.</p><p>Teachers use good strategies at the beginning of the day to set the foundation for learning and play. They make good use of information and communication tools to share children's interests or extend their knowledge.</p><p>A feature of the learning programme is the focus on sustainability. Respect for the environment, each other and kindergarten resources is emphasised. Good use is made of the indoor space to motivate and stimulate children's play. The attractive outdoor area provides physical challenge for children and encourages imaginative play.</p><p>Teachers have an emphasis on strengthening partnerships between the kindergarten and the community. Parents have opportunities to contribute to policy and programme review. Parents report that they are comfortable contributing to the kindergarten’s programme.</p><p>Teachers continue to gain confidence in integrating bi-cultural practices. Aspects of tikanga Maori are evident in the environment and teachers promote te reo Māori through song and conversations with children.</p><p>The learning programme reflects <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and aligns to the kindergarten’s philosophy and vision statement. Teachers have made purposeful adjustments to the programme to respond to the length of time most children now attend the kindergarten. Teachers have also made useful improvements to children's assessment records to make children's learning, strengths and interests more clearly evident. Teachers have recently implemented good strategies to support children as they move to school.</p><p>The new head teacher has managed the changes to the KDM well. She has implemented strategies that have resulted in a positive team culture and has promoted leadership opportunities among the newly formed team. Teachers have recently reviewed the philosophy and are using it as a foundation document to inform the strategic direction of the kindergarten. There is evidence of a clear alignment between the philosophy and the programme in action.</p><p>The Auckland Kindergarten Association continues to provide strong governance for kindergartens. The recent establishment of nine focus groups provides a forum for head teachers to extend their leadership skills and contribute to the ongoing development of the Association. Strengthening self review in kindergartens remains a focus for PSMs, with workshops planned to involve whole teaching teams. Association leaders agree that planned improvements to the teachers’ appraisal process in 2014 could include developing a means to link teachers’ goals with positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The kindergarten has identified that their next steps are to enhance self review by:</p><ul>
<li>including a greater balance of children’s and parents' input alongside teachers' contributions</li>
<li>evaluating the impact of areas under review on outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>In order to further build on current good practice the PSM and head teacher have also identified, and ERO agrees, that teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>continue to increase their confidence in promoting bi-cultural practices</li>
<li>consider ways of improving educational success for Pacific children. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kauri Park Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Kauri Park Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>21 February 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework<a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"> Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
