</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Twinkling Stars is a small privately owned centre licensed for 15 infants and toddlers under two years of age. The centre is located in Birkenhead, in a two-storey converted house. It has been open for 20 years and was previously known as Oak Tree Childcare. Ownership changed in April 2013, and the centre has also had staffing changes in the last eighteen months.</p><p>The centre philosophy is underpinned by shared values and beliefs that outline the service’s desired outcomes for children. The philosophy is evident in practice. Children’s positive sense of self is developing on a foundation of secure relationships between, children and teachers and teachers and families.</p><p>The supervisor, who is a long serving teacher, has provided continuity through the period of staffing changes. She is well-known to families. All teachers are qualified. The service has good recruitment and induction processes to support new staff and provisionally registered teachers.</p><p>The owner employs an external agency that provides effective support to govern and manage the centre. Useful self review frameworks are guiding ongoing improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Twinkling Stars Childcare is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children. A core curriculum based on children’s interests underpins the programme. Music, dance and creative play choices support infants and toddlers’ learning development. Teachers are also focussed on an emerging curriculum and are responsive to the interests of individuals and groups of children. Assessment records provide good descriptions of children’s learning dispositions and stages of development.</p><p>Children are curious, confident and highly engaged learners. Children’s learning through play is respected and valued. Teachers are available to infants and toddlers, supporting them in their learning. Children are empowered to take increasing responsibility for the wellbeing of themselves, others, and the group.</p><p>Children’s speaking skills are encouraged. Teachers support children’s language development through interpreting and responding to the cues offered by infants and toddlers. Teachers respectfully talk with children about decisions that affect them.</p><p>Well resourced indoor areas invite children’s exploration and equipment is easily accessible. The main play area is upstairs with a small deck available for outdoor play. The spacious lower outdoor area is accessed by children and teachers via a stairwell. Although this is not ideal, exploration and exercise is encouraged. Teachers are undertaking a review of this space to make it more attractive with enhanced learning opportunities for children.</p><p>Teachers have been reviewing bicultural practices at the centre and are developing their own confidence to use te reo me ōna tikanga Māori. Centre leaders acknowledge the importance of reflecting a commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand in the centre’s philosophy.</p><p>Teachers have inclusive relationships with parents and regularly discuss with them their child’s development. Parents and whānau are consulted and centre leaders have responded to some of their aspirations. It would be useful to collate and use this consultation information to help plan strategically for ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that to further enhance centre operations and practice, self-review and other processes should continue to be formalised. Areas for review could include:</p><ul>
<li>documenting policies and procedures that support the place of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and bicultural practices</li>
<li>continuing to refine planning, assessment and evaluation processes to support children’s individual interests and to include parents’ perspectives</li>
<li>deciding on strategic goals to guide teaching and learning development and organisational management and evaluating the impact of these goals to strengthen self review and inform future planning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Twinkling Stars Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Twinkling Stars Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>20 December 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
