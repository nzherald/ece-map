</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kaukapakapa Playcentre is governed and managed cooperatively by centre members, who support each other in their parenting and educator roles. The centre caters for up to 30 children, including 15 under two years of age. It offers three sessions per week, including a newly introduced off-site nature session. The sessions all feature child-initiated play in a mixed-age group. They affirm the Playcentre philosophy of parents as their children's first educators, and the value of play-led learning.</p><p>The centre's 2013 ERO report highlighted high quality management and leadership that promoted ongoing improvement. The report included recommendations relating to the programme, parent training and raising the centre's community profile. The Playcentre has undergone some marked challenges since that time. Long attending, experienced members have moved on and the roll has dropped by over half. Despite these factors, the Playcentre continues to be a viable choice for families. New parents have moved into leadership roles and have made very good progress in addressing ERO's 2013 key next steps.</p><p>The centre is part of the newly established Northern North Island Playcentre Region. Regional systems support centre members to manage their centres and to provide educational programmes for their children. Playcentre personnel also provide training programmes for parents/whānau to achieve Playcentre qualifications.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine playcentre reviews in the Northern North Island Playcentre Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Kaukapakapa Playcentre is very well resourced and well maintained. Its attractively landscaped grounds encourages exploration that is meaningful and enjoyable for children. Parents/whānau and children also make use of the extensive community grounds and facilities nearby. The indoor play areas promote children's imaginative and creative play. There is a separate space in which infants are able to explore safely and independently.</p><p>Children display a strong sense of belonging and ownership in the centre. They learn in a calm, peaceful and positive atmosphere. They are confident learners and are empowered to take responsibility for their own wellbeing and to care for others and the environment.</p><p>Effective planning supports parents/whānau to provide well designed programmes that reflect the Playcentre philosophy. The child-initiated programme is thoughtfully implemented and provides many opportunities for children to make choices, experience challenge and engage in a wide variety of activities. Parents/whānau write learning stories that are authentic records of children's learning and interests. These records are used to plan further experiences.</p><p>Interactions between children and adults are meaningful and help extend children's learning. Parents are proactive and perceptive in identifying and responding to children's emerging interests and needs. Children benefit from relationships with adults that support their learning and development in positive and holistic ways. Children under the age of two enjoy high quality care. They are included in learning opportunities and are nurtured in an inclusive and caring environment.</p><p>The centre is well led. Centre members' commitment to working cooperatively with a shared sense of purpose promotes positive outcomes for children. Thoughtful, strategic leadership empowers parents and utilises their skills and knowledge. Members have planned a variety of future developments. These include focusing on sustaining good practices, meeting new challenges and attracting new families. Members demonstrate the capability necessary to promote such ongoing improvements.</p><p>Playcentre course work and opportunities for professional learning have successfully increased adults' individual and collective capacity to further support all children. Members are very ready to access further Playcentre qualifications, when these become available.</p><p>Regional leaders have a strong commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. They are building links with local kaumatua and promote bicultural partnerships. Whānau Māori are invited to join te Roopu Ngātahi o Puāwai. The inclusion of te reo and tikanga Māori is an integral part of centre practices that affirm Māori children’s cultural identity. Kaukapakapa Playcentre is increasingly promoting and implementing the bicultural underpinnings of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early learning curriculum.</p><p>The regional structure is replacing individual Playcentre Associations. Newly appointed regional personnel are making good progress building on existing systems and establishing effective regional management structures for supporting centres. Centre support workers are guided by regional centre support coordinators. Systems are being developed for monitoring the quality of programmes for children, adult education levels, and health and safety requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre members are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue with the strategic plans already underway to cater more directly for older children and to better reflect the bicultural curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adapt the philosophy statement to capture the unique features of this centre.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kaukapakapa Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kaukapakapa Playcentre will be in four years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>8 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
