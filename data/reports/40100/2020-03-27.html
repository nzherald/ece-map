</table><p>Natures Cove Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Natures Cove Early Learning Centre is a privately-owned centre located in <span lang="mi">Otumoetai,</span> a suburb of Tauranga. It is licensed to provide education and care for 42 children from three months to school age including 17 children up to the age of two years. The current roll of 43 children includes four who identify as Māori. Three learning spaces provide for the needs of infants, toddlers and young children.</p><p>The service is one of two in Tauranga under the same ownership. An experienced teacher from within the centre was appointed centre manager in 2019. She is responsible for the day-to-day management of the centre. A mentoring position has recently been developed to support teacher practice in both Tauranga centres. There have been a number of staff changes since the last ERO review in 2016.</p><p>The centre’s <span lang="mi">kaupapa</span> prioritises kindness, commitment and love in a 'team environment.' Children explore through authentic experiences in a natural environment where relationships with <span lang="mi">Papatuanuku</span> are valued. The aim is to develop lifelong learners.</p><p>The centre responded positively to the recommendations in the 2016 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience an environment that supports a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing. Respectful relationships amongst children and adults support learning and care in a purposeful learning environment. Inclusive practices ensure children with additional needs and catered for. The teaching team work collaboratively with parents and support services to ensure these children have every opportunity to experience success.</p><p>Children are encouraged to follow their interests and revisit their learning. Teachers value children’s ideas and build on these to create effective learning opportunities. Oral language development is well supported through extended conversation and the use of effective questioning strategies for all age groups.</p><p>Positive sensitive and responsive interactions enable children under two to develop a sense of belonging. Teachers maintained a calm slow pace where younger children have time and space to lead their learning. Teachers utilised the learning opportunities within the daily routines.</p><p>Children experience a range of rich and varied learning opportunities. These include multiple opportunities to explore science, literacy and numeracy concepts. There is a focus on the outdoors, using a range of natural resources and maximising the use of flexible learning spaces. The use of the local environment to extend learning opportunities is a valued part of the programme.</p><p>Bicultural practices are increasingly being authentically integrated into the three learning areas. Leaders and teachers are incorporating local myths and legends and beginning to explore stories specifically related to the local area. Further development in bicultural practice has been identified and prioritised by the centre.</p><p>Transitions into, through and onto school are thoughtfully planned, flexible and responsive to each child's needs.</p><p>Individualised planning builds on children’s interests and ideas. Each child's learning journeys is captured in portfolios, both in hard copy and online and in accessible displays and project books in the centre. Teachers continues to refine their assessment methods to ensure consistency of practice. Leaders and teachers should consider how they can further evaluate how well the curriculum is achieving the expected outcomes for children.</p><p>Leaders are committed to effective teaching and learning that contributes to positive outcomes for children. The clear vision is supported by the collaboratively developed philosophy, strategic and annual planning. Collegial relationships based on trust and a supportive team culture enhance the opportunities for children to learn. Professional learning and development is actively supported to enable teachers to grow their capability. Ongoing evaluation of teaching and learning practices result in positive change that supports the learning of all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for leaders and teachers are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>build on and embed bicultural practices centre-wide</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refine planning and assessment practices centre-wide to ensure a shared consistent practice. This will enable leaders and teachers to more effectively evaluate how well the centre curriculum is meeting children’s needs.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Natures Cove Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to Premises and Facilities.</p><p>All indoor and outdoor items and surfaces, furniture and equipment and materials are safe and suitable for their intended use.</p><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, PF5]</em></p><p>The centre rectified the identified compliance matters whilst ERO was onsite.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Acting Director Review and Improvement Services (Central)</p><p><span>Central Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Pūtahi Nui</span></span></p><p>27 March 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
