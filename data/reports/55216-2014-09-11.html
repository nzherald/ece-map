</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ormond Kindergarten is situated on the grounds of Ormond School, in a rural setting near Gisborne, and provides education and care for children from two to five years of age. This early childhood service was previously known as Ormond Rural Preschool. In March 2012, the Gisborne Kindergarten Association (the association) took over the governance of the preschool. The premises were rebuilt in July 2012.</p><p>The kindergarten is licensed for up to 34 children including five children up to two years, and operates for six hours, Monday to Thursday and four hours and fifteen minutes on a Friday. There will be a change to the kindergarten licence from August 2014, to operate as an over two service only. Seventy eight percent of the enrolments attend part time.</p><p>The teaching team is fully qualified and is supported by a teacher aide. This is the first report under the governance of Gisborne Kindergarten Association. Two senior teachers are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers. Since coming under the umbrella of the association, professional support for teachers has been provided focusing on assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four kindergartens in the Gisborne Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy focuses on relationships, persistence and problem solving, humour, curiosity, communication and being an active learner. It is strongly evident in teaching practice and the curriculum.</p><p>Children participate in a child-led, play-based programme. Teachers know children well and work alongside children providing support and an extension of ideas specific to the individuals. There are many opportunities for children to be recognised as experts and to share their knowledge with others. Children work for sustained periods of time and play cooperatively with their peers. They have fun in the programme.</p><p>Teachers' interactions are warm, welcoming and respectful. They use a range of effective strategies to engage children in play and learning. They are flexible in the approach they take in responding to the needs and routine of children who are up to two years of age. Teachers support children’s developing social and emotional competence. Where appropriate, they work with external agencies supporting children with additional learning needs.</p><p>Children’s mathematical learning is enhanced through meaningful and interesting opportunities to use mathematics in everyday life and through the use of open-ended resources for exploration. Teachers' further investigation into the knowledge and language of mathematics should strengthen children’s mathematical learning.</p><p>Transition into the kindergarten is child focused. Expectations of all parties are clearly established. Teachers support children and families in their transition to school by providing relevant, timely information and visits to the local school.</p><p>At times te reo Māori is spoken by teachers and aspects of appropriate tikanga observed. However, ERO and the association believe this approach should continue to be strengthened. In addition, teachers should develop a shared understanding of what success for Māori as Māori might look like in this context.</p><p>The head teacher leads a collaborative team. Curriculum design and implementation is effectively led. Planning is responsive to children’s interests. This process should be strengthened through teachers being more evaluative in their approach.</p><p>A range of assessment approaches show children’s participation, developing friendships and learning. Multiple approaches are used to liaise with families in designing an appropriate programme of learning for their child. Assessment information should be strengthened through stronger alignment between the goals set and the range and clarity of information gathered to inform goal setting and subsequent enactment. Learning and progress overtime should be made clearer in assessments documents for families.</p><p>Self review is developing. Teachers should continue to strengthen their understanding of the self-review process and their knowledge of evaluation. This should provide additional information to judge the effectiveness of kindergarten operations and practice and inform future decision making.</p><p>The association provides high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>robust guiding documents and comprehensive policies</li>
<li>clear expectations for programme delivery and kindergarten operations including health and safety practices</li>
<li>strong leadership</li>
<li>professional learning and development for staff</li>
<li>sound supporting processes for Provisionally Registered Teachers.</li>
</ul><p>Senior teachers should undertake strategic review and evaluation across the association and use this information to inform decision making. They should also support teachers to build their evaluative capacity to regularly enquire into the effectiveness of their practice to further improve positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Since the first cluster of these kindergartens the association has reviewed the implementation of the appraisal process. A revised approach is beginning to be put into practice and formal documentation is developing.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the key next steps are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>the bicultural programme and exploring what success for Māori as Māori means in this kindergarten's context</li>
<li>self review.</li>
</ul><p>The association's key next step is to:</p><ul>
<li>undertake formal strategic self review at association level.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ormond Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ormond Kindergarten will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>11 September 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
