<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Richmond is one of 63 kindergartens (including on early learning centre) administered by Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens. The kindergarten has changed its hours of operation. It is open from 8.45 am to 2.45&nbsp;pm five days a week, to better meet the needs of the community. The kindergarten is licensed for 40 children over the age of two years.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten is well supported by the association and the education service manager. The head teacher provides strong leadership to a team of dedicated teachers. Together, they deliver high quality education and care for children.</p><p align="left">The teaching team, with association support, has made significant progress in addressing the recommendations from the 2005 ERO review. Bicultural practices have been a focus of the team&rsquo;s self review and professional development. Children are benefiting from the inclusion of more te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in the programme. Multicultural practices have also improved. Teachers have introduced a number of initiatives that sensitively acknowledge and celebrate the children&rsquo;s cultural backgrounds.</p><p align="left">With the ongoing support of the association, self review is developing well as a means of improving teaching and learning. Teachers are developing a culture of reflective practice. They work together for the benefit of children.</p><p align="left">Children play and learn in a well-organised environment. Children and adults relate warmly and positively to each other. Teachers interact effectively with children to engage them in their learning and to promote their social skills.</p><p align="left">A particular strength of the kindergarten, is the way teachers promote children&rsquo;s ownership of their learning through their play. The children are encouraged to share responsibility for the direction of the programme. They have many leadership opportunities. As a result, they are becoming confident communicators who are highly engaged in their learning programme. This programme incorporates a variety of rich experiences across the curriculum. The children&rsquo;s ongoing learning and development are well captured in the detailed records and displays produced at the kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Other noteworthy features of the kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>a strong focus on the development of children&rsquo;s literacy skills;</li>
<li>the children&rsquo;s confident use of a wide range of information and communication technologies (ICT) to support their learning;</li>
<li>the many opportunities available to parents to be partners in their children&rsquo;s learning; and</li>
<li>the effective use of community resources to enrich the children&rsquo;s learning within and outside the kindergarten.</li>
</ul><p align="left">There is scope for the kindergarten to develop more effective professional links with local schools to support children&rsquo;s transition to school. The knowledge and skills the children will bring to their ongoing education could usefully be shared with a wider audience.</p><p align="left">During the course of the review, ERO identified no areas of non compliance. The teaching team makes good use of the association&rsquo;s systems to provide a healthy and safe environment for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Richmond was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergartens Richmond.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><a id="the-quality-of-education" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>The Quality of Education</h2><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The kindergartens&rsquo; programme philosophy states that teachers will provide a rich learning environment, based on children&rsquo;s interests, where they will develop skills, knowledge, independence and respect for others. Teachers encourage children to learn through play within a programme that has an emphasis on literacy and ICT.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4>Environment</h4><p align="left">Children benefit from a well-resourced and organised homely environment. They are actively involved in learning through play in a stimulating and challenging learning programme that includes a range of information and communication technologies (ICT).</p><p align="left">An attractive, natural outdoor area provides many opportunities for children to extend on their physical skills and learn about the natural world.</p><h4>Interactions and relationships</h4><p align="left">Positive and reciprocal relationships between adults and children foster a strong sense of belonging for the children. Teachers know the children and families well. They provide a relaxed and inclusive atmosphere which encourages parents to spend time at the kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Children are confident to initiate interactions with adults and other children. They are cooperative and enjoy the company of others.</p><p align="left">Teachers take an interest in children and respond to them with warmth and affection. They focus on supporting children&rsquo;s learning through effective interactions that engage children in their learning.</p><p align="left">Fostering links with the community is an integral feature of the programme. Teachers plan purposeful activities and trips into the local area. They involve community volunteers and secondary school students regularly in the programme.</p><p align="left">Teachers actively encourage parents to participate in the life of the kindergarten. They provide many opportunities for families to share their views, skills and experiences to the programme. Teachers value parents&rsquo; contributions to children&rsquo;s understandings of different cultures.</p><h4>Learning programme</h4><p align="left">Children demonstrate high levels of engagement in the programme and ownership of their own learning. Children&rsquo;s opinions are respected and their ideas are valued. Teachers provide timely responses to children&rsquo;s interests to enable them to take on leadership roles in the programme, such as planning and leading group times.</p><p align="left">Children are confident communicators who demonstrate high levels of self esteem. Teachers empower children to be independent, to take responsibility and share their knowledge with others. Teachers foster an inquiry approach to learning that involves children asking questions and seeking solutions in a variety of ways.</p><p align="left">Teachers promote a strong focus on literacy in the programme. Literacy is purposefully integrated across the curriculum in ways that are meaningful to children. The use of ICT is a key feature that guides the organisation, planning and delivery of the programme. Teachers empower children to develop new understandings, knowledge, skills and the ability to use a wide range of ICT resources to communicate their learning.</p><p align="left">Children and parents/wh&#257;nua have many opportunties to revisit and discuss children&rsquo;s current interests and involvement in the programme:</p><p align="left">Children benefit from the provision of a variety of rich learning experiences across the curriculum that enable them to develop their knowledge and skills. These experiences are supported by initiatives that foster children&rsquo;s learning in literacy and ICT and make strong links to Te Wh&#257;riki, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum.</p><h4>Area for development</h4><p align="left">Teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next step to further improve learning outcomes for children is to make stronger professional links with local schools. This relationship is likely to better support the development of a transition-to-school process that has yet to be formalised. There is scope for the teachers to share some good early childhood practices that could benefit local schools&rsquo; understanding of prospective new entrants&rsquo; knowledge and skills, particularly in relation to literacy and ICT.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long-term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h4>Literacy Teaching and Learning</h4><p align="left">When children understand, enjoy, engage with, and use language and symbols they are better able to express their individual identity and become active participants in a literate society. As part of this review, ERO looked at literacy practices, particularly the opportunities provided for children to develop strong literacy learning foundations.</p><p align="left">In this service, children&rsquo;s literacy learning included regular, planned and spontaneous opportunities for developing:</p><ul>
<li>listening and speaking skills, through a programme focus on inquiring into their learning, sharing and revisiting this in one-to-one, small group and whole-group situations;</li>
<li>reading skills, through easy access to a wide range of reading material ,including participation in a library outreach programme, and a story reading programme staffed by volunteers;</li>
<li>early writing skills, through the use of a range of writing tools and opportunities to be involved in meaningful activities, for example, children developing plans for group times and documenting their own ideas on their work;</li>
<li>visual skills, through a wide range of photos and texts including other languages enable children to revisit significant happenings;</li>
<li>technological skills, through supported involvement in making their own books, slide shows and movies; and</li>
<li>collaborative partnerships between teachers, children, and families to encourage children to become competent and confident literacy learners.</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-richmond" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">To the Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Richmond</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kidsfirst Kindergartens Richmond.</p><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Richmond is one of 63 kindergartens (including on early learning centre) administered by Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens. The kindergarten has changed its hours of operation. It is open from 8.45 am to 2.45&nbsp;pm five days a week, to better meet the needs of the community. The kindergarten is licensed for 40 children over the age of two years.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten is well supported by the association and the education service manager. The head teacher provides strong leadership to a team of dedicated teachers. Together, they deliver high quality education and care for children.</p><p align="left">The teaching team, with association support, has made significant progress in addressing the recommendations from the 2005 ERO review. Bicultural practices have been a focus of the team&rsquo;s self review and professional development. Children are benefiting from the inclusion of more te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in the programme. Multicultural practices have also improved. Teachers have introduced a number of initiatives that sensitively acknowledge and celebrate the children&rsquo;s cultural backgrounds.</p><p align="left">With the ongoing support of the association, self review is developing well as a means of improving teaching and learning. Teachers are developing a culture of reflective practice. They work together for the benefit of children.</p><p align="left">Children play and learn in a well-organised environment. Children and adults relate warmly and positively to each other. Teachers interact effectively with children to engage them in their learning and to promote their social skills.</p><p align="left">A particular strength of the kindergarten, is the way teachers promote children&rsquo;s ownership of their learning through their play. The children are encouraged to share responsibility for the direction of the programme. They have many leadership opportunities. As a result, they are becoming confident communicators who are highly engaged in their learning programme. This programme incorporates a variety of rich experiences across the curriculum. The children&rsquo;s ongoing learning and development are well captured in the detailed records and displays produced at the kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Other noteworthy features of the kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>a strong focus on the development of children&rsquo;s literacy skills;</li>
<li>the children&rsquo;s confident use of a wide range of information and communication technologies (ICT) to support their learning;</li>
<li>the many opportunities available to parents to be partners in their children&rsquo;s learning; and</li>
<li>the effective use of community resources to enrich the children&rsquo;s learning within and outside the kindergarten.</li>
</ul><p align="left">There is scope for the kindergarten to develop more effective professional links with local schools to support children&rsquo;s transition to school. The knowledge and skills the children will bring to their ongoing education could usefully be shared with a wider audience.</p><p align="left">During the course of the review, ERO identified no areas of non compliance. The teaching team makes good use of the association&rsquo;s systems to provide a healthy and safe environment for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p></html>
