</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Raizem (Ltd) Homebased Care &amp; Education is located in Rotorua and was established in 2015. It provides full-day education and care for children from birth to school age. It is licensed for 30 children, including five up to the age of two years. There is currently one qualified educator who provides education and care for four children all of whom are of Māori decent. The service's owner manages the organisation and provides professional leadership and guidance to the educator.</p><p>The centre's vision aims to provide high-quality education, support and care for children and their whānau. The centre believes in the importance of working with whānau and communities to raise competent and confident children who are strong in their sense of identity and belonging. Te reo and tikanga Māori are integrated into all aspects of the service. The centre's philosophy has four main areas of focus, whakamana - empowerment, kotahitanga - holisitic development, whānau tangata - family and community and ngā hononga - relationships.</p><p>This is the first ERO review for this service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The curriculum responds effectively to the language, culture and identity of Māori children. Children’s hapū and iwi knowledge is used to create personalised learning. There is a strong sense of whanaungatanga. This enables effective collaboration and implementation of a holistic curriculum, based on te ao Māori in a total immersion environment. Planning and assessment is linked to children’s individual whakapapa. Children experience a sense of belonging and connectedness to their cultural heritage.</p><p>Teaching strategies support children’s wellbeing, learning and development. There are positive and caring relationships between the educator and children in her care. Children’s independence is fostered through hands on activities, exploration and problem-solving. There is a strong focus on oral language development in te reo Māori. Children are happy and nurtured in a caring, family, home environment.</p><p>Children up to the age of two have their care needs and routines well met. The educators respect children’s rights and talks to them about decisions that will affect them. Effective transitions into this homebased service, meet the ongoing needs of children and their whānau.</p><p>The experienced manager has a clear vision and philosophy for the service. She has strong relationships and works collaboratively with the educator, parents and whānau. Positive liaison with external agencies provides additional support for children with special needs. There is regular monitoring of the quality of care and education for children in the service. Guidance and feedback is provided to the educator to develop her confidence and capability in her new role. Māori children and their whānau benefit from leadership that is responsive to their needs and aspirations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the leader and educator are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop a strategic approach to internal evaluation to inform planning and direction for the service and continue to improve outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop planning and assessment to identify goals and learning outcomes for children and monitor these over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Raizem (Ltd) Homebased Care &amp; Education completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>document the ongoing process of self-review to help the service maintain and improve the quality of its education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider ways to improve children’s access to and safety in the wider outdoor environment.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Raizem (Ltd) Homebased Care &amp; Education will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>11 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
