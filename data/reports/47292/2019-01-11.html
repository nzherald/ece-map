</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ignite Homebased ECE is a private home-based education and care early learning service operating in the Whanganui area. The service is licensed for 50 children. Of the 21 children enrolled, 18 are Māori.</p><p>One qualified and certified teacher works alongside educators to assist them to implement care and learning programmes for children in homes. A qualified and certified manager is responsible for overseeing service operation.</p><p>The philosophy underpinning teaching and learning emphasises the importance of valuing te ao Māori within the context of Whanganui; and meeting each child's unique needs.</p><p>Three of the five current educators are fluent in te reo Māori and tamariki receive learning in this kaupapa Māori based context.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of Ignite Homebased ECE.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service philosophy values the importance of the provision of a localised curriculum in which the core values of manaakitanga, whanaungatanga and kotahitanga are upheld.</p><p>Children enjoy opportunities to participate in a range of learning experiences in educators' homes and the local community. Genuine opportunities to enact tikanga and local kawa are made available through scheduled Ignite-organised playgroups and spontaneous visits to marae.</p><p>Children's placements and transitions in to and out of the service are well-considered in collaboration with parents. Strong links with and regular visits to local schools promote children's understanding of transitions to Kura Kaupapa Māori.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported to fully engage with the programme.</p><p>A focus on promoting strong and purposeful relationships with whānau is evident. Communication channels are well facilitated through regular pānui, and on-line platforms. Whānau are well informed about ngā tamariki participation and aspects of their learning through the coordinator's monthly visits and reports.</p><p>Te ao Māori and tikanga are strongly evident in children's pukupuka and through educator and coordinator dialogue. Assessment documentation notes the developing interests of tamariki. Photographs show their enjoyment in learning. The coordinator should continue to strengthen educators' practice particularly in relation to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>identifying, recording and extending the significant learning taking place in both planning records and visit reports. This should link to the te ao Māori influence which is at the forefront of Ignite's localized curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whānau input and feedback and planning that meets their aspirations.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Programmes for ngā puna kōhungahunga supports their sense of wellbeing and belonging. Tuakana teina influences learning through role modelling tikanga and te reo Māori.</p><p>Work has been undertaken to implement the revised curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki,</em> with educators. A more cohesive approach is required by leaders and educators to align <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the service philosophy and their curriculum, Ngā Pae e Rima, in assessment and planning practices.</p><p>Regular visits by the coordinator give suitable attention to ensuring compliance requirements and Ignite expectations are met. Educator practice is monitored and ongoing guidance is provided. Good support is provided for educators' further learning and development through the provision of professional development, webinars and training opportunities.</p><p>An appraisal procedure linked to the <em>Standards for the Teaching Profession</em> supports coordinator practice. In future consideration should be given to implementing a more inquiry-based process linked to child outcomes.</p><p>Useful annual appraisals occur for educators. These include educators reflecting on their practice and setting long and short term goals linked to the service philosophy. Strengthening the quality of feedback, in relation to their practice, is required.</p><p>A number of spontaneous reviews undertaken have led to positive outcomes for children. Effective internal evaluation practice is not well understood. A suitable framework is in place, however further work is needed to deepen leaders' understanding and use, to better inform decision making about improvement.</p><p>Well organised governance and management supports the operation of Ignite Homebased ECE. Clear reporting and responsibilities are evident. Quality assurance is prioritised, effective and well implemented. An annual plan suitably guides the service's operation. Useful support is provided to the coordinator and educators to successfully carry out their roles.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment and planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementation of <em>Te Whāriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ignite Homebased ECE completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>• curriculum</li>
<li>• premises and facilities</li>
<li>• health and safety practices</li>
<li>• governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ignite Homebased ECE will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>11 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
