<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Settlement Road Kindergarten in Papakura is well placed to continue to improve positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Settlement Road Kindergarten is part of the Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association (CMKA). The Association&rsquo;s clear vision sets the direction for the Kindergarten. Strategies to achieve this vision include responsiveness to wh&#257;nau contributions and bicultural practices. The Association has a commitment to high quality care and education.</p><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s teaching team work collaboratively to develop a holistic programme for children. They draw good support from the families of the local community. Since the 2009 ERO review, the kindergarten&rsquo;s licence has been increased to provide for 40 children.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in six early childhood education services within the Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association (CMKA) umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten is well established and well resourced. The large outdoor playground is well designed to support and encourage children&rsquo;s learning through creative exploration. A large veranda ensures that maximum learning space for children is available all year round.</p><p>The kindergarten is well governed and managed. Professional support for the well qualified team of registered teachers is ongoing and useful. Specific initiatives and personnel in both the Association and the kindergarten promote te reo me &#333;na tikanga M&#257;ori and are strengthening children&rsquo;s understanding about te ao M&#257;ori.</p><p>Teachers value children as competent and capable learners. Children are encouraged to be self-managing and make choices for their play. Children experience a wide range of social experiences that support them in establishing close friendships with each other, and developing their communication skills. Aspects of literacy and mathematical concepts are naturally included into children&rsquo;s play.</p><p>A particular strength of the centre&rsquo;s curriculum is an emphasis on waiata, te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori which is enthusiastically embraced by children. The head teacher provides effective leadership in this area of the programme.</p><p>The equity funding that the kindergarten receives is well used to support opportunities for young children to learn within the spacious outdoor learning environment and through carefully planned trips in the local community that focus on new and meaningful experiences.</p><p>Teachers encourage wh&#257;nau contributions and are responsive to their views and aspirations for their children&rsquo;s learning. Positive relationships between teachers and their families promote open communication and support children and their wh&#257;nau to feel welcome and supported. A well managed transition programme supports children and their wh&#257;nau to settle quickly into the kindergarten and later into the school environment.</p><p>The Association&rsquo;s professional practice manager (PPM) team leads teachers in ongoing reflection on the quality of the kindergarten practices. Teachers are well positioned to continue developing self review processes that inform their practices.</p><p>Teachers have also identified several areas for ongoing review and improvement. ERO agrees that teachers&rsquo; next steps for development should include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening the documentation, depth and processes of self review</li>
<li>further developing their assessment practices to include wh&#257;nau aspirations and more clearly identify children&rsquo;s learning and progress over time</li>
<li>further building their knowledge of tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori and continuing to enhance multicultural inclusiveness in the kindergarten</li>
<li>continuing to foster children's skills in positive social interactions</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Settlement Road Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>11 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
