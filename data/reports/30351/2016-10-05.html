</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Creative Kids Preschool is a privately owned centre in Te Kuiti. It is licensed for 24 children and in October 2014, it was relicensed to include up to 8 children under 2. About one third of the children are of Māori descent. At the time of this ERO review there were 26 children on the roll. Children learn and play in a mixed-age, family-like setting.</p><p>The leadership team includes the owner/manager and the head teacher. There is one other permanent staff member as well as two part-time educators. Staffing organisation ensures that the focus on quality ratios and small numbers remains a priority. Two thirds of the teaching staff are qualified in early childhood education.</p><p>Centre leaders have responded positively to the areas for further development in the 2013 ERO report. They have engaged in professional learning and development and strengthened processes about transitions to school. They have also attended workshops with local iwi to extend their knowledge and understandings in relation to Maniapoto protocols and history.</p><p>The centre is guided by a well-written strategic plan with clear objectives. Self review is well embedded and there are strong, positive relationships with parents and whānau. The centre philosophy is regularly reviewed and aims to provide a holistic, child-centred programme fostering self-care and independence, enriching children with the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa, and engaging parents in their child's learning and progress.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Creative Kids Preschool is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Children learn and play in a warm and welcoming, family-like setting. They willingly approach visitors to the centre and speak confidently about their learning and play. Tuakana-teina relationships encourage older children to support and help younger ones. Children are happy and well engaged in learning activities supported by their teachers.</p><p>Infants and toddlers experience responsive and supportive care giving from teachers who know them and their families well. Known and predictable routines support their sense of security and independence. The indoor environment is spacious and well presented to invite children into play. There is easy indoor outdoor flow that allows babies and toddlers the opportunity to safely experience and explore the natural environment outdoors. Children confidently choose resources and initiate their own learning activities.</p><p>High quality interactions between children and teachers are respectful, responsive and calm. This allows children the opportunity to use their own language and offer explanations. Sustained teaching moments extend children’s thinking and value their contributions. Teachers listen carefully to children's ideas and working theories, and ask appropriate questions. They also provide affirming feedback to children.</p><p>Literacy and numeracy are strongly promoted by teachers. Teachers engage in deliberate acts of teaching to ensure that children have many opportunities to develop knowledge and skills in a range of learning areas including mathematics, reading, writing, science, creative arts, music and imaginary play. Transitions to school are competently managed and teachers gain assurance that children settle in well to school.</p><p>Te reo and tikanga Māori practices are visible, heard and embedded throughout the centre curriculum, documentation and activities. Teachers introduce learning contexts that include Māori themes and history from the local area. Māori children and their whānau have their language, culture and identity acknowledged and respected, and Māori staff contribute to the building of bicultural perspectives.</p><p>Teachers observe children's learning activities and record this learning regularly in rich and meaningful learning stories and evaluations. These observations and evaluations record children's development and progress over time, and establish next steps for ongoing learning. Parents are encouraged to contribute to planning for future directions for individual children and for the centre as a whole. Teachers make links to the objectives and strands of <em>Te Whariki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and explain these to parents.</p><p>Centre leaders work collaboratively with staff and parents. Leaders have clear roles and responsibilities which reflect their complementary skills and expertise. They establish high expectations for centre safety and hygiene, effective organisation, and good quality documentation to support policies, procedures and strategic direction. They also model and encourage effective teaching strategies and relationships, and grow teacher capability through mentoring and appraisal, especially for new teachers.</p><p>Self-review processes are well developed, evidence-based, purposeful and focused on improving outcomes for children. Centre leaders consult with children and whānau, and use theory about good practice in early childhood education to support their findings. They regularly review the centre philosophy to align their values and beliefs with their current practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has suggested that next steps for ongoing development should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>using evidence gathered from meetings, reflections, assessment, professional learning and self review to evaluate progress in relation to strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using Māori perspectives and concepts about what the child brings to their learning to enhance assessment practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Creative Kids Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Creative Kids Preschool will be in four years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>5 October 2016</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
