</table><p>Oromahoe Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Oromahoe Kindergarten operates in a rural district close to Kerikeri. It is licensed for 25 children over two years of age. Younger children are cared for in the nursery and transition into the kindergarten at three years of age. The shared playground provides space for all children's play.</p><p>Within the last two years the kindergarten philosophy has been reviewed and changed to include te reo Māori me ōna tikanga, a strong focus on aspects of Steiner teachings and <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The centre manager works with a team of two qualified teachers and two unqualified helpers. An administration assistant undertakes many centre support roles. The Bay of Islands Waldorf Education Trust, made up largely of whānau of children attending the kindergarten, provides governance support.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children attending the kindergarten demonstrate a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging. They freely move between the indoor and outdoor areas, choosing their play from a wide range of natural materials and opportunities to explore new learning. Recent work and developments have made a significant positive impact on both the indoor and outdoor areas to make the learning environment calm and effective in supporting learning.</p><p>Teachers' interactions with children are authentic and meaningful. They listen to children's ideas and respond patiently. Learning words in children's home languages helps teachers to settle children with English as an additional language. Teachers' gentle support helps all children to feel included and valued.</p><p>Teachers are intentional in their teaching. They co-construct learning experiences with children, supporting their curiosity, experimentation and creativity. Children use New Zealand Sign Language as part of their conversations. These teaching and learning practices are building children's knowledge of themselves as successful learners. Teachers pay special attention to children that they know have additional needs.</p><p>Children respond positively to other children. They play together in cooperative groups with high levels of conversation and collaboration. Tuakana/teina relationships, with older children modelling and supporting their younger peers, are highly evident.</p><p>Teachers have established strong partnerships with whānau. Regular conversations and contributions from whānau in children's Golden books, enable teachers to know children very well. This results in individual planning that embraces children's strengths, interests and abilities, and supports whānau aspirations for their children.</p><p>Teachers and children form sound relationships with the local community. Regular trips outside the centre, including visits to local farms and the ngāhere, provide opportunities for children to broaden their understanding of the wider world and to learn about others' work. A focus on sustainability provides opportunities for children to learn about recycling and re-purposing materials.</p><p>Te reo Māori me ōna tikanga are part of daily practice. Children show their understanding and confidence in using te reo. They share their pepeha, sing waiata and use te reo words and phrases. The kindergarten environment clearly demonstrates teachers' intent to celebrate the principles of te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><p>Internal evaluation is ongoing, and responsive. Teachers have undertaken significant work to strengthen this aspect of their practice. Regular monitoring of changes in response to internal evaluation findings has improved outcomes for children. The policy and procedural framework now provide comprehensive information for teachers and whānau. The kindergarten is well placed to continue to sustain quality practices.</p><p>Teachers' appraisal processes are up-to-date and provide opportunities for teachers to access professional learning and development (PLD). Teachers have engaged in PLD that has helped them to provide successful science learning opportunities for children, and that sometimes includes teachers from other centres.</p><p>The passion and commitment of the leaders in the kindergarten contributes considerably to improved systems and programmes. There is a high level of relational trust between teachers and whānau. Children benefit from equitable learning opportunities and a revitalised programme embedded in <em>Te Whāriki</em>.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers agree that they should continue to build and support the quality learning for children already evident in the daily curriculum.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Oromahoe Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>9 October 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/"></a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
