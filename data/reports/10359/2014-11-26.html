</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tippytoes Childcare is a privately owned centre in Pakuranga, East Auckland. It continues to provide high quality education and care for children up to school age.</p><p>The centre was established ten years ago. Since that time, its premises have been extended to include two neighbouring houses. These have been renovated to provide a homely environment that is well suited to children’s needs. The centre is licensed for 40 children, including a maximum of 20 under the age of two years. Its three separate spaces provide attractive and spacious areas for infants, toddlers and preschoolers.</p><p>The largest ethnic group of children attending the centre are New Zealand European. There is a much smaller numbers of Chinese and children from other cultures.</p><p>The centre employs 15 teachers and there is a high ratio of adults to children. Four teachers are currently undertaking training and seven are working towards full teacher registration. In the past year, management has implemented a new team structure. This helps to develop leadership and strengthen centre sustainability.</p><p>The owner/manager and assistant manager have made good progress in addressing the areas for development noted in the centre’s 2011 ERO report. They have also sustained the significant strengths acknowledged in that report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are valued and respected as individuals. They demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing. This is promoted by the calm, settled environment established by staff. Children feel secure and content. They happily engage in play and conversation with each other and adults.</p><p>Children have ready access to a range of good quality resources and equipment. This encourages their creativity and curiosity. They have opportunities to explore a range of play areas, to follow their interests, and to experience challenge. Many children engage in sustained play and are able to develop their knowledge and skills.</p><p>Managers take an active role in teaching and modelling the high expectations they have of teachers. Together with staff, they demonstrate a strong commitment to the centre philosophy and to implementing effective teaching practices. As a result, children are involved in play that is appropriate for their age, developmental stage and goals.</p><p>High staffing ratios enable teachers to provide individualised programmes for infants and toddlers. Teachers communicate and work very well together as a team. They are responsive to the particular needs of infants and toddlers. Infants experience caring and nurturing interactions with staff and show trust in their teachers. Toddlers have many opportunities to develop language and skills at their own individual pace.</p><p>Teachers engage children in meaningful conversations that lead to real learning experiences. Early literacy, science and some mathematics learning is integrated through spontaneous play and project work. Children are becoming increasingly confident about asking questions and solving problems.</p><p>The curriculum promotes success for Māori and Pacific children. Teachers have improved their use of te reo Māori. They respond to whānau aspirations for their children. Aspects of te reo and te ao Māori are integrated into the environment and programme. Centre managers agree that they should continue to strengthen their bicultural practices to further support success for Māori children.</p><p>Staff also share their first language strengths to help children who speak Mandarin. This helps children to feel at home in the centre and contribute to strengthening relationships with their families. Teachers include a range of cultural experiences and languages in the programme.</p><p>Teachers provide an inclusive learning environment that supports positive outcomes for all children. They work alongside external agencies and families, taking a shared approach to supporting children with special needs. The progress these children make in achieving their goals is regularly monitored and shared with their families.</p><p>Teachers are continually growing their curriculum knowledge. They do this through shared discussion and professional learning and development. Teachers take time to observe children, to know them well and follow the directions they take in leading their own learning.</p><p>Planning and assessment records are very well documented to support the centre’s emergent curriculum approach. Learning stories successfully highlight children’s voices and detail children’s learning and development. Managers have recently implemented online portfolios. This is helping to foster more transparent communication and shared input from families. Teachers are continuing to develop their reflective practice to provide improved outcomes for children. Managers are committed to strengthening curriculum evaluation to further promote and support learning.</p><p>Centre managers provide very effective leadership and strategic direction. They are fostering an environment where children learn and develop to the best of their ability. Staff benefit from managers' collaborative leadership style. The staffing structure has been reviewed to distribute leadership among staff and to strengthen the centre sustainability. There is very good support for teachers through mentoring, team sharing, professional development and appraisal. Managers have appropriately reviewed the appraisal process to ensure that it is well linked to the registered teacher criteria.</p><p>Managers have an ongoing focus on supporting children to be capable and confident learners. They have a comprehensive understanding of systematic self-review for continual improvement. The centre is very well placed to continue to provide a high quality service for children and their families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers agree that self-review could continue to be strengthened by:</p><ul>
<li>increasingly including teacher and parent perspectives in the review process</li>
<li>refining and improving the review documentation processes, including evaluations of the impact of the curriculum on children’s learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tippytoes Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tippytoes Childcare will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>26 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
