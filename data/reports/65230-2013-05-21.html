<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Golden Bay Kindergarten is developing its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children. Progress is well supported by good governance from the association and guidance from the Senior Education Adviser.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Golden Bay Kindergarten has recently had a number of changes to the teaching team. A new head teacher is employed. Staff are working closely with Nelson Kindergarten Association (the association) to consolidate the team's practice. The kindergarten is licensed for 39 children aged two years and over. At the time of the review, there were 65 children enrolled. The kindergarten has a bronze enviroschool award.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Nelson Kindergarten Association (the association) and overseen by a team of Senior Education Advisors (SEAs). The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in eight early childhood education services within the Nelson Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are warm, welcoming and responsive to children, parents and wh&#257;nau. Partnerships are based on acceptance, respect and willingness to listen and change. A wide range of opportunities are available for children to develop an understanding of, and explore learning through the living world. This focus is valued by the kindergarten community.</p><p>Teachers engage in sustained conversations with children about matters that are of interest to them. They draw on a wide range of effective teaching strategies to support and extend learning. Teachers support the development of children&rsquo;s social and emotional competence. Routines respond to children&rsquo;s individual needs.</p><p>The programme is child centred. Children are engaged in sustained play for extended periods of time. Teachers are open to new learning about local iwi, their history and sites of significance and they incorporate this information into the programme. Tikanga M&#257;ori is promoted. The environment offers opportunities for children to take safe risks and challenge themselves physically. Teachers actively promote positive and friendly interactions between children. They play collaboratively and independently.</p><p>The transition to school process is in the early stages of development. Teachers acknowledge that while informal conversations occur, they are not formally documented.</p><p>Teachers communicate effectively with parents and wh&#257;nau. Parents spoken with feel well informed about kindergarten activities. They are encouraged to take an active role in their child&rsquo;s learning and share their skills in the programme. The curriculum is underpinned by the early childhood curriculum <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>.</p><p>Planning is responsive to children&rsquo;s interests. The process is recently developed and continues to be refined. Parents are regularly invited to contribute to the planning.</p><p>Portfolios are well presented. These acknowledge children's learning and highlight their participation and developing friendships. There is a good level of parent feedback captured in the portfolos.</p><p>Teachers are committed to bicultural practice. Some te reo M&#257;ori is integrated into the programme.</p><p>Teachers are supported in their understanding of self review by the association. There is strong alignment between the guiding documents of the association and kindergarten and the resulting review. Spontaneous review has been well used to improve outcomes for children.&nbsp; The teachers and association are highly consultative, regularly requesting feedback from their parent community.</p><p>The association has recently updated its appraisal procedures to provide clear guidance for staff. Leaders are engaging in ongoing professional learning in this area to support its successful implementation.</p><p>The association provides high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>clear guiding documents</li>
<li>expectations for programme delivery and kindergarten operations including health and safety practice</li>
<li>access to a wide range of professional learning and development opportunities</li>
</ul><p>The SEA regularly visits the kindergarten and provides strong support and leadership to the teaching team. Through SEA guidance and identified next steps teachers are supported to enact the association&rsquo;s vision of providing &ldquo;consistently exceptional early childhood education&rdquo;.</p><p>Equity funding is used effectively to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>reflect parents&rsquo; aspirations through the learning stories, revisit these regularly to show how teachers are responding and how the child is progressing</li>
<li>specify how teachers plan to extend children&rsquo;s learning through the planning and assessment process</li>
<li>introduce regular reviews into the kindergarten&rsquo;s processes</li>
<li>continue to strengthen the use of te reo me nga tikanga M&#257;ori to further promote bicultural practices within the kindergarten</li>
<li>continue to build the evaluative capacity of teachers to systematically enquire into and judge the effectiveness of their kindergarten operations. This should assist future decision-making and identify priorities to further enhance children's learning and wellbeing.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Golden Bay Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>21 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
