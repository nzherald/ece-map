<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Woodville Playcentre is located in Woodville. It is a parent-led centre that operates under the umbrella of the Central Districts Playcentre Association (the association). Children and their families are offered education and care for two sessions each week. Members have developed a philosophy statement which is unique to this centre and is underpinned by the national playcentre philosophy.</p><p>Children participate enthusiastically in a programme that is responsive to their interest and needs. Parents effectively plan programmes by noticing, recognising and responding to children&rsquo;s strengths and emerging interests. Children&rsquo;s involvement in activities and learning are recorded in their profiles.</p><p>Children learn and play in a setting where relationships are warm and welcoming. Adults know them well and effectively share responsibility for their care. Children work and play cooperatively with their peers. They readily initiate conversations with adults. Children have easy access to resources that encourage independence as they explore and investigate the environment. They demonstrate a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>Centre members work collaboratively to promote relationships that support all involved. Adults are positive role models and they actively develop their skills in facilitating learning.</p><p>A feature of the centre is involvement of fathers as rostered parent helpers within the programme sessions and as office holders. New families are welcomed and inducted in a planned and considered way.</p><p>Since the July 2008 ERO review, the centre has made good progress with addressing the areas identified for improvement. In particular, providing a centre programme aligned with playcentre philosophy, and developing language-learning conversations to extend children&rsquo;s thinking, reasoning and problem solving.</p><p>Centre personnel and ERO agree that the next steps for review and development are to continue to improve assessment, build self-review practices and increase the integration of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori within the programme.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Woodville Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atWoodville Playcentre.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Woodville Playcentre&rsquo;s philosophy focuses on supporting, affirming and challenging children. Adults work collaboratively to build children&rsquo;s learning and development.</p><p>Since the previous review, there has been a complete change of personnel, including office holders, and association staff. A collegial and collaborative approach has resulted in positive changes to programme and relationships. Two paid co-facilitators attend both sessions each week, working alongside parents and children. Most parents are involved in playcentre adult education courses.</p><p>The centre is working towards becoming licensed under the Education (Early Childhood Centres) Regulations 2008.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><h5>Programme</h5><p>Parents effectively plan programmes by noticing, recognising and responding to children&rsquo;s strengths and emerging interests. Planning for learning is a collaborative process that considers contributions from parents and their observations of children&rsquo;s interests. Parents evaluate the programme acknowledging children&rsquo;s involvement in activities.</p><p>Adults are highly responsive to supporting children&rsquo;s learning interests. They support adult-initiated and spontaneous independent play and learning. Parents sensitively facilitate children&rsquo;s learning as they work alongside children, supporting their exploration and dramatic play. Literacy and mathematics learning is enhanced through authentic and meaningful contexts. Children&rsquo;s sense of independence is promoted.</p><p>A friendly and inclusive tone fosters involvement and creates a sense of belonging for children and their families. Parents&rsquo; skills and expertise are used to support the programme and children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s individual profile books are attractively presented and are a good record of their participation in a wide range of activities and learning experiences. Wall displays help parents to understand the playcentre philosophy, the assessment and planning process and Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum.</p><h5>Environment</h5><p>The warm and welcoming environment encourages children&rsquo;s exploration, wondering and problem solving. The indoor environment is well resourced and includes areas and activities which promote literacy, mathematics, art, dramatic and creative play. Children capably access a wide range of materials and equipment that are responsive to their interests. They take pleasure in discovering and investigating in their surroundings.</p><h5>Interactions</h5><p>Children respond positively to the adults&rsquo; view of them as capable and competent learners. Relationships between parents and children are caring and responsive. Families are made to feel warmly welcome. Children settle well at activities of interest with, and alongside, others. They share ideas confidently, develop friendships and play together for sustained periods of time. Children and adults work together, have fun and enjoy each other&rsquo;s company.</p><p>Parents effectively support children&rsquo;s oral language and conversation skills. They make good use of questioning to help children build on their thinking and problemsolving ability. Children&rsquo;s independence and self-help skills are fostered. Positive expectations and guidance support children&rsquo;s social learning.</p><p>A collegial and collaborative approach by parents has resulted in many constructive changes to the centre programme. Adults work cooperatively and communicate effectively with each other, supporting positive outcomes for all children.</p><h5>Management and leadership</h5><p>Centre management processes and systems support and guide operations effectively. Policies reflect playcentre philosophy and provide clear guidelines that support centre programme and practice. A culture of distributed leadership is developing with a planned approach to include all parent members.</p><p>There is a good level of shared understanding about the roles and responsibilities of office holders. Co-facilitators effectively lead and model good practice as they work alongside adults and children.</p><p>A strategic plan has been cooperatively developed to support consistent practice and to improve outcomes for children. It has links to the centre philosophy and to self review. Many examples of spontaneous and planned self review demonstrate a commitment to improvement.</p><p>A well-organised appraisal process is implemented. It includes all components of successful, improvement-focused performance management practice.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><h5>Assessment</h5><ul>
<li>
<p>Guidelines have been established to support the writing of learning stories. Although there are some examples of good practice, the quality of assessment for learning in children&rsquo;s portfolios is variable. Continuing to upskill parents to record learning should ensure that these stories consistently add to the overall learning experience for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h5>Bicultural programme</h5><ul>
<li>
<p>Members acknowledge the need to increase integration of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori within the programme to create an environment that truly reflects New&nbsp;Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage.</p>
</li>
</ul><h5>Self review</h5><ul>
<li>
<p>Centre personnel identify the need to continue to develop their understanding and use of self review as a tool for improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Woodville Playcentre completed an ERO <span>Centre Management Assurance Statement</span> and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-woodville-playcentre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Woodville Playcentre</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Woodville Playcentre.</p><p>Woodville Playcentre is located in Woodville. It is a parent-led centre that operates under the umbrella of the Central Districts Playcentre Association (the association). Children and their families are offered education and care for two sessions each week. Members have developed a philosophy statement which is unique to this centre and is underpinned by the national playcentre philosophy.</p><p>Children participate enthusiastically in a programme that is responsive to their interest and needs. Parents effectively plan programmes by noticing, recognising and responding to children&rsquo;s strengths and emerging interests. Children&rsquo;s involvement in activities and learning are recorded in their profiles.</p><p>Children learn and play in a setting where relationships are warm and welcoming. Adults know them well and effectively share responsibility for their care. Children work and play cooperatively with their peers. They readily initiate conversations with adults. Children have easy access to resources that encourage independence as they explore and investigate the environment. They demonstrate a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>Centre members work collaboratively to promote relationships that support all involved. Adults are positive role models and they actively develop their skills in facilitating learning.</p><p>A feature of the centre is involvement of fathers as rostered parent helpers within the programme sessions and as office holders. New families are welcomed and inducted in a planned and considered way.</p><p>Since the July 2008 ERO review, the centre has made good progress with addressing the areas identified for improvement. In particular, providing a centre programme aligned with playcentre philosophy, and developing language-learning conversations to extend children&rsquo;s thinking, reasoning and problem solving.</p><p>Centre personnel and ERO agree that the next steps for review and development are to continue to improve assessment, build self-review practices and increase the integration of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori within the programme.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
