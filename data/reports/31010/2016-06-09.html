</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pukeatua Playcentre is a parent-led centre located near Te Awamutu, providing education and care for children from birth to school age. The centre is licenced for 25 children including 10 up to two years of age. At the time of the ERO review, 19 children were enrolled, two of whom identify as Māori. Currently, there are a total of three sessions per week, two mixed-age sessions and one session to cater for older children. Due to the recent increase in the number of babies, parents have decided to have only one mixed-age session to meet the needs of parents and whānau.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of King Country Playcentre Association (KCPA). It is affiliated to the New Zealand Playcentre Federation (NZPF). They provide the centre with effective governance, strategic direction, management support and adult education programmes. The centre's practice is based on the guiding principles of the NZPF philosophy. This provides a commitment to te Tiriti o Waitangi and values productive partnerships with Māori.</p><p>The playcentre programme places strong emphasis on children and parents learning together through play, in a safe and supportive environment. Members aim to build a sense of belonging in the community for children and adults, and assist children to develop as socially competent and confident learners.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO report, the centre has made some progress with the areas for development. Parents have worked effectively to attract new members in order to improve the centre's sustainability. Long-serving parents have encouraged others to participate in playcentre courses at appropriate levels. A significant number of these parents now have Level 3 course qualifications.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four playcentre reviews in the King Country Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Babies, toddlers and young children, and their parents and whānau demonstrate high levels of enjoyment, belonging and wellbeing. Children of all ages have many opportunities to choose and explore their interests alongside their parents. They are able to express their ideas and creativity through imaginative and explorative play. Physical activity is encouraged through the provision of a range of outside play areas. Adults recognise and respond to children's development and interests, in an inclusive environment.</p><p>Babies and toddlers are included naturally in the programme. They benefit from warm, caring relationships with all adults. Mothers encourage their babies to play with a wide range of equipment appropriate to their age. They acknowledge and value the high levels of reciprocal support from one another, including the sharing of good food and nutrition practices.</p><p>Young children are highly engaged in both independent and group play. They select learning resources and make choices about what they want to do. Children demonstrate positive social skills and include other children in their play. These interactions build their confidence, independence, oral language and problem solving skills.</p><p>Adults prepare and present a wide range of high quality equipment and activities, which are available to all children. Parents are building their capability to recognise and respond to children's interests through course work and assistance from the playcentre support staff member. They record children's learning in portfolios. There are some good examples of learning stories that identify the way children learn, and possibilities to extend their learning. In addition, parents capture the uniqueness of each child's personality.</p><p>Children visit the neighbouring school and participate in various events. These strong connections are effectively supporting children's transition to school.</p><p>Parents have developed a strategic plan to guide ongoing development in the areas of property and sustainability. They review aspects of the playcentre's operation at monthly meetings. They now need to review the effectiveness of centre programmes in promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation and the King Country Playcentre Association continue to provide good quality governance and management for this centre. The association provides comprehensive policies and guidelines, and employs a centre support person who assists families to operate the service in the best interests of children and their parents and whānau. The benefits of this support would be made more evident if a process was introduced to provide formal reports on the quality of centre programmes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Self Review: It is important that parents, assisted by the centre support staff member, review the effectiveness of the quality of learning for babies, toddlers and children in their centre. Aspects for development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>documenting and analysing session evaluations over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving assessment practice to ensure that parents have a more consistent understanding of how best to notice, recognise and respond to children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This should improve the quality of learning interactions to sustain and extend children's emerging interests.</p><p>It is also important for parents to continue to develop their skills in te reo and tikanga Māori in order to integrate a programme of cultural awareness for themselves and their children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pukeatua Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pukeatua Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>9 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
