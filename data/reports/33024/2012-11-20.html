<a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2>
<h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3>
<p>Tamahere Playcentre is very well placed to promote and support outcomes for children.</p>
<h4>Context</h4>
<p>Tamahere Playcentre is located in a rural setting between Hamilton and Cambridge. It caters for children from birth to school-age. It operates three sessions per week with a fourth late afternoon whānau session on Fridays in Terms 1 and 4. There are high ratios of adults to children at each session. Centre members maintain close relationships with the adjacent primary school, which enables a smooth transition for children as new entrants at the school.</p>
<p>Since the 2009 ERO review, the centre’s membership has continued to grow and more parents are participating in playcentre education courses. This has led to further development of the centre’s self-review and planning processes. Further property developments have improved the environment for children and parents. In November 2010 the centre was registered under the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008.</p>
<p>The centre’s philosophy indicates that members value adults and children learning together through play in a safe, positive and stimulating environment. The New Zealand Playcentre Federation and the Waikato Playcentre Association (the association) provide effective governance and strategic direction. A knowledgeable and experienced centre support worker (CSW) is employed by the association to assist the centre with administration and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in six early childhood education services within the Waikato Playcentre Association umbrella organisation.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Tamahere Playcentre is run as a family cooperative by enthusiastic, capable and dedicated parents who have created a supportive community and a strong sense of belonging for children and adults. Parents take shared responsibility for the learning and care of all children in each session. Continuity of learning is supported by regularly reviewing and recording children’s changing and emerging interests. Effective teaching practices include:</p>
<ul><li>maintaining positive, sensitive and responsive relationships with children</li>
<li>modelling good questioning skills</li>
<li>playing alongside children to sustain engagement, particularly with dramatic play</li>
<li>fostering early knowledge of literacy and numeracy skills through conversations, learning stories, shared reading and writing experiences</li>
<li>ensuring that bilingual displays support families to develop their knowledge and understanding of te reo Māori . The centre philosophy is displayed alongside the historical meaning of the area’s name.</li>
</ul><p>Children and their families experience a welcoming, safe environment at the centre. The stimulating indoor and outdoor play areas include bilingual displays and other resources to support the development of te reo me ōna tikanga Māori. Younger children benefit from mixed-age sessions where older children are role models for safe, inclusive play and provide encouragement for them to try new things.</p>
<p>Parents provide a wide variety of interesting activities for children to explore. They also contribute rich perspectives to the design of the curriculum by using personal skills such as music to enhance learning for all. Children are able to develop their social skills and enjoy their learning through play in meaningful contexts. Observations of children’s participation and learning have clear links to <em>Te Whāriki,</em> [New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum]. These are recorded in individual profile books where next steps for learning are also indentified. <em>Te Whāriki</em> underpins the programme and its evaluation at each session. Parents appreciate the knowledge of the experienced supervisor who models good practice to parents at each session and demonstrates high levels of respect for children’s ideas.</p>
<p>Centre members take a shared approach to leadership within the centre. The individual skills of centre members are valued and used well to strengthen centre operations. More experienced members take responsibility for supporting newer members to facilitate centre sustainability. All members are encouraged and supported to participate in and complete playcentre training modules. Members have developed a useful framework for strategic planning that guides centre direction. Clear goals and actions are reviewed to monitor centre development and improvements. Formal and informal reviews of centre practices are regular and well informed.</p>
<p>Centre members and ERO agree that the centre’s next steps are to:</p>
<ul><li>continue to develop processes for extending children’s thinking and problem-solving skills.</li>
<li>make clearer links between children’s identified next steps for learning and subsequent profile entries to show progress and development</li>
<li>rationalise resources and displays to ensure children are able to maximise their use</li>
<li>access CSW reports as a tool for continuing review and development.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tamahere Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Next Review</h2>
<h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p>

<h4>About ERO Reviews</h4>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>Review focus</h3>
<p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p>
<p>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
<p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p>
