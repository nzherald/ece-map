<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p>Little World Early Childhood Centre, situated in Mt Albert, caters for up to 30 children under five years of age. <span>The centre has two separate but connected areas, one for children under two years old and one for toddlers and young children.</span> This is the centre&rsquo;s first ERO report since it was established in January 2010.</p>
<p><span>Children receive good quality education and care. They learn in an inclusive environment that provides them with a sense of security and belonging. Children use their well developed social skills to communicate with each other and with their teachers. They take an active role in their learning and collaborate well with others in their play.</span></p>
<p><span>The centre&rsquo;s teaching philosophy promotes children as creative and active learners and links well to practice. Teachers are committed to implementing teaching and learning practices advocated by professional learning and development initiatives. Reflective teaching practice has resulted in positive outcomes for children.</span></p>
<p>Teachers support children as socially competent and capable learners. <span>They provide relevant and varied resources to sustain children&rsquo;s interests. Staff members come from different cultural backgrounds, many of which reflect the children&rsquo;s own cultures and languages. As a result, children can often communicate with their teachers in their first language.</span></p>
<p><span>Parents report a high level of satisfaction with the education and care their children receive. Teachers regularly inform them about their children&rsquo;s progress through informal conversations, informative wall displays and individual children&rsquo;s assessment portfolios.</span></p>
<p><span>ERO and the centre managers agree that there are good self-review processes in place and to strengthen these, it is recommended that teachers and parents perspectives are included in centre self-review.</span></p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Little World Early Childhood Centre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atLittle World Early Childhood Centre.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate the quality of management systems.</p>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The owners, with the support and advice from an external ECE management group, have successfully modified a house and its outdoor environment to provide children with an appropriate learning environment. The openness of the indoor space enables teachers to modify areas of play to meet children&rsquo;s emerging interests and learning requirements.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>Programme planning and assessment. Staff have developed a shared understanding about how to implement effective early childhood education practice. Teachers&rsquo; skilled observations of children&rsquo;s learning form the basis for planning and assessment. Children&rsquo;s emerging interests are recognised and built upon. This is evident in children&rsquo;s individual assessment portfolios.</p>
<p>Cultural inclusiveness. The programme builds on children&rsquo;s cultural capability and families&rsquo; different experiences. This aspect of centre operations suits M&#257;ori families/wh&#257;nau well. While there are good examples of cultural inclusiveness and learning experiences, te reo M&#257;ori could be included more in the context of play. All children, including M&#257;ori children, benefit from teachers who respond and build upon individual children&rsquo;s experiences.</p>
<p>Learning environment. Children are settled and confident in their learning environment. A wide range of good quality resources provides children with opportunities to engage in a variety of experiences and areas of play. Children involve themselves in sustained play and share ideas and resources with each other.</p>
<p>The secure area for babies and toddlers allows for the youngest children in the centre to have their particular needs catered for. A safety glass barrier allows children from both areas to observe play.</p>
<p>Features of the centre&rsquo;s environment that are conducive to good learning include:</p>
<ul><li>well understood routines allowing children to lead their play</li>
<li>a well developed outdoor area providing children with physical challenge</li>
<li>easily accessed resources supporting children&rsquo;s independence and creativity</li>
<li>themes and displays that stimulate children&rsquo;s interest in the world around them.</li>
</ul><p>Interactions Teachers maintain warm and caring relationships with children and their families. Most of the interactions they have with children are reciprocal. Teachers respect children&rsquo;s independence and provide them with opportunities to develop. Children solve problems and think about ways they can resolve conflict.</p>
<p>Partnership with parents. Teachers have responded well to professional learning and development that is focused on recognising learning and informing parents how well their children are achieving and progressing. Parents, some with little English, feel respected and as a result are comfortable in the centre. Parents appreciate the way they are kept informed about their children&rsquo;s progress. They take the opportunity to provide centre management with in-depth feedback in their survey responses.</p>
<h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p>Literacy and mathematics. To further develop good literacy and mathematics practices, centre management plan to continue to include writing and mathematics in the programme and will support parents, by involving them in the programme and evening sessions, so they can gain a broader perspective of how children are exposed to literacy and numeracy throughout the programme.</p>
<p>Developing independence. Teachers view children as capable learners and follow children&rsquo;s lead in learning. Teachers could now consider how to ensure the management of centre routines better supports children&rsquo;s choice and self-help skills. For instance, the morning tea routine could be modified to provide children with more time for uninterrupted play.</p>
<p>Extending children&rsquo;s learning. There are some good examples of teachers responding to children&rsquo;s learning. These good practices could be developed further to ensure more consistent teacher practice. Teachers could:</p>
<p>identify more clearly how they will extend individual children&rsquo;s interests and strengths.</p>
<p>develop different ways to revisit learning with children and provide opportunities for children to use their portfolios in order to reflect on their learning successes.</p>
<h4>The Quality of Management</h4>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The owners of Little World Early Childhood Centre have maintained a business and professional relationship with their external support service since the centre&rsquo;s establishment in 2010. This ongoing relationship provides the owners with access to management systems and expertise in administration, personnel management and early childhood education.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>Communication. The licensee/owner and centre manager have ensured that communication in the centre is effective. Staff can express their opinions freely and ask for help in an open, supportive environment. As a result of this effective communication, a reflective teaching culture has emerged that focuses on improvement.</p>
<p>Staffing. Staff have a positive view of the management team and the direction the centre is taking. A stable staff means that parents and children benefit from getting to know individual staff members well. The development of the centre culture is strengthened by teachers who have a good knowledge of the centre's systems and work successfully as a team.</p>
<p>The owners acknowledge the importance of the development of well trained staff. Staff are supported well while in training and opportunities are provided for all staff to be involved in ongoing professional development</p>
<h3>Area for review and development</h3>
<p>Self review. Regular review visits by the external support service personnel help ensure that the centre is achieving its goals. Various self reviews of the learning environment have led to improved teaching and learning practices. To improve existing good practice, managers could consider including more staff and parent perspectives in centre reviews.</p>
<a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Little World Early Childhood Centre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendation</h2>
<p>ERO and the centre managers agree that centre management should further develop the centre&rsquo;s self-review practices to include parent and staff perspectives.</p>
<a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>

<p>To the Parents and Community of Little World Early Childhood Centre</p>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Little World Early Childhood Centre.</p>
<p>Little World Early Childhood Centre, situated in Mt Albert, caters for up to 30 children under five years of age. <span>The centre has two separate but connected areas, one for children under two years old and one for toddlers and young children.</span> This is the centre&rsquo;s first ERO report since it was established in January 2010.</p>
<p><span>Children receive good quality education and care. They learn in an inclusive environment that provides them with a sense of security and belonging. Children use their well developed social skills to communicate with each other and with their teachers. They take an active role in their learning and collaborate well with others in their play.</span></p>
<p><span>The centre&rsquo;s teaching philosophy promotes children as creative and active learners and links well to practice. Teachers are committed to implementing teaching and learning practices advocated by professional learning and development initiatives. Reflective teaching practice has resulted in positive outcomes for children.</span></p>
<p>Teachers support children as socially competent and capable learners. <span>They provide relevant and varied resources to sustain children&rsquo;s interests. Staff members come from different cultural backgrounds, many of which reflect the children&rsquo;s own cultures and languages. As a result, children can often communicate with their teachers in their first language.</span></p>
<p><span>Parents report a high level of satisfaction with the education and care their children receive. Teachers regularly inform them about their children&rsquo;s progress through informal conversations, informative wall displays and individual children&rsquo;s assessment portfolios.</span></p>
<p><span>ERO and the centre managers agree that there are good self-review processes in place and to strengthen these, it is recommended that teachers and parents perspectives are included in centre self-review.</span></p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p>
<p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
