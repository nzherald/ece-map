</table><p>Meadowbank Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Meadowbank Kindergarten is licensed for 40 children over two years of age. It operates from 8.30 am to 2.30 pm. The centre is multicultural with small numbers of Māori children. The philosophy prioritises <span lang="mi">whanaungatanga</span> and values play-based learning. It emphasises resilience, independence, self-regulation, problem solving and a can-do attitude. The philosophy includes a commitment to bicultural practices and to developing a sustainable kindergarten.</p><p>The teaching team consists of four registered teachers including the head teacher. They are supported by a teacher aide and an administrator. A parent committee/whānau support group is responsible for fundraising initiatives and represents the kindergarten on the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA) board. Teachers promote the concept of the 'kindergarten community'.</p><p>In 2015, ERO identified positive aspects such as an attractive, well-resourced environment to provoke and sustain child-initiated learning, discovery and purposeful play. These continue to be present. Key next steps included strengthening evaluative self review and making children's thinking and learning more evident in documentation. Some progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Association (AKA), which provides leadership, a framework of policies and operational guidelines, support personnel and programmes of professional learning and development. A revised operation manual has recently been introduced by AKA.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven AKA kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well supported to try things out, learn and discover. They demonstrate a sense of ownership and belonging in the kindergarten and are supportive and caring towards others. Children play cooperatively, make decisions and confidently share ideas. Their growing understanding of literacy and mathematics, science and use of technologies is fostered through authentic learning opportunities. Children have fun and their creativity is nurtured though sensitive teacher support and an extensive variety of art and music experiences.</p><p>Children learn in a stimulating and vibrant learning environment that reflects their interest and life experiences and sustains their engagement in play. The outside area provides good opportunities for physical challenge and encourages children to care for natural resources. The environment is print rich and displays show how teachers value the multicultural backgrounds of attending families.</p><p>Teacher<em>s</em> are inclusive and value children as being competent and confident learners. Teachers affirm and build on what children already know. Their skilful interactions extend children’s ideas, language and knowledge in sustained play and discussion. They encourage children to be responsible and have leadership opportunities. Teachers continuously look for additional ways to support children's social and emotional wellbeing.</p><p>Teachers provide a child-led programme that is based on <em><span lang="mi">Te Whāriki</span>,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and bicultural practices. They promote environmental sustainability and nurture children's interests, dispositions and abilities. A new system of planning documentation makes visible children's learning through play and reflects parent aspirations. Children’s learning records, including online e-portfolios, are highly valued and frequently added to by families. The portfolios show a curriculum that is responsive to individual and group interests.</p><p>Teachers have a strong commitment to <span lang="mi">Te Tiriti o Waitangi</span> and to acknowledging the place of Māori as tangata whenua. Teachers affirm Māori children's cultural identity and make connections through <span lang="mi">whakapapa</span>. They are building their own and children’s familiarity with <span lang="mi">te reo</span> and <span lang="mi">tikanga Māori</span>. Teachers value children's cultural heritage and knowledge and encourage their use of home languages.</p><p><span lang="mi">Whanaungatanga</span> in the kindergarten is underpinned by respectful and responsive relationships between teachers, children and their whānau. Teachers foster a welcoming and inclusive tone in the kindergarten. Parent/whānau partnerships in their children's learning is encouraged. Children’s transition into the kindergarten and to school is well supported and responsive to individual children and whānau needs.</p><p>AKA continues to provide support for kindergartens to strengthen bicultural practices. Specialist support impacts positively on teachers’ confidence and on the inclusion of children with additional learning needs. AKA is currently considering ways to strengthen the role of Parent Whānau Groups in all kindergartens. The strategic direction established by AKA leaders is providing a positive framework for kindergartens’ annual planning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers agree that next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment and planning documentation that makes the depth and continuity in children's learning more visible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>re-establishing documented internal evaluation that focuses on the effectiveness of kindergarten processes and practices on improving outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>AKA leaders agree that their next steps are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>quality assurance by monitoring that the individual kindergarten's procedures, and the recording of aspects related to children's health and safety, align with AKA policies and meet licensing requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation at all levels of the AKA.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Meadowbank Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>8 May 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
