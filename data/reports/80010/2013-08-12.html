</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Family Ties Educare at Musselburgh is one of three privately owned Family Ties centres. A new management team took over the business from April 2013. Most of the staff are qualified teachers.</p><p>The centre is licensed for up to 25 children but the owner wants to maintain a family-like atmosphere with no more than 20 children. Similarly, there is a low child to adult ratio.</p><p>Teachers provide full-day care and education for children from approximately three-to-five years. Most children come from the nearby Family Ties centre for children under three years.</p><p>Teachers have made some progress in addressing the recommendations in ERO’s 2009 report. The new owner recognises that some of the recommendations require ongoing work. This includes further developing self-review and appraisal practices.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three reviews in the Family Ties Educare reviews.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn and play in a family-like environment. They confidently approach their teachers and settle quickly into prepared activities on arrival. Teachers take time to talk with parents about their children and provide useful support to them.</p><p>Teachers have caring and respectful relationships with the children and know the children well. They show a genuine interest in children’s lives beyond the centre and make links between this and children’s learning at the centre.</p><p>Children are encouraged to be independent and take responsibility. Teachers focus on social skills, including good manners and showing consideration for other children’s feelings. Centre routines are well established. The children know these and the teachers’ expectations well.</p><p>There is an intentional focus on preparation for school, including introducing children to a structured programme. Children benefit from a wide range of interesting early literacy and mathematics learning experiences. This includes developing a love of books and knowledge of sounds and letters.</p><p>Teachers carefully plan group topics, with specific learning outcomes and experiences. For example, children spent several weeks learning about what is unique to New Zealand. Children often enjoy waiata and hear and use some basic te reo Maori.</p><p>Children’s individual profile books provide an attractive record of their experiences at the centre. These show links to the early childhood curriculum and some analysis of the child’s learning.</p><p>Children play and learn in a well-resourced, well-organised and attractive environment. Children can see their pictures and learning displays, often with their captions, throughout the centre.</p><p>The new management team is presently developing useful guidelines and expectations for teachers in the three Family Ties centres. The teachers feel very well supported by the new managers. They value their ongoing professional conversations and learning. They also communicate well with each other about the children in their care.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps are to better:</p><ul>
<li>record how teachers plan to extend individual children’s learning</li>
<li>show what difference their teaching strategies have made for that child</li>
<li>show how they gather and respond to parents’ wishes for their children’s learning.</li>
</ul><p>They should also make children’s profiles more accessible for children and their parents.</p><p>The new management team and ERO have identified that the next steps for the Family Ties Educare organisation are to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop planning to guide the centre’s direction</li>
<li>deepen teachers’ and managers’ understanding of effective self review</li>
<li>use self review to monitor the effectiveness of all aspects of the operation of the service over time</li>
<li>complete the development of policies, procedures and guidelines related to curriculum implementation and human resource management in preparation for relicensing under the 2008 Early Childhood Regulations and Licensing Criteria</li>
<li>improve and formalise support for provisionally-registered teachers</li>
<li>further develop and implement a rigorous appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Family Ties Educare (2) completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Family Ties Educare (2) will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>12 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
