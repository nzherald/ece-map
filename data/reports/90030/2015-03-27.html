</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Frankton Playcentre is one of 33 play centres within the Otago Playcentre Association (OPA). It is located beside the local school. The playcentre is managed by a parent council. Some parents are involved in playcentre training to improve their understanding of how children learn. The parent council employs a trained educator to lead sessions along with an education team and parent help.</p><p>The playcentre provides morning sessions for children from birth to school age and an afternoon session one day a week.</p><p>The playcentre has been through a period of major regrowth in 2014. This has included:</p><ul>
<li>changes on education team and parent council</li>
<li>a greater focus on learning</li>
<li>rapid roll growth, including families from increasingly diverse ethnic backgrounds</li>
<li>having its full licence reinstated.</li>
</ul><p>The playcentre’s philosophy emphasises children learning through play and having a sense of belonging. It promotes parents learning alongside their children. The parents believe great learning comes from mixed-age sessions.</p><p>The 2011 ERO report identified the need to extend self-review practices. This continues to be an area for development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre’s philosophy is evident in practice. Children enjoy a range of interesting learning experiences within a well resourced centre. These experiences include literacy, sensory, dramatic and imaginative play. Over recent months the education team has made increased use of the local environment to build on children’s interests, such as a variety of forms of transportation. Through play children can explore and are exposed to a range of mathematical concepts that include sorting, counting, measuring, problem solving and geometry.</p><p>Relationships within the centre are welcoming, warm and supportive of children and their whānau. Parents and children show a strong sense of belonging to the centre. ERO observed positive relationships between adults with children. Children play alongside each other well.</p><p>Adults foster children’s self-management skills. Children have easy access to the equipment and resources. They make choices of activities to follow their interests. Educators and parents have an awareness of the children’s interests and support these.</p><p>The centre provides a safe environment for infants and toddlers to explore and extend their learning. Safe spaces are provided for children who are not yet mobile.</p><p>Educators and parents have focused on building their knowledge and skills in assessing and recording children’s learning. The children’s individual profiles:</p><ul>
<li>capture examples of their learning and play</li>
<li>record children’s voice effectively</li>
<li>are contributed to by different educators and parents.</li>
</ul><p>The education team meets formally and informally to discuss the playcentre’s programme. Records show intentions of identifying goals for individual children and to gather the aspirations parents have for their children. The centre has a useful procedure for supporting and documenting children’s learning. The educators acknowledge that their next step is to plan children’s learning pathways more deliberately.</p><p>Adults interact positively with children in a positive manner to support them to make choices and be independent. Improved planning should help educators and parents focus their interactions with children to make them more purposeful.</p><p>The playcentre has a culture of improvement and growth. This is supported by:</p><ul>
<li>all parents having opportunities to contribute their thoughts and ideas</li>
<li>many examples of spontaneous reviews being carried out to improve outcomes for children</li>
<li>the parent council following its schedule for reviewing centre procedures.</li>
</ul><p>The education team has identified the need to focus more on recognising their bi-cultural practice within the curriculum. ERO agrees and sees this as a worthwhile step to base future developments in this area.</p><h3>Governance</h3><p>The Otago Playcentre Association (OPA) is facing challenges and uncertainty as the Playcentre Federation undergoes a significant period of restructuring. The OPA is waiting for the federation strategic plan to guide next steps in governance and management. In recent times there have been a number of key personnel changes (both paid and unpaid) within the OPA. The parent council has received valuable support and guidance from the OPA as it worked to have its full licence reinstated. At the time of the review a new centre advisor had been appointed to support the playcentre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The educators and parents need to continue to strengthen the planning processes for individual children and groups of children. In particular, they should more clearly identify learning outcomes in response to parents’ wishes and information gathered in learning stories.</p><p>The educators and the parent council need to work with the centre advisor to develop a deeper understanding of self review to ensure that programmes are reviewed. They should use self review to monitor the effectiveness of their curriculum, programmes and practices, including the philosophy and mathematics learning area.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Frankton Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Frankton Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer-Southern Southern Region</p><p>27 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
