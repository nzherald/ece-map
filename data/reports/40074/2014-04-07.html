</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>St Peters Childcare Centre is situated near the central business district in Tauranga and is licensed to provide all day education and care for 50 preschool children, including up to 15 under two years old. Fifteen of the 63 children enrolled at the centre identify as Māori, and 11 are from cultural backgrounds other than New Zealand European. The centre is governed by a trust, comprised of elders and members from St Peter's Church and is able to use adjacent church facilities when needed. Families benefit from ready access to counselling and care services available through the church.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO and responded constructively to recommendations from the 2011 ERO report. The centre manager, head teacher and a number of teachers have remained at the centre since that review. They have engaged in self review and professional development opportunities, which have contributed to continual improvements in shared leadership, assessment, teaching and the promotion of success for Māori children. There is a high proportion of qualified staff.</p><p>The centre's indoor area is divided into two play spaces; the explorers' room, which caters for infants and toddlers, and the discoverers' room, which has equipment and resources to promote learning for older children. The outdoor area is readily accessed by children from both rooms. There is free flow play between indoor spaces to accommodate children's preferences for interactions between age groups.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is to provide Christian-based care and education based on children's interests and facilitated through positive respectful relationships. Collaboration, kindness, shared leadership, whanaungatanga and community are Christian values that are woven throughout the interactions with children and their families. Creativity and humour are also valued. The philosophy is reflected in practices throughout the centre. A calm, family-like environment is provided for infants, toddlers and young children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from high-quality responsive and respectful interactions with teachers who naturally integrate Christian values and beliefs within the programme. Children are encouraged to take the lead in their learning journeys. Teachers participate actively in children's play, developing their language skills and sustaining engagement in their activities of choice. Conversations include problem solving, extending children's interests and promoting friendships. Te reo Māori is increasingly incorporated into routines and discussions. Transitions into and from the centre are sensitively managed according to the requirements of individual children and their families.</p><p>Teachers plan collaboratively to extend the children's emerging interests. They effectively use every-day contexts such as gardening, cooking and construction to ensure that learning is meaningful and enjoyable. Opportunities to develop literacy, mathematics, science, music and creative skills are effectively woven into the programme. Well-considered wall displays celebrate children's achievements and make learning visible to children, parents and teachers. Children are confident and competent learners.</p><p>Well presented individual profiles record assessments of children's learning that include references to Te Whatu Pokeka (Māori assessment for learning), and increasingly demonstrate progress over time. Profile entries are also shared online with parents. This enhances the seamlessness of the home-centre partnership by enabling parents and whānau to immediately comment on children's new learning and development. Profiles indicate that older children are effectively encouraged to sustain and develop interests and learning over time.</p><p>High-quality learning environments are thoughtfully considered and attractively presented making the centre welcoming for children and parents. Māori perspectives are represented by photographs of children's marae, an iwi map showing where the marae are located, a whānau wall, children's depiction of a local Māori legend, and bilingual signage. This represents the centre's emphasis on supporting children's culture, language and identity. Resources, including natural materials, are readily accessible. The shared outdoor area maximises opportunities for physical challenge, social play and exploration of the living world.</p><p>Education and care for infants and toddlers is warm and nurturing, and reflects the centre's emphasis on the importance of attachment between adults and very young children. A kaiako hei tiaki (care teacher) is designated for each child to support secure attachments with teachers. A high teacher/child ratio and a full-time teaching team contribute to consistent care. Children's individuality and routines are respected and responded to with sensitivity. They have many opportunities to continue growing as confident communicators and explorers. Parents have daily opportunities to discuss any matters relating to their children.</p><p>The centre manager is an experienced, knowledgeable and highly effective professional leader. She has strong professional networks and makes good use of current theory and recognised best practice in early childhood education to sustain, review and improve centre practices. Shared leadership among all teaching staff is encouraging teachers to take responsibility for centre tasks and programme decision making. The centre manager and teachers are critically reflective of their teaching and centre pratices. Appraisal processes are evidence-based and ensure regular monitoring of teachers' goals and practices. Extensive self review is focused on continually improving positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Governance effectively ensures that the centre is well managed. Four long-standing trustees bring a range of relevant expertise to their responsibilities. Strategic direction is developed by centre leaders and trustees in response to comprehensive self review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Trustees, centre manager and staff have identified that next steps are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>increase centre-wide use of te reo Māori and the exploration of local stories</li>
<li>develop the use of computer technology as a tool for learning</li>
<li>further incorporate children's perspectives in assessment and planning.</li>
</ul><p>ERO agrees with these and other identified future directions. ERO has also identified that further refining self-review records should enable trustees, management and staff to more easily monitor the impact of changes in relation to positive outcomes for children and families.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of St Peters Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of St Peters Childcare Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>7 April 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
