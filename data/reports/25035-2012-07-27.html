<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>The Tree House complex, consisting of two early childhood education centres, is located in a bush setting in spacious grounds alongside Middlemore Hospital. Most of the families with children at the centres are part of the hospital staff community. They elect representatives onto a governance committee, which employs a professional management service to oversee the day-to-day management of the centres. Parents/wh&#257;nau appreciate the centre&rsquo;s stability, community and history. Children demonstrate a secure sense of belonging and wellbeing. There are good systems to support continuity as children move through the five rooms in The Tree House complex.</p><p>This report focuses on the Over 3&rsquo;s centre&rsquo;s programmes in the Totara and Kauri rooms, which provide for up to 40 children over the age of three years. Teaching teams work together to provide calm and aesthetically pleasing environments that prompt children to revisit prior learning, investigate and develop their own ideas. The deck and outdoor play areas are very well used. The environments are richly resourced and there is a busy atmosphere of engagement in varied and interesting learning activities.</p><p>Programmes are underpinned by the principles and strands of Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers are responsive to children&rsquo;s emerging interests. They work closely with children to involve them in thinking about next learning steps and to develop project investigations over time. Teachers&rsquo; current professional development focuses on further strategies for deepening children&rsquo;s learning. More visible records of teachers&rsquo; planning and clearer links between planning and individual children&rsquo;s assessment may support this development.</p><p>Bicultural practice is well integrated in programmes for children. Staff continue to look for ways to strengthen their partnership with wh&#257;nau and to make community cultures more visible in the environment. The centre could now strengthen processes for consultation with its M&#257;ori community.</p><p>Self- review processes are well established. The governance committee has established key strategic goals for ongoing centre development and provides very good support for teachers to engage in professional development. The committee is well placed to continue supporting managers and staff in sustaining and building on existing good practices in the centre.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of The Tree House - Over 3's was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atThe Tree House - Over 3's.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The Totara and Kauri rooms cater for three and four-year-old children and share a large outdoor play space that slopes down to a substantial bush area. The centre supervisor is a fully registered teacher and three other teachers are working towards full registration. A further four staff are currently studying towards teaching qualifications.</p><p>Developments since ERO&rsquo;s 2009 review have focused on transforming the environment to better support children&rsquo;s learning, building teacher confidence in using te reo M&#257;ori, and establishing &lsquo;inquiry learning&rsquo; approaches. Teachers have also worked to strengthen their programme documentation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><em>Philosophy in practice.</em> The centre&rsquo;s philosophy emphasises the role of the environment in fostering learning, and the importance of respectful relationships with wh&#257;nau and children within a calm, unhurried atmosphere. Teachers value documentation as a tool for supporting holistic learning, and view children as capable contributors to programme development. These factors are clearly evident in practice and contribute to the good quality of relationships and programmes in the centre.</p><p><em>Community and relationships.</em> Teachers work flexibly as a team and establish supportive, trusting and professional relationships with families and children. Parents appreciate longstanding relationships with staff and the sense of stability and community. The centre has also established strong connections with its surrounding neighbours, including the hospital and local secondary schools.</p><p><em>Learning environments.</em> The physical setting, rich resourcing, careful attention to detail and innovative presentation are highlights throughout the centre. Other features include:</p><ul>
<li>high quality furniture and inviting, vibrant play areas with carefully considered displays that provoke investigation and extended thinking</li>
<li>thoughtful and creative use of natural materials</li>
<li>good use of decks and the whole outdoor area to extend indoor activities and offer physical challenge and variety.</li>
</ul><p><em>Bicultural practice.</em> Teachers use te reo M&#257;ori regularly throughout the day. Children are familiar with te reo and readily lead karakia. The environment reflects teachers&rsquo; commitment to valuing the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p><p><em>Integrated curriculum.</em> Teachers provide high quality support for children&rsquo;s oral, written and visual literacy development. Science and mathematical language and concepts are naturally and purposefully included in meaningful interactions and projects. Children&rsquo;s creativity is nurtured, and visiting music, drama and sports specialists contribute to the centre&rsquo;s diverse community.</p><p><em>Responsive programmes.</em> Teachers are continually alert for and engage in discussion with children about their ideas, and about their activities and investigations. Children&rsquo;s ideas are recorded and used by teachers to plan strategies for extending learning. Children frequently revisit display books that record previous projects and that are attractively presented to prompt further thinking.</p><p><em>Capable learners.</em> Children are capable communicators and decision makers, and active participants in extensive one-to-one and group discussions. They confidently take leadership roles and work collaboratively with adults and each other. They know their contributions are valued and demonstrate a growing sense of themselves as independent learners.</p><p><em>Self review.</em> Self-review processes are well established and continue to evolve. Teachers document programme activities and children&rsquo;s learning in a variety of ways and use current theories and research to review aspects of their programmes. Their ongoing reflection on programmes helps them to refine their practice. Regular management and staff meetings contribute to continuity and consistency in the centre. Management and teaching reports to the governance committee keep the committee informed about centre operations.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>Managers and teachers agree that provision for children could be enhanced by:</p><ul>
<li>more accessible documentation of teachers&rsquo; thinking and planning in response to what they notice and record about children&rsquo;s emerging interests and ideas</li>
<li>clearer links between individual assessment, programme planning, and teachers&rsquo; reflections about programmes and outcomes for children</li>
<li>greater use of information and communication technologies to support children&rsquo;s research and learning</li>
<li>more explicit documentation of partnerships with parents/wh&#257;nau in policies, assessment records, self review and planning</li>
<li>increasing the integration of cultural diversity in assessment, environments and programmes throughout the year</li>
<li>specific consultation with M&#257;ori families and kaum&#257;tua about bicultural policies and practices.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are currently exploring ways to deepen children&rsquo;s learning. More in-depth, critical inquiry into their role as teachers could help them to achieve this aim. They could make better use of the centre&rsquo;s philosophy and curriculum statements and of indicators of best practice in early childhood education, to review their practice.</p><p>Managers could consider reporting to the committee against the centre&rsquo;s curriculum priorities and the 2008 licensing criteria. This reporting would help the committee to be assured that they are meeting current legal requirements. More specific reporting would also enable the committee and managers to monitor progress towards the centre&rsquo;s strategic goals.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of The Tree House - Over 3's completed an ERO <em>Centre Assurance Statement </em>and&nbsp;<em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendations</h2><p>ERO and the centre managers agree that:</p><ol>
<li>teachers should continue whole-centre professional development to strengthen critical evaluation processes and deepen children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>the committee and managers should formalise consultative, partnership relationships with the centre&rsquo;s M&#257;ori community.</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-the-tree-house-over-3s" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of The Tree House - Over 3's</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on The Tree House - Over 3's.</p><p>The Tree House complex, consisting of two early childhood education centres, is located in a bush setting in spacious grounds alongside Middlemore Hospital. Most of the families with children at the centres are part of the hospital staff community. They elect representatives onto a governance committee, which employs a professional management service to oversee the day-to-day management of the centres. Parents/wh&#257;nau appreciate the centre&rsquo;s stability, community and history. Children demonstrate a secure sense of belonging and wellbeing. There are good systems to support continuity as children move through the five rooms in The Tree House complex.</p><p>This report focuses on the Over 3&rsquo;s centre&rsquo;s programmes in the Totara and Kauri rooms, which provide for up to 40 children over the age of three years. Teaching teams work together to provide calm and aesthetically pleasing environments that prompt children to revisit prior learning, investigate and develop their own ideas. The deck and outdoor play areas are very well used. The environments are richly resourced and there is a busy atmosphere of engagement in varied and interesting learning activities.</p><p>Programmes are underpinned by the principles and strands of Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers are responsive to children&rsquo;s emerging interests. They work closely with children to involve them in thinking about next learning steps and to develop project investigations over time. Teachers&rsquo; current professional development focuses on further strategies for deepening children&rsquo;s learning. More visible records of teachers&rsquo; planning and clearer links between planning and individual children&rsquo;s assessment may support this development.</p><p>Bicultural practice is well integrated in programmes for children. Staff continue to look for ways to strengthen their partnership with wh&#257;nau and to make community cultures more visible in the environment. The centre could now strengthen processes for consultation with its M&#257;ori community.</p><p>Self- review processes are well established. The governance committee has established key strategic goals for ongoing centre development and provides very good support for teachers to engage in professional development. The committee is well placed to continue supporting managers and staff in sustaining and building on existing good practices in the centre.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
