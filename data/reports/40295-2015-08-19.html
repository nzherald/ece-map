</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Sandbox Preschool is located in Papamoa, near Tauranga. The centre is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 50 children, including up to 8 children from birth to two years of age. At the time of this ERO review, there were 52 children enrolled, including 14 children who identify as Māori.</p><p>The centre philosophy acknowledges Te Tiriti o Waitangi and aims for teachers to form partnerships with whānau to build foundations for children’s lifelong learning. They are committed to ‘providing a nurturing, supportive and respectful environment where children and their teachers intimately know, respond and understand each other’s cues and rhythms’.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review, there has been a change of ownership. The centre is currently owned by Evolve Education Group. The under 2's area was reopened two years ago. While the centre has endeavoured to make changes to their appraisal processes, further review and development is required.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle quickly into a welcoming and well-prepared learning environment. They form positive, sensitive and responsive relationships with teachers and their peers. Children’s social and communication skills are fostered and, as a result, they are confident to interact with adults and their peers, supporting a strong sense of belonging. They demonstrate confidence, independence and problem-solving skills. They experience a range of opportunities for exploration and safe risk taking, and respond positively to social, physical and emotional challenges. Children experience early literacy and numeracy skills across all areas of the programme throughout their time at the centre.</p><p>Babies and toddlers enjoy and have fun in their learning. They experience a high level of nurturing, education and care. Teachers have regular contact with parents in order to provide familiar and comfortable routines consistent with their home environment. Babies benefit from a calm and flexible curriculum that offers choice and a sense of security. Teachers respond well to their oral and non-verbal communication. They model and encourage development of rich oral language skills. Children also have access to a range of resources and equipment that support their changing needs and preferences. It would be beneficial to upgrade these provisions and the learning spaces, to better provide children with opportunities for physically active and exploratory play.</p><p>The centre programme provides children with choices about their learning. Teachers are responsive to children’s interests and encourage their independence. They know children well and communicate regularly with parents about their learning and development. They seek parents’ aspirations and give feedback about how these are being nurtured and achieved. Bicultural practice is increasingly included in the centre programmes through displays, waiata, books and some te reo Māori. Leaders recognise the importance of continuing to develop teachers’ skills and the consistency of practice across the centre.</p><p>Children’s individual portfolios provide a rich and meaningful record of their participation and learning. Teachers reflect on children’s learning stories and plan their teaching to support the growth of learning dispositions. Teachers’ planning could be further developed by evaluating how well children’s learning has been extended and made more complex.</p><p>The experienced and knowledgeable centre leaders support a cohesive team of staff who share a common philosophy. Leadership is shared in order to use the strengths and interests of teachers. Professional development in literacy has impacted positively on teachers’ knowledge, the centre programme, and information for parents. Staff are involved in spontaneous self reviews aimed at improving centre practices and outcomes for children. There is a need for more attention to be given to planned, long-term self reviews.</p><p>The new owners are committed to maintaining good practice in the centre and providing appropriate professional development and support for centre leaders and staff. They are also available to provide guidance and advice about centre operations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>There is a need for leaders to review and strengthen self-review processes in order to more effectively evaluate teaching practice and continually improve outcomes for children. This would better enable them to review:</p><ul>
<li>progress towards achieving the centre vision, goals and outcomes, and inform the development of priorities, plans, policies and actions</li>
<li>staff appraisal processes, which should include reflection and monitoring, links to the centre vision, professional teaching standards, and specific teachers’ goals focused on improving outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Sandbox Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Sandbox Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>19 August 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
