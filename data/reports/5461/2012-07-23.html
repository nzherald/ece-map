<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Vickery Street in Kaiapoi is open from 8.30 am and 2.30 pm on week days and has up to 30 children over the age of two years at any one time. It is licensed to take up to 40 children.</p><p>All teachers at the kindergarten are fully registered and early childhood trained and have worked together as a team for some time.</p><p>This Kindergarten is one of 62 kindergartens administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens. An association Educational Support Manager (ESM) provides support for the kindergarten.</p><p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates a management layer in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who works in partnership with teachers providing ongoing educational leadership and professional development.</p><p>This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes. They have been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><p>This kindergarten hosted another local kindergarten for several terms following damage to its facilities. The impact of the earthquakes has included a reduction in the centre&rsquo;s roll as families have moved from the district.</p><p>This kindergarten provides children with a suitably varied range of opportunities to engage in both indoor and outdoor play.</p><p>Strengths of the kindergarten include the:</p><ul>
<li>learning environment created for children</li>
<li>relationships between adults and children</li>
<li>emphasis placed on children&rsquo;s social and physical development</li>
<li>integration of aspects of literacy, numeracy, biculturalism and technology into the programme</li>
<li>way children display some of the attitudes and skills they need to become capable, confident life-long learners.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers work well as a team. They foster positive working relationships with parents. Teachers show a willingness to improve the quality of education and care they provide for children.</p><p>The head teacher and teachers recognise that the next steps for them include:</p><ul>
<li>being clearer about what counts as high quality teaching and learning</li>
<li>extending the range of teaching practices they use to promote children&rsquo;s learning and development</li>
<li>improving aspects of programme planning and evaluation, assessment and self-review.</li>
</ul><p>As noted by ERO and association staff, targeted professional development and support will be critical to fostering these improvements.</p><p>ERO has identified in this review, and also in the November 2007 ERO report, the need to improve the quality of teaching and learning. ERO requests an action plan to show how the recommendations in this report will be addressed.</p><p>Since the onsite stage of the review the teachers and the kindergarten association have submitted a detailed action plan of how the association will address the issues identified in this report.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Vickery Street was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergartens Vickery Street.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The teachers have all worked at the kindergarten for some time. Since the last review they have continued to refine some aspects of their programme and practices and have also improved the kindergarten&rsquo;s physical environment.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><strong>Learning opportunities</strong></p><p>Teachers provide children with a suitably varied range of opportunities to engage in both indoor and outdoor play. The programme has a mixture of child and teacher initiated activities.</p><p>Features of the programme include the successful integration of aspects of literacy, numeracy, biculturalism and information and communication technologies (ICT). Teachers also give appropriate emphasis to promoting children&rsquo;s social and physical development. ERO observed children happily engaged in a wide variety of self-selected exploratory play.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s attractively presented profiles include an interesting range of information about the activities they take part in. Learning stories include useful comments about aspects of children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers offer parents the opportunity for interviews to discuss the information in profiles and their children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p><strong>Relationships</strong></p><p>A strength of the kindergarten is the quality of relationships between teachers and children. ERO observed friendly, respectful, affirming and supportive interactions between teachers and children. Children were well behaved and confident. These relationships support children to take risks and foster their sense of well-being and belonging.</p><p>ERO saw teachers interacting positively with parents and working in ways that were supportive of them and their families.</p><p><strong>Environment</strong></p><p>Teachers provide children with a supportive and calm learning environment. They are responsive to children&rsquo;s immediate needs and have well established routines.</p><p>Ongoing improvements are being made to the kindergarten&rsquo;s physical environment in an effort to further promote children&rsquo;s learning and development. There is a good range of both indoor and outdoor activities. Wall displays help to celebrate children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Teachers should now consider increasing the range of resources children can readily access to support their exploratory play and learning.</p><p><strong>Teamwork</strong></p><p>Teachers work well as a team, support one another and are responsive to children&rsquo;s immediate needs and concerns. They show a willingness to make ongoing improvements to the quality of education and care they provide for children.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p><strong>Extending children&rsquo;s learning</strong></p><p>Teachers, as noted in the November 2007 ERO report, still need to extend the range of strategies they use to promote children&rsquo;s development as capable and competent learners. For instance, they should consider how best to:</p><ul>
<li>move towards using a greater range of child-centred teaching approaches</li>
<li>extend their questioning skills in ways that help to further promote children&rsquo;s thinking and problem solving skills</li>
<li>build on the capacity children display to become increasingly independent learners.</li>
</ul><p>Continuity in professional development and support will be critical to helping teachers realise their commitment to ongoing improvement. Recent developments within the Association should help this to occur.</p><p><strong>Improving planning, assessment and evaluation</strong></p><p>ERO agrees with the ESM, head teacher and teachers that further improvements are needed in the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>programme planning so this provides a better basis for fostering children&rsquo;s learning and development</li>
<li>assessment practices so that the information arising from these can be better used to respond to children&rsquo;s strengths, interests and needs</li>
<li>programme evaluation so that this supports ongoing improvements to the quality of teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Professional development and self review</strong></p><p>There is now a need for teachers&rsquo; professional development and support to clarify their vision for the kindergarten and establish a clearer set of shared beliefs and expectations about what counts as high quality teaching and learning.</p><p>To support developments and inform future decision making, the kindergarten&rsquo;s self review programme and appraisal processes should place greater focus on evaluating and improving the quality of teaching and learning.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Vickery Street completed an ERO CentreManagementAssurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the kindergarten&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-vickery-street" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Vickery Street</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kidsfirst Kindergartens Vickery Street.</p><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Vickery Street in Kaiapoi is open from 8.30 am and 2.30 pm on week days and has up to 30 children over the age of two years at any one time. It is licensed to take up to 40 children.</p><p>All teachers at the kindergarten are fully registered and early childhood trained and have worked together as a team for some time.</p><p>This Kindergarten is one of 62 kindergartens administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens. An association Educational Support Manager (ESM) provides support for the kindergarten.</p><p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates a management layer in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who works in partnership with teachers providing ongoing educational leadership and professional development.</p><p>This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes. They have been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><p>This kindergarten hosted another local kindergarten for several terms following damage to its facilities. The impact of the earthquakes has included a reduction in the centre&rsquo;s roll as families have moved from the district.</p><p>This kindergarten provides children with a suitably varied range of opportunities to engage in both indoor and outdoor play.</p><p>Strengths of the kindergarten include the:</p><ul>
<li>learning environment created for children</li>
<li>relationships between adults and children</li>
<li>emphasis placed on children&rsquo;s social and physical development</li>
<li>integration of aspects of literacy, numeracy, biculturalism and technology into the programme</li>
<li>way children display some of the attitudes and skills they need to become capable, confident life-long learners.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers work well as a team. They foster positive working relationships with parents. Teachers show a willingness to improve the quality of education and care they provide for children.</p><p>The head teacher and teachers recognise that the next steps for them include:</p><ul>
<li>being clearer about what counts as high quality teaching and learning</li>
<li>extending the range of teaching practices they use to promote children&rsquo;s learning and development</li>
<li>improving aspects of programme planning and evaluation, assessment and self-review.</li>
</ul><p>As noted by ERO and association staff, targeted professional development and support will be critical to fostering these improvements.</p><p>ERO has identified in this review, and also in the November 2007 ERO report, the need to improve the quality of teaching and learning. ERO requests an action plan to show how the recommendations in this report will be addressed.</p><p>Since the onsite stage of the review the teachers and the kindergarten association have submitted a detailed action plan of how the association will address the issues identified in this report.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information About Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
