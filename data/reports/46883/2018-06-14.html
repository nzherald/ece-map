</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wonder Home-Based ECE is one of six Home-Based education and care networks owned by the service provider. It provides for up to 80 children from infancy to school age. Educators provide programmes in their homes for up to four children at a time. Most of the children are Tongan. This is the first ERO review of the service that was established in 2016.</p><p>Wonder Home-Based ECE is led by experienced and registered early childhood teachers. A supervisor works closely with the coordinator to support educators to plan educational programmes based on children's interests, and to monitor health and safety requirements. Key aspects of the service's philosophy are to provide a culturally responsive curriculum based on the Tongan concept of vā, respectful relationships and connectedness, and to maintain Tongan language and culture.</p><p>The service provider leads a board that manages the service. The implementation of the service philosophy, vision and strategic direction is guided by clearly defined roles of governance and management. Additional staff, including an information technology team, support the operation and management of the service.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five home-based network reviews in the Kaliloa Education Limited organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Service documents and videos show that children are confident and comfortable in educators' homes. Environments are culturally responsive, well-resourced and child focused. Children have a strong sense of belonging and cultural identity, nurtured through connections with kainga, and the community.</p><p>Educators keep good records of each child’s day and note the activities that children participate in and enjoy. Cultural and spiritual beliefs are valued and used to inform planning. Children's experiences include learning through meaningful everyday experiences. Excursions and planned activities for children include literacy, mathematics and science, and the use of creative materials. Children have fun as they learn through play.</p><p>Children's learning is recorded in attractive portfolios and through online portals. The coordinator guides educators in planning group programmes. Portfolios shows the responses of educators' to children's interests and strengths and the provision they make specifically for infants and toddlers. Educators share their own cultural knowledge and often document children's learning activities in Tongan. Children's oral language skills, positive relationships with others and confidence in being part of group situations such as Fetakinima, are documented well.</p><p>Service leaders and the programme coordinator provide culturally appropriate monitoring and support for educators across the service. The coordinator affirms, models and sensitively encourages educators to improve their skills and understanding of effective teaching strategies. The coordinator's monthly visits to educators include monitoring health and safety practices in the home and building on educator knowledge of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. These visits are well documented. The coordinator is recognised for her skills, knowledge and values.The Tongan concept of tauhi vā is at the heart of respectful relationships, connectedness and service delivery.</p><p>There is a service-wide commitment to the vision, goals and strategic plan. Leaders are committed to continuous improvement through building the capabilities and skills of all educators and staff. They look for ways to promote educator success in the provision of home-based education and care and to address the needs of families. There is a robust induction process for new educators and ongoing support assists educators to increase their knowledge and improve practices. Coordinators are in regular contact with parents and welcome their feedback. Online secure portals provide effective ways of communicating with educators and parents, including televised weekly news.</p><p>The leaders and coordinator know their educators well. They personalise their communication to support needs and promote inclusive practices and effective ways of working with infants and toddlers. The coordinator encourages educators to increase their understanding and use of te reo and tikanga Māori. They could also help educators to better understand and respond to children's individual interests and learning dispositions.</p><p>The leaders' strong commitment to equity and social justice is evident in the way they work towards improving educational and social outcomes for the mainly Tongan children and their families. Strategic plans identify priorities that contribute to the service achieving its vision. Planning is linked to sound accountability practices and this supports consistent and sustainable practices across all networks<em>.</em></p><p>Highly effective health and safety systems are in place and provide assurance that legal requirements are being met. Monthly reports keep leaders informed about the physical and emotional wellbeing of children and about any issues to be addressed. Leaders are aware that the current appraisal system could be strengthened to promote more reflective practice.</p><p>Effective management and leadership underpin service operations. There is a strong commitment to continuous improvement. Recordkeeping and professional discussion are effective and there is a comprehensive framework of policies and procedures. Internal evaluation is well understood and a sound process is used. This could be enhanced by a more systematic evaluative approach to implementing and documenting the process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service leaders agree that key next steps for the service are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation practices and documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>coordinator reflection and inquiry into the effectiveness and impact of their practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders agree that key next steps for coordinator are to continue supporting educators to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop planning that builds on children's individual interests, strengths and dispositions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maximise opportunities for children to learn through child-initiated play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use te reo and tikanga Māori in daily programmes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engage in regular professional learning opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wonder Home-Based ECE completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Wonder Home-Based ECE will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>14 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
