</table><p>Yendarra Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Yendarra Kindergarten is licensed for up to 30 children over two years of age. It offers seven-hour days and serves a culturally diverse community. Most of the children enrolled have Pacific heritage.</p><p>The kindergarten is staffed by a newly appointed head teacher and two other registered teachers, a teaching assistant, teacher aide and administrator. Teachers have sustained many of the good teaching practices noted in ERO’s 2015 report.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy is based on manaakitanga and whanaungatanga. Teachers aim to provide an environment that encourages children to learn, create, invent, construct and problem solve. They also encourage children to become risk takers, independent communicators and socially confident.</p><p>The programme is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and a commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi. The indoor and outdoor learning environments have had significant improvements since the 2015 ERO report.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA), which provides leadership, a framework of policies and operational guidelines, support personnel and programmes of professional learning and development for staff. A new AKA structure and new leadership roles have been established, and new personnel appointed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children show a strong sense of ownership, responsibility and belonging in the kindergarten. They enjoy opportunities to explore, make choices and share their achievements with others. Children are accepting and respectful towards others of differing backgrounds, ages and abilities. They are confident and eager learners.</p><p>Children learn in a vibrant and welcoming environment that fosters their curiosity, responds to their interests and supports their sustained engagement in play. Resources, displays and equipment reflect the cultures of the children and community. Teachers ensure children have many opportunities to explore, learn about the natural world and be physically active in the spacious outdoor area. Children have fun, make choices and learn though intentional play.</p><p>Curriculum planning and implementation includes children's interests, strengths and ideas<em>.</em> Te reo and tikanga Māori are included in meaningful ways. Pacific children and families are well supported, and their languages and cultures are respected. Children engage in multi-cultural celebrations that include art, music and dance.</p><p>Teachers are culturally responsive. They foster equity and inclusion within the kindergarten in sensitive, caring ways. They have a strong focus on promoting children’s physical and emotional wellbeing. Children are well supported as they transition to school.</p><p>Documentation shows how teachers include children’s ideas and parents' aspirations in the programme. Children’s portfolios are good records of their engagement in the programme. Teachers are aware that they could increase their focus on planning for individual children and make the depth and continuity of their learning more visible over time.</p><p>Teachers know children well and encourage them to share their thoughts and ideas. They engage children in sustained conversations, sometimes using their home languages. Teachers’ caring and supportive interactions help children to use literacy, mathematics, science and technology concepts in meaningful ways. They encourage problem-solving, investigation and independence. Children are becoming self-managing learners.</p><p>Teachers have respectful and reciprocal relationships with children and their families and are building strong connections with the local community. They encourage parent and whānau engagement in their children's learning and invite them to share their knowledge and skills.</p><p>Kindergarten operations are guided by a comprehensive strategic plan and a shared vision, linked to the AKA’s strategic goals. The head teacher provides supportive professional leadership and encourages all staff to have leadership roles. Collaborative working relationships contribute to the developing team culture of trust, respect and ongoing improvement.</p><p>The AKA continues to provide support for kindergartens to strengthen bicultural practices. In many instances this has made a significant difference to teachers' confidence and capability. Specialist support impacts positively on teachers’ inclusion of children with additional learning needs. Priority is being given to re-establishing and supporting Parent Whānau Groups in all kindergartens. The strategic direction being established by new AKA leaders is providing a positive framework for kindergartens’ annual planning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teaching team has identified some useful next steps. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Strengthening their assessment of children's learning, programme planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the documentation of internal evaluation to more clearly show teachers' evaluative thinking and outcomes for children, and to guide kindergarten developments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to enrich bicultural practices in the kindergarten.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>It would be useful for AKA managers to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clarify new roles and engage teaching teams in the implementation of the new structure across the AKA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase the rigour of monitoring and quality assurance, and strengthen Internal evaluation at all levels of the AKA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify and implement strategies for achieving greater consistency of the practices that are strengths in some kindergartens, across the AKA.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Yendarra Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>13 February 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
