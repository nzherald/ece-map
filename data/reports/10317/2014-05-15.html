</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centre (20) Custom St West provides education and care for families who work in the inner city. The centre has been established for a long time and provides half and full day sessions for up to 119 children from birth to five years of age. The centre’s philosophy encompasses the values of children learning in a ‘safe and loving’ environment. Over 80% of teachers are registered.</p><p>The Kindercare Learning Centres governance and management organisation provides a wide range of systems to underpin centre operations. These include professional guidance, curriculum advice and a mentoring programme for provisionally registered teachers. A centre director manages the operation of the staff and the centre. Team Leaders have recently been appointed to provide additional support for the day-to-day running of the centre.</p><p>Children attending the centre are representative of the diverse ethnic groups in the local community. Staff work at providing special events at times when working families are best placed to attend. These events also provide good opportunities for parents and teachers to discuss children’s progress.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO review, the three learning centres in the complex have merged into one centre under the one licence. Managers report that this has had positive impact on the centre and on outcomes for children. The use of learning environments and routines has become more flexible and has allowed children to participate in a broader range of activities.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres (20) Custom St West is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Babies and toddlers are well cared for and have formed strong emotional bonds with their teachers. As a result they explore the environment confidently and enjoy their play. Teachers show skills in working with these very young children. They are responsive to children’s body language and attempts at verbal communication. Children benefit from a calm, supportive and unrushed environment in which to play and learn.</p><p>Older children are settled, confident and friendly. They enjoy interacting with their peers and with teachers. They are curious and enjoy exploring the centre’s different learning environments, making choices and engaging in the range of activities. High levels of affection and trust are evident between children and their teachers. As they grow and develop, children learn to take responsibility and to show leadership by the example they provide for their younger peers during routines and at mat times.</p><p>Parents are viewed by teachers as essential partners in supporting children’s learning. Some parents and teachers work together on specific goals to support children. Parent/teacher partnerships are trusting, respectful, collaborative and inclusive.</p><p>Play areas provided offer a good scope for learning that caters for the development of babies, toddlers, preschoolers and children who are transitioning to school. Good support is provided for children with special learning needs and for their families. Bicultural perspectives and a better understanding of Māori values are becoming more evident in the programme. Teachers are building an understanding of children’s diverse cultural backgrounds. This knowledge is helping teachers to plan more relevant programmes for children.</p><p>The centre’s curriculum planning is aligned to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers are increasingly noticing, recognising and responding to children’s emerging interests. There has been a positive shift from group learning to planning more frequently for children’s individual learning opportunities.</p><p>Teachers are given support to develop their professional knowledge and leadership skills. Appraisal systems are appropriately linked to the Registered Teacher Criteria. Teachers set goals and strategise ways to achieve them. The organisation recognises that a next step is to strengthen the implementation of the performance appraisal system to help teachers achieve higher quality learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Self review is used to evaluate the effectiveness of centre practices and is gradually bringing about improved learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centre managers and ERO agree that the quality of centre practices could now be raised through:</p><ul>
<li>the use of high quality practice indicators to monitor children’s learning progress</li>
<li>the development of an effective transition to school programme</li>
<li>the strengthening of centre self-review practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres (20) Custom St West completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres (20) Custom St West will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>15 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
