</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Kiwi's Learning Centre is a privately owned and operated early learning service in Whanganui. It provides education and care for children from two years to school age, five days a week for up to 30 children. At the time of this ERO review, eight of the children enrolled identified as Māori and 3 as Pacific heritage.</p><p>Daily operation is the responsibility of the centre manager who also provides support to the teaching team. A curriculum leader was employed in 2017 to provide teaching and learning leadership. Most teachers are fully qualified.</p><p>The June 2016 ERO report recommended the service consult with the Ministry of Education (MoE) and develop a plan to address areas identified for improvement. Including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing assessment, planning and evaluation practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building teachers’ capacity for internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing systems and processes that build leaders’ and teachers’ capabilities; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building sustainable governance and management practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The service received targeted support through the MoE funded programme, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO). Leaders developed a plan to address the key areas requiring improvement, in consultation with the MoE. Good progress has been made in addressing these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders and teachers have undertaken a well-considered review of their values and priority learning areas in consultation with parents, whānau, families and community. Key learning outcomes are very well understood by teachers and are embedded throughout the programme. The service has identified that its vision and philosophy needs to more clearly align to these priorities and involve its community in this process. ERO affirms this direction.</p><p>Curriculum implementation is now effectively led. There is a strong commitment to teaching and learning that contributes to improving outcomes for children. Literacy and numeracy learning is skilfully woven into play-based, child-led interactions. Positive learning outcomes from this approach are evident.</p><p>Whānau aspirations, and the service’s learning priorities, form the basis of strong individualised learning programmes for each child. A systematic approach is taken to the planning, assessment and evaluation of individual learning goals. Robust documentation processes show how teachers collaborate on a variety of effective, targeted teaching strategies which result in improved learning outcomes.</p><p>Te ao Māori is well promoted and evident in the centre. Children have opportunities to celebrate and share their whakapapa with their peers. Aspects of kaupapa Māori concepts are evident. Leaders and teachers have a commitment to growing their practices in this area. They are developing purposeful partnerships with local iwi representatives to build their capabilities to enrich the programme. ERO's evaluation affirms this.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported. Teachers, parents, whānau and external agencies work in collaboration to support these learners to fully participation in the programme.</p><p>The centre has recently implemented a revised internal evaluation framework. Leaders are working alongside the teaching team to build their evaluative understanding and capability. This has the potential to improve teacher practice and to enable them to evaluate the impact of their practices on children’s learning. ERO identified further development is needed to deepen aspects of the evaluation process.</p><p>A sound appraisal system is in place to support and grow teachers' capability. Specific goals focus on improving teacher practice. Observations provide a way for identifying good practice as well as informing next steps for development. Aligning leaders and teachers goals to the centre's strategic plan will further enhance this process.</p><p>A well-considered strategic plan guides the direction for the service. Leaders access external support to grow their leadership capabilities and to develop sustainable systems and processes to meet their goals and objectives.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities for improvement should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>aligning the centre's philosophy to the curriculum priorities and involving parents, families and whānau as part of this process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further developing understanding and use of internal evaluation for improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>incorporating appraisal goals to the service's strategic direction.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Kiwi's Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Kiwi's Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>22 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
