</table><p>Capital Kids Co-Operative is not well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Capital Kids Co-Operative is a non-profit early childhood service in central Wellington. Its premises are leased from the City Council by an incorporated society. It is run by parents and teachers in partnership, to provide education and care for a maximum of 30 children, including 12 up to two years. Of the 38 children enrolled, three identify as Māori.</p><p>The management committee takes collective responsibility for ensuring that children play and learn in a family-like environment. Building and maintaining respectful, trusting relationships is a priority.</p><p>The service philosophy, reviewed in 2018, reflects teachers' beliefs about nurturing children’s learning.</p><p>An acting centre manager has responsibility for the day-to-day management of the service. The service committee is currently recruiting for this position.</p><p>The July 2016 ERO report identified areas for development. These included: strengthening assessment, planning and evaluation; consistently integrating te reo Māori; and strengthening the internal evaluation processes. Little progress has been made in developing these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's sense of belonging is supported by responsive, respectful and nurturing relationships. They have access to a good variety of natural resources. Social competence is well promoted. Children play cooperatively. A calm atmosphere is evident.</p><p>Teachers regularly request and value parents' and whānau aspirations for their children and seek to respond to these. Routines for children are consistently implemented. Time is given to ensure infants and toddlers are well settled as they transition into the service.</p><p>Assessment for learning is not well understood. Since the previous ERO review teachers have developed curriculum statements for each learning space. These help inform parents about the centre programme. Service procedures that guide assessment practice, require improvement to clearly outline expectations for teachers' to implement quality assessment and plan for children's learning.</p><p>Individual children's portfolios, seen by ERO, were inconsistently maintained with some significant gaps between stories. Improved monitoring is required to ensure that planning for learning occurs frequently, consistently and is evident in assessment documentation.</p><p>Transitions to school are well supported. The service gathers a range of information from parents. Each child is taken on a planned visit to their school with teachers. This often includes a group of friends.</p><p>Self review and internal evaluation are not well understood or implemented. Developing a framework to assist leaders’ and teachers’ to understand and implement review is an area for improvement. This approach should highlight what they do in relation to current theories and practice in early childhood education and enable them to more critically evaluate their practice.</p><p>The learning environment should be enhanced through regular and systematic assessment and review of play spaces and resources. ERO identified that some of these spaces were cluttered and included damaged resources.</p><p>Teachers' are appraised annually, this supports them to identify areas for further development. The process would be more robust if it included:</p><ul>
<li>targeted observations of teacher practice, linked to identified goals</li>
<li>regular meetings throughout the appraisal cycle</li>
<li>meaningful feedback to deepen teachers' understanding about their teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><p>Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are evident in aspects of daily practice. Leaders are aware of the importance of continuing to build their bicultural knowledge and confidence to fully integrate aspects into their daily practice. Teachers are working with whānau Māori to identify aspirations and to support the learning and success of their tamariki.</p><p>The service strategic plan has useful goals to support the realisation of the centre vision of creating an excellent educational environment. The goals, if implemented could be used to develop staff capability through improved practice and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>A priority is to develop sustainable systems and processes, focused on the provision of high quality practices. Policies and procedures need to include relevant legislative and curriculum changes. This includes the identification of hazards and potential hazards in the environment and taking prompt action to eliminate, isolate and minimise risks to children and adults.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Capital Kids Co-Operative completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self review and internal evaluation for accountability and improvement of education and care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regular and systematic review of all policies and procedures, including the annual review of written emergency planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identifying and addressing health and safety issues relating to fittings, fire and earthquake documentation, earthquake risks and sleep records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>safety checking of workers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C2, HS1, HS6, HS7, HS8, HS9, GMA6, GMA7A]</em></p><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Capital Kids Co-Operative. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>29 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
