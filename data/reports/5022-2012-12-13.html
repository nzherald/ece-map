<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Hibiscus Coast Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. Kindergarten operations are efficient and well supported by the systems and personnel of the Northern Auckland Kindergarten Association (NAKA).</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Hibiscus Coast Kindergarten is well established in the coastal town of Orewa in Auckland. Staffing is stable, with some teachers having served considerable time in the kindergarten. All teachers hold full qualifications. Teachers&rsquo; professional capacity building is a blend of current ideas from newly trained teachers and the experience of those who have been in the kindergarten for a longer period of time.</p><p>The kindergarten is set in close proximity to local senior schools and the beach. This enables teachers and children to use large playing fields and local walks as extensions to the curriculum. Parents have some choice about the days and hours children attend, as the kindergarten operates up to six hours a day.</p><p>Children attending the kindergarten are between three and five years of age. Waiting list numbers mean that children are nearing four before they are able to attend. Children from several cultures attend the kindergarten.</p><p>Recent changes at Association level have given teachers a greater sense that their teaching and professional practice is valued. The development of Association review processes, and a focus on unifying kindergartens under Association jurisdiction, has been welcomed by teachers. Professional development is well supported.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in four early childhood education services within the Northern Auckland Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers worked together to develop a teaching philosophy that captures their emphasis <em>on Te Wh&#257;riki,</em> the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, and on Te Tiriti o Waitangi and bicultural understandings. Within these focus areas, teachers place high value on respectful relationships throughout the kindergarten. They welcome children as capable learners in an inclusive and challenging learning environment.</p><p>Children are settled, busy and engaged. Long, uninterrupted periods of free choice encourage concentration and collaboration between children. Friendships are evident and children play well together. Teachers arrange the high quality, plentiful resources to provide uncluttered space in which children can develop their play.</p><p>Teachers engage children in frequent affirming conversations. They make a point of valuing children&rsquo;s endeavours through these conversations, and by displaying stories about their achievements. Teachers know children well and facilitate, rather than direct, their play. Children are confident and competent learners.</p><p>Children have a growing understanding of, and ease in using, te reo M&#257;ori and respond with interest to M&#257;ori myths and legends. Teachers have accessed professional development to help them to learn further about te reo me on&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori. They use strengths within the team to support each other and build their confidence.</p><p>Teachers encourage a focus on literacy, numeracy and science in contexts familiar to children. Children practise writing and drawing and are highly engaged in stories and dramatisations. They enjoy working in and learning about their garden.</p><p>Planning processes are clearly evident in displays. Assessment portfolios containing individual information about each child are attractive, available, and enjoyed by parents and children.</p><p>ERO, Association managers and teachers discussed and agree on the following next steps for the kindergarten. Teachers will continue to:</p><ul>
<li>further strengthen self-review processes with a focus on evaluating the quality of the programme for children</li>
<li>ensure that portfolios clearly record children&rsquo;s progress over time, show their growth and development, and include teachers&rsquo; planning to support children&rsquo;s dispositions as learners</li>
<li>ensure the purposeful inclusion of parents&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s contributions in portfolios.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hibiscus Coast Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><p>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</p><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>13 December 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
