<a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2>
<p>Woodend Playcentre is one of 50 playcentres administered by the Canterbury Playcentre Association. The playcentre operates within the constitution of the association. The president of the association is also the licensee of all playcentres. Parent cooperatives are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the individual playcentres.</p>
<p>This is the first ERO review since April 2004. The playcentre experienced vandalism and a fire in 2008. Since this time, the playcentre has been rebuilt on the existing site. The Woodend Playcentre is well managed by a group of parents who focus on children’s learning and development. Clear roles and responsibilities support parents in sharing the management of the centre.</p>
<p>Positive features of the programme include:</p>
<ul><li>the positive relationships among parents that empower parents and children and promote strong friendships;</li>
<li>the purposeful way parents set up the learning environment to challenge and support children’s learning;</li>
<li>the strong focus parents have on developing children’s literacy and numeracy concepts; and</li>
<li>the way parents observe, identify and document children’s learning, dispositions and progress and use this information to plan the programme.</li>
</ul><p>The next steps for the supervisor and parents to improve outcomes for children are to:</p>
<ul><li>provide more opportunities for older children to develop independence and take responsibility;</li>
<li>review how well the environment and programme caters for the needs of infants and younger children; and</li>
<li>improve bicultural practices.</li>
</ul><p>Two earthquake hazards exist in the kitchen and main classroom. These are listed in section five of this report.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Woodend Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atWoodend Playcentre.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO’s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Woodend Playcentre philosophy describes the playcentre as a centre organised, maintained and supervised by parents. Parents are guided by the Canterbury Playcentre Association staff. The supervision team coordinates the learning opportunities that are offered to adults and children.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>Positive relationships exist among children and playcentre parents. New parents are warmly welcomed and supported by a member of the committee. Parents said that the family environment and friendships that are established at playcentre empower both children and adults.</p>
<p>Children learn in a challenging and creative environment. A range of high quality learning resources supports children’s interests. The daily environment reflects children’s current interests and provides a rich learning environment for children to explore. The large outdoor environment supports children’s physical play.</p>
<p>The promotion of literacy and numeracy concepts is a strength of Woodend Playcentre. The parents focus their teaching on providing opportunities for increasing children’s understanding and awareness of numeracy and literacy. A good range of tools, prompts and posters support this learning. Parents’ skills include storytelling, reading and music.</p>
<p>Parents are skilled at following children’s interests. The supervision team has developed visual prompts to guide parents in questioning and following children’s next steps in learning. Parents share information with one another to identify children’s learning. Parents are gaining parenting and teaching skills by working in this way.</p>
<p>Programme planning and assessment are based on children’s emerging interests. Good systems guide parents in recording children’s learning. These guidelines include how to write learning stories and identify children’s next steps, and how to record daily reflections and evaluations. High expectations from the supervision team have encouraged parents to write about children’s goals, interests and next steps in learning.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p>Strengthening bicultural practice. The parents and supervisor have identified that they need to strengthen the way they include biculturalism in the programme. The playcentre has developed a statement which identifies the activities and practices that support the inclusion of a bicultural partnership. Parents have attended workshops facilitated by the association.</p>
<p>Meeting the needs of older children. ERO observed older children who could be more involved in taking responsibility for their learning and self-management skills. Not all parents choose to keep their child at playcentre until starting school. Parents have identified that a survey will support them to understand what would encourage parents to keep older children at the playcentre longer.</p>
<p>Catering for the under two-year-old children. The numbers of parents with younger children have increased since the centre reopened in 2009. The supervisor and parents agreed with ERO that they should now review the area they have developed for this age group to see how well the environment and programme is meeting the needs of the babies and younger children.</p>
<a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long-term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Literacy Teaching and Learning</h3>
<p>When children understand, enjoy, engage with, and use language and symbols they are better able to express their individual identity and become active participants in a literate society. As part of this review, ERO looked at literacy practices, particularly the opportunities provided for children to develop strong literacy learning foundations.</p>
<p>In this service children’s literacy learning opportunities included:</p>
<ul><li>children’s learning stories and learning profiles being easily accessible for reading;</li>
<li>a puppet theatre with a wide variety of finger and hand puppets;</li>
<li>a wide variety of books, tapes and associated interactive puzzles;</li>
<li>a writing corner with a range of writing materials, alphabet chart and writing instruments;</li>
<li>a science corner with practical activities for children to complete;</li>
<li>art, mathematics and collage tables with challenging tasks;</li>
<li>parents reading stories to children; and</li>
<li>fun with rhymes and songs accompanied by musical instruments.</li>
</ul><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Woodend Playcentre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legislative obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>During the course of the review, ERO identified some areas of non-compliance. The microwave in the kitchen and the fish tank in the main playroom are unsecured. In order to address these, the licensee must:</p>
<div><ol><li>
<p>ensure that as far as reasonably practicable, hazards to the safety of children are corrected, repaired, removed or made inaccessible to children.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<p>[R24(4) Education (Early Childhood Centres) Regulations 1998]</p>
<a id="5-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Recommendations</h2>
<p>ERO and the centre management agreed that to improve outcomes for children they would:</p>
<ol><li>further develop and strengthen bicultural practices that are outlined in the centre’s policy; and</li>
<li>extend programme experiences to include more appropriate activities and learning areas for older children and toddlers and infants.</li>
</ol><a id="6-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6. Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>

<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-woodend-playcentre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Woodend Playcentre</h2>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office’s latest report on Woodend Playcentre.</p>
<p>Woodend Playcentre is one of 50 playcentres administered by the Canterbury Playcentre Association. The playcentre operates within the constitution of the association. The president of the association is also the licensee of all playcentres. Parent cooperatives are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the individual playcentres.</p>
<p>This is the first ERO review since April 2004. The playcentre experienced vandalism and a fire in 2008. Since this time, the playcentre has been rebuilt on the existing site. The Woodend Playcentre is well managed by a group of parents who focus on children’s learning and development. Clear roles and responsibilities support parents in sharing the management of the centre.</p>
<p>Positive features of the programme include:</p>
<ul><li>the positive relationships among parents that empower parents and children and promote strong friendships;</li>
<li>the purposeful way parents set up the learning environment to challenge and support children’s learning;</li>
<li>the strong focus parents have on developing children’s literacy and numeracy concepts; and</li>
<li>the way parents observe, identify and document children’s learning, dispositions and progress and use this information to plan the programme.</li>
</ul><p>The next steps for the supervisor and parents to improve outcomes for children are to:</p>
<ul><li>provide more opportunities for older children to develop independence and take responsibility;</li>
<li>review how well the environment and programme caters for the needs of infants and younger children; and</li>
<li>improve bicultural practices.</li>
</ul><p>Two earthquake hazards exist in the kitchen and main classroom. These are listed in section five of this report.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>
