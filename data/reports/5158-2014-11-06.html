</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Shirley Muir Kindergarten is located in Hamilton, is open throughout the year and provides both full-day and sessional education, for children from two years to school age in mixed-age groups. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 40 children over the age of two years at any one time. At the time of this ERO review, 55 children were enrolled, of whom 14 are identified as Māori.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable Trust, and does not operate for profit. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement, ’Every child reaching their full potential’. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. All kindergartens provide an <em>Enviroschoo</em>ls focus as a key curriculum feature to encourage children to better understand caring for the environment.</p><p>The Educational Service Manager (ESM) monitors and reports to the association on the kindergarten’s quality of education. A kaumātua from Tainui provides advice, guidance and support about Māori language, culture and identity. The kindergarten’s administrative responsibilities are well supported by association resource personnel.</p><p>The kindergarten benefits from WKA’s clear guidelines and expectations for practice and the availability of good self-review processes for monitoring and evaluating the quality of education and care it provides for children.</p><p>The kindergarten has a team of four qualified teachers that includes an experienced and long-standing head teacher and three teachers. The kindergarten is well supported by the experienced and efficient administration person. At the time of this ERO review a new and experienced head teacher was soon to join the team.</p><p>Since ERO’s last review in 2011 there have been significant changes to kindergarten hours in response to changing community needs and population trends. These changes have resulted in increased numbers of younger children attending.</p><p>The team’s shared philosophy is clearly documented and places value on encouraging parents, whānau and the community to contribute to the programme. It also acknowledges Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The kindergarten’s treaty is used as a foundation for establishing rules and expectations with the children each year.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 12 kindergarten reviews in the Waikato Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Shirley Muir Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Positive relationships between teachers, children and their families are based on mutual respect and trust. There is an inclusive, welcoming and family like atmosphere in the kindergarten. Parents who spoke to ERO appreciate teachers’ approachability and their support for them in their role of parenting young children.</p><p>Teachers have recently reviewed the kindergarten programme and routines. Changes made have resulted in increased opportunities for children to make choices and engage in more sustained and uninterrupted play and learning. Children also enjoy both planned and spontaneous teacher-led experiences such as mat times, music, games and story reading.</p><p>The kindergarten environment is well designed and resourced to foster children’s independence, imagination, creativity, confidence and physical skills. Children also have many opportunities within the child-initiated programme to explore and develop their interests, skills and knowledge in aspects of literacy and mathematics. Teachers give priority to developing children’s social and communication skills.</p><p>Teachers regularly use te reo Māori and integrate aspects of tikanga Māori practices into the programme. The mixed-age group supports Māori concepts and values such as whanaungatanga and tuakana/teina, where children make whānau connections, and older or more capable tamariki support and encourage younger learners. There are many opportunities for children to explore and make links to the wider community through planned outings and visitors to the kindergarten.</p><p>Teachers regularly talk with parents about their child’s participation in the programme. Parents appreciate seeing their children in photos and stories displayed in the kindergarten, and children’s profile books. The recently developed whānau tree has given parents an opportunity to share some aspirations and goals for their children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, kindergarten leaders and teachers agree that important next steps for the kindergarten are for teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>more effectively use the expertise of the ESM, enabling them to more critically reflect on their practice, collaborate as a team and implement strategic self review to guide continuous improvement.</li>
<li>strengthen their partnerships with whānau and tangata whenua along with knowledge of kaupapa Māori concepts, to build on their understanding of te reo, tikanga and local Māori history.</li>
<li>continue to review and research ‘best practice’ for recognising and responding to toddlers as capable and confident learners in a mixed-age setting.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, there is a need for the teaching team to continue to develop assessment, planning and evaluation practices to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>teachers’ shared understanding about effective assessment practice</li>
<li>teachers’ ability to notice, recognise and respond collaboratively in ways that support children to plan and extend their interests and learning</li>
<li>the role of parents in assessment and as partners in their child’s learning.</li>
</ul><p>Such improvements are likely to lead to greater depth and complexity to children's thinking, inquiries, learning, and belief in themselves as capable and confident learners.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Shirley Muir Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Shirley Muir Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>6 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
