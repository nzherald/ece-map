</table><p align="center" style="text-align: left;">Pongaroa Early Years is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Trustees and leaders are well positioned to address areas for further development identified in this report.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pongaroa Early Years is located in Tararua. It is licensed for 30 children including five children up to two years of age. Opening hours are from 8:30am until 3:15pm. The service is closed on Wednesdays and during school holidays.</p><p>The service is governed by a trust board. Maintaining fee-free early childhood opportunities in this small rural community is a focus for trustees.</p><p>A new staff team has recently been appointed. At the time of this ERO review, the majority had been in post for less than one term. A new head teacher was appointed in October 2018.</p><p>Prior to the appointment of the new staff team, limited progress had been made in response to the April 2016 ERO report. Recent initiatives show some development, however further work is required for improvement in several areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children lead their own learning in an environment well organised to support their exploration. They participate enthusiastically in a range of learning experiences. Children are engaged, curious, confident and independent.</p><p>Leaders recognise that the service philosophy requires review. ERO's evaluation confirms this is a priority. Consideration should be given to articulating the valued outcomes for children and a curriculum to promote these.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are responsively and consistently cared for. One-on-one interactions support their sense of security. They are given space and time to lead their own learning.</p><p>The bicultural curriculum is continuing to strengthen. Te ao Māori is an integral part of children's early learning experience. Adults are continuing to strengthen their use of meaningful te reo Māori.</p><p>Teachers are in the early stages of exploring approaches to support educational success for Māori children.</p><p>The quality of assessment is variable. Consistently identifying children's individual learning and showing progress over time is an area that continues to require strengthening. Deliberate individualised planning is emerging. Further development of assessment practice should show:</p><ul>
<li>planning and intentional teaching for individual children</li>
<li>how learning is progressed over time</li>
<li>connections to culture, language and identity</li>
<li>response to parent aspirations and perspectives.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, a system to monitor the quality of children's assessment should be developed.</p><p>Teachers are beginning to inquire into their practice to identify areas for improvement. Developing the teaching team's evaluative capacity to measure how effectively centre practices promote positive outcomes for children remains a priority.</p><p>The appraisal system should be strengthened to ensure that teachers' development is well supported. Improvements should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>teachers' goals align to <em>The Standards for the Teaching Profession</em></li>
<li>targeted observations of teacher practice contribute to their appraisal.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers work collaboratively and contribute to improvements within the service. Leaders should now consider how to facilitate sharing of knowledge and expectations of practice within the context of the service.</p><p>Trustees have worked collaboratively and have undertaken external professional learning to strengthen their knowledge and understanding of governance roles and responsibilities. They are future-focused and have been instrumental in promoting improvements in the curriculum and teacher practice. A sound framework of policies and procedures support ongoing operation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified that key next steps are for leaders and teachers to continue to develop shared expectations and practice in relation to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum expectations to support valued outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strategies that promote educational success for Māori children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>meaningful appraisal.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>Trustees and leaders of Pongaroa Early Years will develop an action plan that details how they plan to address these priorities. Progress against this plan will be monitored by ERO.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pongaroa Early Years completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>The service needs to improve its performance in relation to hazard identification. Since the on-site stage of the ERO review, the manager has taken action to address this.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>13 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
