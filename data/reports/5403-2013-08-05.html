</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Nelson South Kindergarten provides education and care for up to 40 children, five mornings per week. Three afternoon sessions are offered for the younger children and family groupings. Children come from a wide range of backgrounds and for many families, English is an additional language.</p><p>The teaching team is fully qualified and the programme is further enhanced through support staff and volunteers from the community. The kindergarten vision emphasises the importance of a well resourced, nurturing environment. Curiosity is fostered and cultural diversity is recognised and strongly evident in practice.</p><p>The kindergarten is a member of the enviro-schools project and sustainable practices are beginning to form part of the regular programme. The Family Liaison group leads fundraising initiatives to support ongoing resourcing and improvements to the kindergarten environment.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Nelson Kindergarten Association (the association) and overseen by a team of Senior Education Advisors (SEAs). The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO. This review was part of a cluster of eleven kindergarten reviews in the Nelson Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are friendly, respectful and responsive to children and families. They understand the importance of relationships and encourage parents to participate in the kindergarten programme. A range of effective strategies is used by teachers to communicate with families who have English as an additional language.</p><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging in the kindergarten and confidently share their place with visitors. There are many opportunities for children to read, write and explore early mathematical concepts in the programme. Information and communication technologies are used intentionally to enhance learning opportunities for children. The curriculum is clearly linked to the principles and strands of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Planning is responsive to individual children&rsquo;s interests, strengths and needs. Well presented profiles highlight children&rsquo;s engagement in the programme and their learning.</p><p>A strong commitment is evident to a bicultural programme. Teachers take personal responsibility for using te reo M&#257;ori accurately and meaningfully in their conversations with children and parents. Children respond knowledgeably. Aspects of appropriate tik&#257;nga M&#257;ori are integrated well into the programme. A vision for success for M&#257;ori as M&#257;ori in this context is being explored by teachers, families and other appropriate personnel.</p><p>Good use is made of the available space. Children are able to move about freely, choosing from a wide range of high quality resources. The environment is inviting and vibrant. It reflects a range of cultural artefacts representing the cultural backgrounds of the children. Teachers have identified that exploring success for Pacific children in this context is a next step for them. ERO affirms this direction.</p><p>Teachers engage in ongoing research. They are highly reflective practitioners and are committed to keeping up-to-date with professional learning and development. Spontaneous review has been used to reflect on aspects of the programme and inform ongoing improvements. There is strong alignment between the guiding documents of the association and kindergarten and the resulting review. Teachers and the association are highly consultative, regularly requesting and receiving feedback from their parent community. The association has effectively led robust review and evaluation using a collaborative approach.</p><p>The association provides high levels of guidance and support for teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clear guiding documents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>expectations for programme delivery and kindergarten operations, including health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>access to a wide range of professional learning and development opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The recently updated appraisal process is collaborative and provides clear guidance and support to staff. Leaders are engaging in ongoing professional learning in this area to assist successful implementation. ERO&rsquo;s evaluation supports this direction and recommends this approach include a focus on the quality of feedback and feed forward for ongoing teacher development.</p><p>The SEA regularly visits the kindergarten and provides support and leadership to the teaching team. Through SEA guidance and identified next steps teachers are well supported to provide positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>show, through the assessment documentation, how depth and complexity has been added to children&rsquo;s learning to more effectively highlight progress overtime</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to build the evaluative capacity of teachers to systematically enquire into and judge the effectiveness of their kindergarten operations. This should assist future decision-making and identify priorities to further enhance children&rsquo;s learning and wellbeing.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nelson South Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Nelson South Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>5 August 2013</p><p><img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/ERO-s-Approach-to-Reviews-in-Early-Childhood-Services-DRAFT-2012"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
