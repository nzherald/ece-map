</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waituna West Playcentre is one of 19 administered by the Central Districts Playcentre Association (the association). This review is one of ten undertaken by ERO in the association’s playcentres during Term 4, 2014.</p><p>The centre is open for two mornings per week and caters for children from birth to six years of age. Responsibility for day-to-day operations is undertaken by centre-elected office holders. A paid supervisor supports parents and whānau to develop and implement the daily programme. Professional advice and feedback to strengthen members’ practice is provided by a liaison officer employed by the association. At the time of this review, all parents at this centre are undertaking Playcentre training. This playcentre has positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>Playcentres' philosophy statement, 'whānau tupu ngātahi – families growing together’, encapsulates the value this organisation places on families and whānau working collectively to support children’s learning.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation is currently reviewing the organisational structure of Playcentre across New Zealand. The outcomes of this review may result in changes to operation at centre level.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The curriculum is child led, with strong links to <em>Te Whāriki</em> and playcentre philosophy. Children are well supported and nurtured by their parents and other adults. Information provided by centre adults guides them in their understanding of each child’s personality, communication skills and particular needs. Infants and toddlers are able to explore, interact, play and have fun with attentive adults and each other.</p><p>The supervisor models written assessment of children's learning to members. Some members are becoming confident to write their own learning stories. Portfolios are attractive records of children’s time at playcentre. Planning is informed by children’s interests, parent ideas and session evaluations. Centre members have identified that increased parent confidence and involvement in assessment, planning and evaluation is a next step for development.</p><p>Vibrant and stimulating indoor and outdoor spaces are organised to encourage children to learn, explore, develop their physical skills and engage in imaginative and creative play. Literacy, numeracy and mathematical learning are appropriately integrated throughout the curriculum.</p><p>Adults are working to ensure children have experiences that assist them to become confident in Aotearoa New Zealand’s dual cultural heritage. Acknowledged next steps are to continue to develop strategies and approaches to effectively promote Māori children’s success as Māori.</p><p>Waituna West Playcentre is situated in the grounds of Waituna West School. A reciprocal, two-way partnership has been established resulting in a seamless and well-supported transition between centre and school.</p><p>A high level of cooperation and trust is evident among all adults involved in the service. Collaborative ways of working enable parents to be actively involved in the learning and wellbeing of children. The supervisor and association liaison officer encourage leadership among members, according to their interests and areas of expertise. This contributes to the centre’s long-term sustainability.</p><p>Centre members have a good understanding of the purpose of self review to guide improvement and change. Planned self review is becoming evaluative and focuses on improving learning outcomes for children. Centre members acknowledge continued strengthening of review practice is an ongoing development.</p><p>Useful support is provided by the association. This includes written guidelines and systems for managing finance and legislative obligations. Work is being completed to improve employment practices. Regular visits from the liaison officer assist members in their management and teaching roles. A review of the liaison officer role is being undertaken to support an improved approach.</p><p>The appraisal process, particularly for those employed as team leaders and liaison officers, needs further development. The provision of ongoing professional, constructive feedback based on observations of practice, and linked to identified needs and goals, should add rigour.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At association level, the priorities are the further development of:</p><ul>
<li>members’ understanding of assessment, planning, evaluation and self review</li>
<li>liaison support so it is consistently effective in identifying and responding to centre needs</li>
<li>appraisal for employees</li>
<li>members’ understanding about te ao Māori</li>
<li>strategies that promote awareness of playcentre in the local community to improve the centre roll.</li>
</ul><p>At centre level, the priorities are:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to develop assessment, planning and evaluation of children’s learning</li>
<li>strengthening self review</li>
<li>using strategies and approaches to effectively promote Māori children’s success as Māori.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waituna West Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waituna West Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>19 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
