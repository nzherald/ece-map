</table><p>The BestStart Educare organisation will need to maintain close support for the centre to sustain and continue building on recent improvements in provision for children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Waterview operates in an adapted residential property in a quiet street near Avondale. It provides care and education for up to 40 children, with older children in the Oaktree room and up to 14 infants and toddlers in the Acorn room. Both rooms provide good access to a large outdoor learning environment.</p><p>In 2008 the centre was part of the ABC organisation and by 2012 had become part of Kidicorp, which is now known as BestStart Educare. The BestStart organisation provides a framework for all areas of centre operations. Business and professional services managers support the centre and monitor its practices. The acting centre manager works with the head teacher, who has responsibility for teaching and learning in the centre. All these centre leaders are new to their roles in 2015. The team of four registered teachers and other staff have responded well to new leadership approaches.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s 2012 ERO report noted improvements in centre practices since concerns had been identified in earlier reviews. ERO suggested further improvements to extend children&rsquo;s learning and to engage with the community. Since 2012 the layout and use of the building has been significantly improved. New centre leaders have supported positive developments in teaching and learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at ABC Waterview have a secure sense of belonging in the centre. They play together well. Teachers encourage children to develop positive social relationships and are increasingly supporting children&rsquo;s independent choice and self management. The centre has a home-like, family atmosphere.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well cared for in a calm, relaxed environment. Teachers&rsquo; interactions and relationships with children are respectful and nurturing. They are responsive to these younger children&rsquo;s needs and communication cues. Centre leaders are planning appropriately to reduce numbers and improve facilities in the Acorn room and to focus more purposefully on fostering children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>There are examples of teachers engaging particularly well, and having fun with children in their learning. Teachers are becoming more skilled at prompting extended, meaningful conversations with children. Some are actively promoting bicultural awareness and using phrases in te reo M&#257;ori as they interact with children.</p><p>Children in the Oaktree room enjoy music, as well as creative and constructive play. Literacy and maths concepts are included throughout the programme and children&rsquo;s learning in these areas is well supported by teachers. Science equipment is displayed to foster children&rsquo;s curiosity. Some children sustain their interest in learning activities for long periods.</p><p>Improvements in the building layout and in learning resources have supported positive outcomes for children. Further planned developments should result in better flow between play areas and an increase in the quality and availability of educational resources.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s individual assessment portfolios show that teachers know children well. They provide a good record of children&rsquo;s participation in the programme and their developing dispositions for learning. Teachers encourage parents/wh&#257;nau to contribute to portfolios and have recently asked them to share their aspirations for their children. Teachers are working to strengthen their partnerships with wh&#257;nau and to increase their responsiveness to families&rsquo; cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The teaching team has successfully increased the visibility of learning in the centre, through attractive displays that children, parents and teachers can use to prompt discussion about recent activities. Centre leaders are encouraging teachers to plan more purposefully so the programme is more responsive to children&rsquo;s individual and group strengths and interests.</p><p>With careful guidance from the new BestStart managers and the acting centre manager, staff have become a more cohesive team with growing shared understandings about their roles and responsibilities. They are increasing their professional knowledge about teaching and learning and beginning to actively contribute to centre developments.</p><p>Management practices are now more transparent and understood by all staff. While managers and teachers use a variety of self-review processes, the centre manager and head teacher recognise the need to formalise self review. Recent improvements provide a sound foundation for further development, which will require robust self review and focused, professional leadership.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers have developed an action plan to help the teaching team address areas for improvement identified through the BestStart quality assurance process. The implementation and regular review of this plan should result in further positive developments, including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>more regular, in-depth and critical evaluation of the quality of teaching and learning, with a clear focus on enhancing outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>better linked assessment and planning that results in more focused and deliberate teaching and a more responsive, stimulating and challenging programme for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing improvements in both indoor and outside learning environments.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Managers have an appropriate focus on continually improving teaching and learning in the centre, through strengthening leadership, targeted professional development for teachers, and ongoing robust self review.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Waterview completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Waterview will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>23 June 2015</p><h4>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h4><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
