</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Villa is situated at Ngongotaha. It provides education and care for children from birth to school age five days a week. At the time of this ERO review, 36 of the children enrolled identified as Māori.</p><p>Most teachers are fully qualified. Day-to-day operation of the early learning service is the responsibility of the centre manager who supports the teaching team.</p><p>The July 2015 ERO report identified areas requiring further improvement. These included: strengthening strategic self review; teachers input into the strategic plan; building teachers’ understanding and use of assessment tools; and enhancing the appraisal process. Ongoing progress has been made to address these areas.</p><p>Little Villa was purchased by Provincial Education Group Limited in August, 2014. Provincial Education Group (the organisation) provides governance and management support. A substantial management team oversees a number of services nation-wide. This includes a professional leader who provides support and guidance to centre staff. Te Tiriti o Waitangi principles are central to the organisation's philosophy and practices.</p><p>The organisation's philosophical underpinnings emphasise whanaungatanga, rangatiratanga, ako, whakamana, kotahitanga, whānau tangata and ngā hononga.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review, the outdoor space has undergone significant developed to provide additional learning opportunities for children.</p><p>This review was one of a cluster of seven in the Provincial Education Group Limited.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have opportunities to participate in a play-based programme. They experience warm and positive relationships. Teachers are respectful, responsive, notice children’s interests, work alongside them and extend their learning.</p><p>Teachers sensitively and effectively respond to and support infants’ and toddlers’ needs for building strong and secure attachments with their caregivers. Teachers have created a calm and unhurried learning environment for these children.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported to enable them to participate in the programme. Where appropriate, external agencies are accessed.</p><p>It is timely for the service to develop, in partnership with parents, Māori whānau and their Pacific community, a philosophy that encompasses the organisational underpinnings and reflects its place and community context. As part of this work, leaders, teachers and families should consider ways they can develop indicators of good practice that guide and support effective implementation. This should provide a foundation for teachers to develop meaningful learning partnerships and deepen their understanding of what educational success for Māori and Pacific children looks like.</p><p>Children portfolios shows ongoing observations of their interests, developing friendships and participation in the programme. The planning for learning framework should be more reflected in the assessment cycle. Further strengthening is required in:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>deepening the analysis of the learning in children's stories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>showing complexity and progression over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>celebrating children’s culture, language and identity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Kaupapa Māori concepts such as manaakitanga, whanaungatanga and wairuatanga are well integrated into curriculum. Teachers use te reo Māori skilfully when engaging with children. Celebrating Māori culture and language enables children to gain a greater understanding of te ao Māori.</p><p>An effective internal evaluation system has been implemented. This provides clear expectations that guides the process. Leaders should continue to build teachers’ capability to evaluate so they can effectively measure the impact of the curriculum and their practices on children’s outcomes.</p><p>A recent parent survey has provided useful feedback for leaders and teachers. The centre has been responsive to aspects of this feedback.</p><p>The appraisal process provides a sound framework for teachers to reflect on and improve their practice. Further consideration should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing clear, specific, measurable goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>defining the purpose for observations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aligning the professional learning and development to teachers' goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The organisation's senior leadership has high expectations for teacher practice. Systems and processes are in place to promote improvements for the benefit of children and whānau. Teachers are encouraged to grow their understanding and take on distributed leadership roles.</p><p>A well-considered policy framework is in place to guide teacher practice. The organisation places considerable emphasis on the health, safety and wellbeing of children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that their priority next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>work collaboratively with parents, whānau and families to develop the philosophy and identify indicators of good practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build internal evaluation capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen the appraisal process.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO and Provincial Education Group agree that to further strengthen practice, their next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establish nationally consistent reporting frameworks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitor the progression of strategic goals, through measurement of improved outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use formal internal evaluation processes at senior leadership level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase opportunities for whānau to actively contribute to the organisation’s strategic direction.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Villa completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Villa will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>24 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
