</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Opotiki Community Childcare Centre situated on the Opotiki College site, provides full-day education and care for children from birth to school age. This not-for-profit centre is governed by a committee consisting of teachers and parents. The centre is licensed for 55 children including 15 aged up to two years. Its roll of 62, includes 32 children of Māori descent.</p><p>The centre operates two age-based areas, one for children under two and an over two area. For an hour each morning children in the over two area are separated into two groups to provide more specific age-related learning programmes.</p><p>The centre’s recently reviewed philosophy makes a commitment to providing a warm, caring, open and fun learning environment. It acknowledges the importance of working in close partnership with whānau.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review, leadership of the centre has remained the same and there have only been two changes in the teaching team. Teachers have participated in externally provided professional development to strengthen their understanding of te reo and tikanga Māori. There has been considerable development to the centre’s facilities, including the establishment of a separate indoor area for children under the age of two. Centre leaders and teachers acknowledge the need to further develop the outdoor play areas to provide a more natural environment and increased space for children to explore and develop their physical skills.</p><p>An after-school care and school holiday programme for local primary school children continues to operate at the centre.</p><p>Opotiki Community Childcare Centre has a positive ERO reporting history.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The governance committee, consisting of experienced members, provides effective centre governance. The committee is well informed about centre operations and has developed a useful plan for ongoing centre development. The centre’s finances are well managed. Committee members are very supportive of the centre manager and teachers, and generously fund them for their ongoing professional learning and development.</p><p>The centre continues to benefit from the leadership of an experienced and knowledgeable centre manager and assistant manager. They have clear expectations for centre operations and effective teaching practices. The centre manager leads useful self-review processes that contribute to ongoing centre development. Teachers value the supportive professional leadership provided by the centre manager and assistant manager.</p><p>The programme is a combination of teacher-led and child-initiated activities. Literacy and mathematics learning experiences are a feature of teacher-led sessions. Particular strengths of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>the meaningful inclusion of te reo and tikanga Māori into all aspects of the centre</li>
<li>frequent trips into the local and wider community</li>
<li>opportunities for children to experience safe physical challenge</li>
<li>a focus on science learning</li>
<li>many opportunities for whānau and local community members to share their knowledge and expertise with children.</li>
</ul><p>Individual learning profiles provide a comprehensive record of each child’s participation in the programme. They are easily accessible at the centre for children to revisit their learning. A recent initiative has been to make these accessible to whānau in an on-line format.</p><p>Teachers work well together in the best interests of children. They have established positive and affirming relationships with children and their whānau and are committed to working in partnership with whānau for the benefit of children. ERO observed teachers actively participating alongside children supporting sustained play. Children’s care needs are well met and teachers are encouraging children to develop self-care skills. Well-managed processes have been developed that support children as they transition between the age-based rooms and when they move on to school.</p><p>Children up to the age of two benefit from caring and nurturing relationships with their teachers. A particular feature of the programme in the under-two area is the incorporation of waiata and music activities. Teachers support parents care preferences and routines for their babies and toddlers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the centre are to</p><ul>
<li>access centre-wide teacher professional development to strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation processes. This should support teachers to more effectively notice, recognise and respond to children’s learning</li>
<li>review the balance between teacher-led and child-initiated activities to support teachers to provide a programme that is more responsive to children’s interests</li>
<li>review children’s access to a wide range of learning resources and equipment.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Opotiki Community Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Opotiki Community Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>15 June 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
