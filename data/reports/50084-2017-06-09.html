</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Redwood provides education and care for children from birth to five years of age. Children learn and play in two separate areas, designed specifically for the needs of different age groups, five days a week. The service is licensed for 70 children, including up to 20 aged up to two years. Of the 87 children enrolled, 13 identify as Māori and four as Pacific.</p><p>Since the July 2013 ERO evaluation, the centre's license allows for an increased number of children, and two new head teachers have been appointed. Most teachers are fully qualified and represent a range of cultures. Day-to-day operation of the centre is the responsibility of the manager, who supports the head teachers.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified areas requiring further improvement. These included continuing to improve outcomes for children by addressing the findings of the centre's internal evaluation.Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>ABC Redwood is owned and operated by BestStart Educare Ltd. BestStart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd), a large organisation that owns early childhood services across New Zealand.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of two in BestStart Educare Ltd.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy has been recently reviewed in collaboration with parents and whānau, and guides the service's direction. A supporting document guides implementation. It is timely to evaluate how evident the learning outcomes are within the philosophy and vision statements.</p><p>Children are confident and competent learners who are encouraged to make decisions. They have opportunities to challenge themselves and develop their independence. Children inquire and lead their own learning within a supportive environment.</p><p>Teachers know children well. They use a range of teaching strategies to enhance their learning. Teachers are well supported to implement a curriculum that is responsive to children’s emerging skills, needs and interests. Literacy and mathematics are suitably woven throughout the programme.</p><p>Recent changes to planning for individual children, effectively support teachers to recognise, respond to and document children's learning. Leaders and teachers continue to refine planning for groups of children and develop consistency of practice. This should increase the focus on extending children's interests over time.</p><p>Children's profiles provide a useful record of their learning and development which is shared digitally with parents and whānau. Families are actively encouraged to participate in their child's learning through sharing aspirations and contributing to their child's profiles. Building strong relationships with parents, whānau, and the community is a centre focus.</p><p>Te ao Māori, including waiata Māori, is promoted in the centre. Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are woven into conversations with children. Leaders have identified that supporting teachers to increase their knowledge and understanding of te ao Māori is a next step. ERO affirms this direction.</p><p>Leaders and teachers continue to develop their understanding of educational success for Māori and Pacific children. Developing learning partnerships with whānau Māori and the Pacific community is a key next step. This should assist the centre to further reflect the cultures, languages and identities of these children.</p><p>Children up to two years are well supported within a calm, nurturing environment. Routines are flexible, unhurried and responsive to their needs. Teachers sensitively and respectfully respond to the daily rhythms of infants and toddlers.</p><p>Teachers work in partnership with families and external agencies to effectively provide for children requiring additional learning support. Learning goals are identified in children's individual development plans.</p><p>Children’s sense of belonging is nurtured through transitions within the centre. Relationships are being established with local schools as part of an ongoing focus on supporting children's transitions from the centre.</p><p>Internal evaluation is developing and is supported by a recently devised framework focused on improving outcomes for children. Teachers have identified the need to build a shared understanding of this process.</p><p>Leaders are improvement-focused. The collaborative teaching team is well supported by the centre manager and area manager who have a commitment to growing leadership. Teachers seek professional learning opportunities aligned to centre priorities.</p><p>A clear framework guides appraisal. This has a developmental focus and includes self reflection and appraiser assessment. Formal observations of practice provide useful information about the quality of teaching. In addition, teachers and leaders are building their capabilities through an inquiry and knowledge-building framework to help improve outcomes for children. BestStart provides opportunities to participate in a wide range of professional learning and development. </p><p>The area manager provides regular feedback, support and guidance about the curriculum in action. This clearly identifies strengths and areas for development. Roles and responsibilities of leaders and managers are clearly identified and well understood. A comprehensive policy framework, including procedures and systems, guides the operation of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that key next steps are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>refine assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop understandings of how teachers can promote and support educational success for Māori and Pacific children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Redwood completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to: </p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Redwood will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>9 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
