</table><p>Growing Minds Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Growing Minds Early Learning Centre is a well-established centre in Unsworth Heights, Auckland. The centre provides full-day education and care for up to 43 children, including, up to 13 under two years of age. The centre serves a multicultural community.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is aligned to the principles of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. It places value on children learning in a welcoming, respectful environment that caters for individual children's needs.</p><p>Centre staff consist of the owner, who manages the centre, seven other registered teachers and two teaching assistants.</p><p>ERO's 2016 report noted the positive relationships between the staff and children. Key next steps included continuing to move towards a more responsive, child-led curriculum. The report also suggested reviewing the centre philosophy, strategic goal and annual plan, and developing effective teaching and management structures. The centre has made good progress in some of these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s care and learning needs are well supported. They are warmly welcomed by staff on arrival and settle quickly. They show a strong sense of belonging in the centre. Children's wellbeing is nurtured through respectful relationships with teachers and each other.</p><p>Children make independent choices about play in a well-resourced environment. They play cooperatively with and alongside their peers for sustained periods of time. Their imagination and creativity are fostered during free play. Children’s oral language is promoted, and they express themselves confidently.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are provided with nurturing care, and they benefit from good adult-to-child ratios. Infants are supported to develop independence and to confidently explore the environment. Their individual needs are well catered for. Infants' early attempts at verbalisation are supported by teachers. They have easy access to the older children’s areas, which aids their transitions through the centre.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively to support children's learning. Some teachers use deeper questioning to promote more complexity in children's play. Opportunities for literacy and numeracy are naturally woven into the programme. Teachers’ commitment to biculturalism is evident in the environment. They respect children's cultures and their backgrounds. In particular, Māori and Pacific children's languages and cultures are included in the programme.</p><p>Planning and assessment practices are well documented. Teachers respond to children's interests in the programme. Children's assessment portfolios contain good information about their learning over time, and learning is linked to <em>Te Whāriki</em>. Online portfolios provide families with ready access to information about their children’s learning and involvement in the centre.</p><p>Leaders and teachers maintain respectful relationships with parents. There are good opportunities for leaders, teachers, parents and whānau to work collaboratively to support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Centre leadership is increasingly effective. Managers promote collaboration and staff wellbeing. They provide good opportunities for staff growth through well targeted internal and external professional development. Managers focus on improvement, and are beginning to foster emergent leadership across the staff.</p><p>The centre's direction is driven by the leader's vision. There is cohesion between the vision, strategic goals and annual plan which guide centre development. This is underpinned by a sound policy and procedures framework. Some good systems to monitor health and safety are in place. Internal evaluation is increasingly contributing to improved learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree their next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to develop assessment, planning and evaluation practices to better identify and document children's learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the provision for older children to provide greater challenge and complexity in their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen bicultural practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure thorough systems are maintained to monitor health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>expand internal evaluation practices by measuring the impact of initiatives on improving outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Growing Minds Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice, centre leaders must ensure that thorough systems to monitor health and safety practices are maintained.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>6 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed</li>
<li>Well placed</li>
<li>Requires further development</li>
<li>Not well placed</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
