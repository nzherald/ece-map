The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Rutland Street operates morning sessions from Monday to Friday and three afternoon sessions each week. It is licensed for 45 children over two years of age.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">The spacious, natural, learning areas provide interesting places for children to explore and make their own discoveries. Children have easy access to a wide range of quality resources and learning experiences.</p><p align="left">Teachers use a variety of effective teaching approaches to help children to develop their learning interests. They involve children in learning conversations that encourage children&rsquo;s deeper level of thinking and problem solving.</p><p align="left">Other positive features of this kindergarten are:</p><ul>
<li>positive, respectful relationships and a strong sense of belonging for children and families</li>
<li>children who enjoy each other&rsquo;s company and play well together</li>
<li>the way the programme encourages children&rsquo;s choice and independence</li>
<li>teachers' responsiveness to children&rsquo;s individual strengths</li>
<li>children benefit from a child-focused programme that encourages them to explore and develop their learning interests</li>
</ul><p align="left">literacy learning and science are strong focuses of the learning programme.</p><p align="left">Teachers use te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori naturally in ways that provide opportunities for children to experience the language and tikanga M&#257;ori in the programme.</p><p align="left">The teaching team has identified, and ERO agrees, that the next areas for development are to refine assessment and programme planning; and strengthen aspects of evaluation documentation.</p><p align="left">The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development.</p><p align="left">This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Rutland Street was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKidsfirst Kindergartens Rutland Street.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The kindergarten vision states that teachers will work to develop respectful reciprocal relationships, where children, their family and the wider community are valued. Partnerships between children and teachers provide opportunities to learn together.</p><p align="left">Teachers aim to provide stimulating and exciting learning areas that support challenge and enjoyment. The environment also encourages children&rsquo;s independence.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><h4>Relationships</h4><p align="left">Teachers foster positive, respectful relationships and a strong sense of belonging for children and families. Teachers warmly welcome children and families. Teachers know children well. They have a genuine interest and care for children. Parents share useful information with teachers to support children&rsquo;s learning and well-being. Many parents actively take part in and add value to the programme. Teachers have well established links with the local school that help to support the transition to school for children and families.</p><h4>Children&rsquo;s sense of belonging</h4><p align="left">Children are confident to make their own choices and remain engaged in their play for sustained lengths of time. They settle well into the kindergarten programme. Children have well developed social skills and play well with and alongside others. They are actively involved in cooperative and imaginative play, in small friendship groups. Children share and develop play ideas together. Their independence and self-help skills are encouraged by teachers.</p><h4>Teaching strategies</h4><p align="left">Teachers use a range of effective strategies that build on children&rsquo;s learning. They notice and respond appropriately to children&rsquo;s individual interests and needs. Teachers make good links between home and the kindergarten that help to build on children&rsquo;s prior learning. Teachers actively take part in children&rsquo;s play, extending their conversations and social skills. They encourage children&rsquo;s thinking and problem-solving skills. Teachers have high expectations for children&rsquo;s learning and behaviour. Teachers successfully support children&rsquo;s literacy and creative development. Many children have well developed art skills.</p><h4>Programme</h4><p align="left">Children benefit from a child-focused programme that encourages them to explore and develop their learning interests. Teachers foster a calm learning environment. Children have many opportunities to make choices and take responsibility in the programme. Children adapt the environment and add to their play ideas. They are familiar and responsive to well established routines that provide long periods of uninterrupted time. Teachers naturally integrate te reo M&#257;ori and tikanga M&#257;ori into the programme.</p><h4>Purposeful learning environment</h4><p align="left">Children are actively involved in a wide range of learning experiences in the spacious natural play spaces. Teachers provide learning areas that are attractive, well planned and inviting to children. Literacy learning and science are strong focuses of the learning programme. Children&rsquo;s work and ideas are valued and respectfully displayed. Attractive and well presented wall displays inform parents of children&rsquo;s current learning interest. Children have many opportunities to be involved in physical play.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><h4>Refining assessment and programme planning, and strengthening aspects of evaluation documentation</h4><p align="left">Since the previous ERO review, the teachers have made progress in aspects of children&rsquo;s assessment, programme planning and self-review documentation. To further enhance these aspects they now need to more clearly:</p><ul>
<li>show children&rsquo;s learning progress over time</li>
<li>show how children&rsquo;s assessment information is used to plan for individual and groups of children</li>
<li>describe the teaching practices they will use to extend children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>show the impact of the planned programme on children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><p align="left">They also need to:</p><ul>
<li>identify the practices they will use to build on individual children&rsquo;s prior learning</li>
<li>build on the teaching strategies used and make clear the impact these have on children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long-term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of Children with Moderate to Severe Special Needs</h3><p align="left">As part of this review, ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Although there are no children with identified moderate to severe special needs currently enrolled in this kindergarten, it is well placed to support children with moderate to severe special needs.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten has well established links with specialist agencies that have previously supported them to meet the needs of children and families with moderate to severe special needs. The teachers have previous experience and success in including children with special needs which families in the community are aware of. The kindergarten has developed positive relationships with families. This has been useful in supporting children and families during the transition into the kindergarten and then when they move off to school.</p><p align="left">Teachers state that strategies are shared with the school to benefit the child&rsquo;s learning during the initial transition to school. Regular sharing of children&rsquo;s progress and achievement has also occurred between the local school, other local early childhood services and the kindergarten.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Rutland Street completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-rutland-street" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Rutland Street</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kidsfirst Kindergartens Rutland Street.</p><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Rutland Street operates morning sessions from Monday to Friday and three afternoon sessions each week. It is licensed for 45 children over two years of age.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">The spacious, natural, learning areas provide interesting places for children to explore and make their own discoveries. Children have easy access to a wide range of quality resources and learning experiences.</p><p align="left">Teachers use a variety of effective teaching approaches to help children to develop their learning interests. They involve children in learning conversations that encourage children&rsquo;s deeper level of thinking and problem solving.</p><p align="left">Other positive features of this kindergarten are:</p><ul>
<li>positive, respectful relationships and a strong sense of belonging for children and families</li>
<li>children who enjoy each other&rsquo;s company and play well together</li>
<li>the way the programme encourages children&rsquo;s choice and independence</li>
<li>teachers' responsiveness to children&rsquo;s individual strengths</li>
<li>children benefit from a child-focused programme that encourages them to explore and develop their learning interests</li>
</ul><p align="left">literacy learning and science are strong focuses of the learning programme.</p><p align="left">Teachers use te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori naturally in ways that provide opportunities for children to experience the language and tikanga M&#257;ori in the programme.</p><p align="left">The teaching team has identified, and ERO agrees, that the next areas for development are to refine assessment and programme planning; and strengthen aspects of evaluation documentation.</p><p align="left">The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development.</p><p align="left">This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p></html>
