</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Pioneers is a privately owned early childhood centre that provides education and care services for its community. The centre is licensed for 42 children with a maximum of 10 children under two. The current roll stands at 69 children, most of who are of New Zealand European heritage with a small number of Māori, Pacific and Asian children. The centre offers a full day session for children. In 2016 the centre will be a preschool for four year olds only.</p><p>The centre philosophy is based on six key intention statements. These statements include an emphasis on learning through play, the importance of catering for individual needs, and the valuing of the unique bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. Centre staff encourage children to become independent lifelong learners.</p><p>The centre director and owner have a manager and nine staff. Seven staff are fully registered teachers, one staff member is provisionally registered, and one is in her second year of training. This is the first ERO report for Little Pioneers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and happy, they have good relationships with adults and play cooperatively with others. They participate well in the activities provided. Teachers know children well and are responsive to their interests. There are good opportunities for children to learn self-help skills and to develop independence.</p><p>In the under two's area infants and toddlers are well cared for with teachers taking the time to talk with parents. Teachers ensure that infants and toddlers needs are well catered for and that good monitoring processes are in place.</p><p>Teachers have integrated a variety of literacy, numeracy and science learning experiences into the learning programme. They incorporate te reo Māori into the programme, with teachers continuing to develop their skills in this area.</p><p>Programme planning responds to children’s interests. Teachers use deliberate acts of teaching to promote children's thinking and learning. Children's individual portfolios are valued records of their involvement in the programme. Some teachers are tracking interests and monitoring children’s learning well. It would now be useful for managers and teachers to reflect on ways in which they can further identify and respond to the diversity of children's needs.</p><p>Centre managers have a collaborative and inclusive working relationship with staff. There is a strong commitment to teacher professional development by management, with an ongoing focus on improving learning for children. Managers are supportive of student teachers from various learning institutions, providing them with opportunities to develop their teaching profession at the centre.</p><p>Centre practices are underpinned by a sound vision and philosophy, and a useful strategic and annual plan that guides the development of the centre. Good processes for self review are evident and include both spontaneous and strategic approaches to review. The centre involves parents in the review process and has a strong commitment to working in partnership with parents. Parents report that they have good communication and positive relationships with centre staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for the further development of centre practices include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to reflect on how well teachers identify and respond to the diversity of children's needs</li>
<li>managers continuing to develop the appraisal process to better reflect the practising teacher criteria, to ensure the process is inclusive of <em>Tātaiako - Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learner,</em> and to strengthen alignment between the centre vision, philosophy and the learning programmes</li>
<li>continuing to use annual planning goals to guide centre development.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Pioneers completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Pioneers will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>14 September 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-home-based-education-and-care-services/"></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
