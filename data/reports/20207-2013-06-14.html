<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Background</span></h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Princes Street Community Childcare governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the May 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>the quality of the programme</li>
<li>the quality of self review</li>
<li>the quality of management; and</li>
<li>any other issues that arise in the course of this review.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>2 Evaluation Findings</span></h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Princes Street Community Childcare operates in a heritage building in the CBD of Auckland. The centre is one of three operated by the Auckland Community Early Childhood Trust.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report found that strategic planning and self review were in the beginning phases and should include a greater focus on raising the quality of teaching and learning. A lack of clarity in relation to governance and management roles and responsibilities in the centre indicated that the need for self review in these key areas of centre operation.</p><p>ERO noted that teachers&rsquo; planning for individual children should be strengthened. The extension programme for the children over four years of age was teacher-directed and did not support the development of children&rsquo;s more complex thinking and social skills. However, ERO noted the competent and respectful modelling of good teaching practices by the supervisors and suggested that their example should be used to promote good teaching practice across teaching teams.</p><p>ERO suggested that a drive to recruit parents on to the Trust could result in greater availability of parents with relevant expertise to help govern and manage the centre.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>Following the 2012 ERO report, the supervisor developed an action plan to identify and initiate improvements needed in teaching and learning for children. The centre continues to work with some teachers for whom New Zealand teaching practices are not yet well understood.</p><p>Staff communication was identified as a priority to enable the teachers to work as a team. The majority of teachers come from diverse cultural backgrounds and have first languages other than English. A workshop on team building has encouraged a more cohesive team approach to teaching and learning. While team spirit and a sense of ownership amongst teachers is still in the early stages of development, a good start has been made. Children benefit from the care and attention of most teachers.</p><p>All teachers have had significant professional development opportunities to help them to observe and identify children&rsquo;s learning and strengthen their teaching practices. Staff meetings are now more clearly focused on identifying ways of supporting individual children&rsquo;s interests through programme planning. Non-contact time to document programme planning and assessment records is generally regular.</p><p>Portfolios show genuine progress in recording individual children&rsquo;s development over time. Some teachers now recognise the value in reflecting on ways to support children by using the information they have recorded in portfolios. A new evaluation page included in portfolios is a positive way of informing parents about their children&rsquo;s learning and development. Links between learning stories and programme planning are beginning to be clearly identified, and definite progress has been made.</p><p>Teachers cater well for the learning needs of the predominantly young group of children by providing them with appropriate challenges and opportunities. Children are able to take safe risks in their learning, particularly outdoors. These opportunities are clearly recorded in children&rsquo;s portfolios.</p><p>After the 2012 ERO review, Trust members began to plan significant changes to separate governance from management, including identifying stronger leadership roles for supervisors. A strategic plan has been developed and annual planning guides the day to day operation of the centre. All job descriptions and contracts have been redeveloped to make Trust expectations clear for teachers.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>Members of the Trust and the centre supervisor agree that their next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to support teachers to improve their practice, both in programme planning and teaching</li>
<li>use self-review processes to judge the effectiveness of programmes in providing positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>develop teachers&rsquo; understanding and ownership of agreed teaching practices</li>
<li>continue the separation of governance and management and monitor the impact of this on the quality of children&rsquo;s education and care.</li>
