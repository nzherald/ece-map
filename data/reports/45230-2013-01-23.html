<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span style="font-size: 1.17em;">1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The service is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. Teachers take good care of children and are interested in promoting their learning. Stronger professional leadership should continue to build staff capacity and support sustained improvement.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Junior Junction (Albany) is licensed for eighty children, including up to twenty-five aged up to two years. The centre has an infant area, an area for toddlers, and a pre-school area for older children. Each area has a head teacher and the centre has an overall manager who works three days a week. There are sixteen teachers altogether, eleven of whom hold early childhood education qualifications. The head teachers have teaching as well as curriculum and team leadership responsibilities.</p><p>The centre opened in November 2009 and this is its first ERO review. The centre manager has been pivotal in leading staff successfully through the centre&rsquo;s early years of development.</p><p>Junior Junction (Albany) is one of six centres operated by the same owners. The owners and the organisation&rsquo;s operations manager provide the centre manager with support in property, administration and personnel management.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Parents are welcomed warmly into the centre. Positive relationships support their partnership with centre staff. Children play peaceably together and follow centre routines well. Teachers use primary caregiver/wh&#257;nau group approaches to provide focused adult attention for children. They carefully transition children into the centre and into new teaching spaces as the children grow older. Inclusive and collaborative centre leadership supports positive relationships within the centre.</p><p>Children are settled and seem happy and secure in the centre. They receive good levels of appropriately implemented care. Infants are provided with resources within their reach, and are encouraged to move freely on the carpeted area. Other children select materials freely and make decisions about their play. M&#257;ori and Pacific children participate successfully in centre programmes and children with additional needs are well catered for. The children are confident learners who demonstrate a readiness to engage in complex and challenging play. Teachers should now focus on promoting and more purposefully developing such play.</p><p>The centre has strengths in its leadership. Centre leaders engage in some very useful self review to promote programme improvement. Centre management and leadership procedures are formalised and well documented. The centre manager and head teachers have a commitment towards further strengthening leadership and teaching programmes. Their plan to participate in and support professional development in M&#257;ori language and culture in 2013 should help teachers to better reflect New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage in centre programmes and operations.</p><p>The centre manager values the support she receives from the owners and the operations manager. However, the owners should now consider how they could:</p><ul>
<li>provide stronger mentoring, coaching and professional development for teachers on best practices in early childhood education</li>
<li>provide training for managers and head teachers in their professional leadership roles, and prioritise these roles in their job and task descriptions and their non-teaching time allocations</li>
<li>develop a more suitable appraisal system for non-qualified and non-registered teaching staff</li>
<li>review the centre&rsquo;s complaints procedures.</li>
</ul><p>The quality of the educational programmes provided for children could be strengthened considerably. ERO and the centre manager agree that actions to support improvements include:</p><ul>
<li>ensuring that all centre practices reflect the centre&rsquo;s philosophy, mission statement and best practice in early childhood education</li>
<li>providing improved and more challenging outdoor play activities</li>
<li>planning more child-centred, creative and challenging learning activities that are based on children&rsquo;s strengths and interests</li>
<li>having more extensive, rich and regular conversations with children.</li>
</ul><p>Improved practices in programme planning, implementation and evaluation should also help improve the quality of education provided for children.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Junior Junction Albany completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO recommends that centre leaders review the wording and implementation of the centre&rsquo;s child behaviour management practices. All practices should include positive guidance that encourages children&rsquo;s social competence. They should fully support the rights of children to a warm, safe environment in which their needs are understood by adults and are deemed to be of the highest importance.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>23 January 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
