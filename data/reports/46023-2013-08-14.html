</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waterview Kindergarten is a well established provider of preschool education. It moved to a new building adjacent to Waterview Primary School at the end of 2012. At that time the kindergarten also changed from a sessional to a full day model. This change resulted in increased staffing and contributed to a change in centre philosophy and teaching approaches.</p><p>The kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA). The association provides policy, procedural and operating guidelines. It also provides teachers with regular, topical professional development and on-going support from professional managers.</p><p>The kindergarten serves a culturally diverse community with many migrant families. Since the 2010 ERO report staff have been encouraging greater whānau/ family involvement in the kindergarten’s programme.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle well into the kindergarten and high quality transition practices support children entering and leaving for primary school. Children have a strong sense of belonging to the kindergarten. They engage well in the programme and enjoy sustained cooperative play. They are socially competent learners who are confident and curious.</p><p>Good relationships at all levels are valued as a foundation for positive learning. Teachers’ conversations and interactions with children are positive and responsive. Parents are welcome to stay during the day and participate in the learning.</p><p>Teachers promote an inclusive and respectful environment. With the support of the community, teachers are developing bicultural practices that enhance children’s learning about Aotearoa New Zealand. Children of Māori descent are supported to achieve success through affirmation of their cultural heritage. Pacific cultures are well recognised, and teachers are continuing to build their cultural competence to better support children of all ethnicities and their families.</p><p>Teachers provide a good quality programme underpinned by a very well resourced environment and effective planning systems. Plans are based on a reflective daily meeting where teachers discuss the emerging interests of children as basis for programme development. Teachers integrate literacy and numeracy into children’s play in a purposeful way. Whānau are encouraged to have a strong voice in children’s learning portfolios.</p><p>Teachers use good systems for self review that focus on a continuous cycle of improvement. Professional development and support for new and beginning teachers is well managed. The kindergarten’s strategic direction is currently focused on children settling into the new premises and environment.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Kindergarten teachers, the association manager and ERO are in agreement that:</p><p>children’s portfolios could be better used to show their progress over time by more clearly documenting links between learning stories</p><p>while meeting requirements, further development of the outdoor environment would increase physical challenge for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waterview Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Waterview Kindergarten will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>14 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
