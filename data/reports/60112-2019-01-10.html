</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>BestStart Pharazyn Street Kindy, formerly Melling Community Kindy, is licensed for 40 children from two to five years of age. It offers sessional and fulltime enrolments. The centre is owned and operated by Best Start Educare Limited, that owns early childhood services across New Zealand.</p><p>The philosophy promotes respecting home languages, celebrating diversity, encouraging curiosity, self-discovery and success. The ‘bucket filling’ philosophy is underpinned by virtues of respect, responsibility, kindness and caring, listening, cooperation and manners and courtesy.</p><p>At the time of this review 51 children were enrolled, with six Māori and four of Pacific heritage. The kindergarten serves a culturally diverse community.</p><p>Since the February 2016 Education report, significant changes to staffing have occurred, including a newly appointed centre manager and head teacher. The previous ERO report identified key next steps for improvement. These included: developing leadership; creating a positive team culture; strengthening of appraisal; establishing a shared understanding of effective teaching and learning; providing a responsive curriculum with an emphasis on bicultural and multicultural perspectives; and strengthening the use of internal evaluation. Progress in addressing these areas is ongoing.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in a play-based programme that supports their emerging interests. Independent and small group play is fostered through activities that engage and support investigation, exploration, gaining confidence and having fun.</p><p>The learning environment is calm and unhurried. Teachers are affirming and positive. Relationships between teachers and children are respectful. Younger children have opportunities to play and learn alongside their peers, tuakana teina is evident.</p><p>Children with additional needs and their families are well supported. Additional provision enables equitable access to learning.</p><p>The centre philosophy is currently under review. This process should include identifying priorities for children's learning, in consultation with parents and whānau. These should align to <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum and reflect what education success looks like for Māori and Pacific children and their families.</p><p>Aspects of kaupapa Māori are evident in the learning environment. Leaders have identified that the bicultural programme and practice needs strengthening. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>building teachers' capability so they can effectively respond to Māori children and their whānau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitoring the expectation for all teachers to use te reo me ngā tikanga Māori in everyday practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a curriculum that celebrates places of significance for mana whenua.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>A recently implemented group planning framework, based on children’s emerging interests, has been introduced. This approach provides a shared direction for the programme and encourages teachers to consider and reflect on the intentional teaching strategies used and their impact on children's learning.</p><p>Learning profiles are a record of children's interests, friendships and engagement in the programme. Further development in this area is required and next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>developing specific goals for children drawing from parent and whānau aspirations</li>
<li>undertaking a deeper analysis to identify the actual learning taking place</li>
<li>more clearly identifying intentional teaching strategies to be used</li>
<li>maximising the opportunities to celebrate children’s cultures, languages and identities.</li>
</ul><p>An effective internal evaluation process, with clear expectations, is in place to guide practice. Leaders work collaboratively to build teachers' evaluative understanding. Key next steps to strengthen this process include more clearly defining indicators of high quality practice, related to the area under investigation. These should inform data gathering and support evaluation related to outcomes for children and teacher practice.</p><p>Well considered systems and processes developed by Best Start Educare Limited support teaching and learning. A sound appraisal system and professional learning and development opportunities support and grow teachers' capability. Teachers use an inquiry-based approach that is focused on improving practice. Leaders have a leadership goal within their inquiry aligned to strategic goals. Further developing the appraisal process to reflect <em>Tapasā</em>: <em>Cultural competencies for teachers of Pacific learners,</em> should support teachers to respond more effectively to the needs of Pacific learners.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, and professional leaders agree the key next steps are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the bicultural curriculum, including celebrating children’s culture, language and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation capability, to more effectively measure the impact of the programme on children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of BestStart Pharazyn Street Kindy completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of BestStart Pharazyn Street Kindy will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>10 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
