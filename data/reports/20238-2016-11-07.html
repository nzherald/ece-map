</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Palms preschool is a small privately owned centre on Auckland’s north shore. It operates from a remodelled house and provides education and care for children from three months to five years old. The centre occupies well-maintained premises in which nutritious meals are prepared by the centre’s cook for children.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report commented on the positive and relationships among teachers, children and families. The centre has responded very well to the 2013 ERO report. Teachers have continued to develop their understanding of bicultural practice and make improvements to the learning environment. While there have been some staff changes the leadership of the centre has remained constant.</p><p>The centre philosophy embraces <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and integrates aspects of Reggio Emilia philosophy in the programme. Teachers share the centre philosophy that includes promoting discovery, respect and enthusiasm for learning.</p><p>The owner of the centre resides overseas. The centre's licensee and managing director support the centre manager with the day-to-day programme and centre operation. Systems and procedures are developed and monitored by the managing director, who provides professional advice and training as needed. In addition all governance, management, finance and personnel decisions are made by the managing director who keeps the owner periodically updated on business matters.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn in an exciting and inviting learning environment that promotes exploration, investigation, innovation and hands on learning. The centre is welcoming to adults and children. Well resourced play areas invite and sustain children’s engagement in play. Wall displays and equipment reflect teachers’ respect for te ao Māori and children’s family backgrounds. Teachers foster children’s understanding of science, particularly the around the natural world. This is reflected in the way children use and are physically active in the attractively landscaped outdoor area.</p><p>Children are capable eager learners who engage in sustained play. They have fun and their natural curiosity is encouraged, as is their ability to share ideas and problem solve. They are confident communicators, some in more than one language and experience success as a learner. They are creative, imaginative and use literacy, and mathematics as part of their play. The use of digital technologies as tools to document learning is highly evident in programme documents and teacher practice.</p><p>Teachers provide challenging learning experiences that foster children’s development as competent and confident learners. Their respectful and skilful interactions build on children’s ideas, language and interests in play and discussion. Teachers are culturally responsive and inclusive, fostering a strong sense of belonging in all children. They recognise and build on children's strengths.</p><p>The high value placed on children learning through play is evident in teacher practice and centre documents. The curriculum is responsive to children’s interests and strengths as well as parent aspirations. Teachers value children's ideas and follow their lead. They provide very good support for oral language development and encourage children to use their own home languages. Teachers are continuing to strengthening their use of te reo and tikanga Māori.</p><p>Children’s portfolios are highly valued, include their input and are often added to by families. The introduction of online communication has increased opportunities for parents and whānau to contribute to their children’s learning. There is good support for children's transition to school. Teachers are aware that strengthening partnerships with parents contributes positively to outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers are enthusiastic and work collaboratively. There is a culture of trust and respect fostered by the open communication. Teachers benefit from the managing director's and the centre manager's strong professional leadership. The centre manager supports teachers, is aware of their strengths, and encourages their leadership abilities. The managing director has a strategic approach to staff recruitment and retention. Self-review processes are well established and influencing decision making. Teachers could develop a stronger culture of continuous improvement through internal evaluation that is supported by relevant research and professional development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders and ERO agree that teachers could continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increase the depth and evaluative nature of long term self review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen strategic planning to show a clear alignment between self review, staff appraisal and annual plans, and their impact on children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop appraisal to meet the Education Council requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen parent partnerships in learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Palms Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Palms Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>7 November 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
