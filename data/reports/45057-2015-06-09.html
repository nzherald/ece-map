</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bell Street Early Learning Centre is a privately owned early childhood service in Featherston. It is licensed for 23 children including up to eight up to two year olds. There are 37 children on the roll Full time care and education is offered in a mixed aged setting. Many children attend the centre part time.</p><p>The service, which opened in 2009, is led by the supervisor and assistant supervisor. Most teachers are qualified and two are currently working towards their teaching qualification.</p><p>The philosophy of the centre highlights a child-led curriculum with an emphasis on respectful and responsive relationships and the promotion of children’s wellbeing and self-management skills. It strongly reflects the principles and strands of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The premises and spacious outdoor area were purposefully chosen and developed to give the feel of a family home. A suitable environment for outdoor learning and exploration is provided.</p><p>Supervisors and teachers have responded well to the areas for development identified in the July 2012 ERO report. They have focused their professional learning and development on assessment, programme planning, self review, appraisal and strategic planning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in a child-centred, play-based programme. Teachers and children have fun together as they engage in play and learning. Children, including those up to two years, can access a range of equipment, spaces and resources as they make choices about their learning.</p><p>Positive, caring and responsive relationships are a key feature of this centre. Interactions between teachers and children are warm, nurturing and respectful. Children are confident, happy, and display a sense of belonging. Parents and families are made to feel welcome and teachers develop strong partnerships with them to support children’s learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Children are empowered to take responsibility for the care of themselves, others and the environment. The curriculum places an emphasis on the development of skills and behaviours appropriate for transition to school. Children’s social competence and self-help skills are promoted well. Teachers have identified they plan to continue to develop processes and relationships with local schools to support children’s successful transitions.</p><p>Teachers have reviewed and improved systems for the communication of programme planning. They regularly complete digital learning stories about children. These provide attractive records of children’s learning activities that can be shared with whānau. The quality and depth of many of these assessment records has improved as a result of reflection and recent professional development. Families often contribute feedback about the stories. Teachers should continue to strengthen assessment practice by ensuring records:</p><p>captures the progression and extension of children’s learning over time</p><p>celebrates children’s cultural diversity.</p><p>Te reo Māori and aspects of tikanga Māori are incorporated throughout the curriculum. Māori values of manaakitanga and whanaungatanga are reflected strongly within the centre. A tuakana teina approach to learning is promoted. Older children have opportunities for leadership and to care for younger children.</p><p>The centre has begun to make connections with representatives of Ngāti Kahungunu ki Wairarapa. Managers and ERO agree that teachers should continue to develop their knowledge about local tikanga and their confidence and skill with te reo Māori so they can strengthen the reflection of te ao Māori throughout the curriculum.</p><p>A clear vision sets the direction for the service. Managers ensure the centre philosophy and vision are linked to a clear and useful strategic plan.</p><p>A systematic process of self review is evident. This approach is improvement focused, informed by research and considers a range of perspectives. Recent reviews have led to useful developments and improved systems. A next step is to strengthen self review so that it has a strong focus on evaluating the quality of curriculum, teaching and learning.</p><p>Managers have led a review and development of the appraisal process for teachers. The new model encourages teachers to be reflective and initiate their own professional learning. There is a sound process to support provisionally registered teachers. The inclusion of more evidence-based critical feedback about teaching is likely to improve the appraisal process further.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers and ERO agree the next steps for improvement are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen self review and evaluation with a focus on learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>continue to develop assessment processes.</li>
</ul><p>ERO and managers discussed ways in which a stronger focus on teaching and learning could be made more explicit in processes for evaluation and decision-making, such as self review, appraisal and annual planning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bell Street Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>9 June 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
