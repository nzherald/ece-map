</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Ohope Beach Montessori Preschool is a privately owned education and care service for children from two years to school age. The centre operates a full day programme five days per week, and many children attend on a part-time basis. The centre is licensed for 30 children. Its roll of 36 includes 4 children of M&#257;ori descent. The centre owner and licensee is the manager and professional leader of the centre.</p>
<p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy makes a commitment to providing a stimulating, creative, challenging, varied and fun learning environment for children. It reflects the intent of both the Montessori and <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p>
<p>A special feature of the centre is the outdoor play area which is located in expansive gardens that feature many fruit trees and reflects New Zealand&rsquo;s natural environment.</p>
<p>Since the 2012 ERO review, there has been only one change in the teaching team. Teachers have undertaken significant professional learning and development in the Montessori curriculum, transitioning to school processes, and the inclusion of science in the programme.</p>
<p>The centre was opened in 2010 and the 2012 ERO review identified that the centre provided high-quality education and care for children. This ERO review found that this quality of education and care continues to permeate throughout the centre.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children benefit from participating in a calm and settled programme that is very responsive to their interests. They have access to high-quality learning resources including those that reflect the Montessori philosophy. Particular strengths of the programme experienced by children include:</p>
<ul><li>many opportunities for exploration to experience the natural world</li>
<li>frequent trips and visits into the local and wider-community</li>
<li>an effective focus on science learning and creative play</li>
<li>opportunities for children to experience safe physical challenge</li>
<li>the effective integration of literacy and mathematics learning.</li>
</ul><p>M&#257;ori children&rsquo;s sense of identity and belonging is enhanced through the natural inclusion of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori. Strong partnerships have been developed with local wh&#257;nau that includes visits to local marae.</p>
<p>Teachers have developed positive and useful relationships with the local school that support children&rsquo;s transitions. Children enjoy many opportunities to attend school events such as musical productions and end of year celebrations.</p>
<p>Strong and useful partnerships have been developed with parents. The programme is enhanced by parents being able to share their knowledge and expertise with children. Parents are well informed about their children&rsquo;s participation in the programme and current interests through being able to access their child&rsquo;s ePortfolio.</p>
<p>Teachers work very well together in the best interests of children and their families. Children benefit from teacher&rsquo;s respectful and caring relationships. Teachers implement effective strategies that support children&rsquo;s problem solving and thinking skills, and actively participate alongside children in extended play and learning experiences. Teachers are responsive to children&rsquo;s care needs and effectively promote children&rsquo;s self care and independence. ERO observed high levels of sustained and meaningful play by children, both independently and in small groups of their own choosing.</p>
<p>The centre manager provides effective professional leadership and governance for the centre. She is a very reflective leader and models high-quality teaching practice. The centre manager is highly respected by teachers and parents.</p>
<p>A useful policy structure has been developed to guide centre operations. The centre is generously resourced and funds extensive teacher professional development. Regular self review is contributing to ongoing centre development.</p>
<p>Ohope Beach Montessori Preschool continues to provide high-quality education and care for children.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>The key next step for the centre is to continue to develop and implement a robust teacher appraisal process including providing teachers with regular, documented feedback about their teaching practice.</p>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ohope Beach Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Ohope Beach Montessori Preschool will be in four years.</p>

<p>Dale Bailey Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p>
<p>10 June 2015</p>
<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO&rsquo;s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s overarching question for an early childhood education review is &lsquo;How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?&rsquo; ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices/PART-4-ERO-s-Framework-for-review-Nga-Pou-Here"> Ng&#257; Pou Here</a>:</p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou &#256;rahi</em> &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>M&#257;tauranga</em> &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p>
<h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
