<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Waihi Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Waihi Kindergarten is located in Waihi East and caters for children from two years to school age. This well-established kindergarten operates under the governance and management of Tauranga Region Kindergartens (TRK).</p><p>Since ERO&rsquo;s last review in 2010 there have been significant changes to kindergarten operations and practices. These changes include:</p><ul>
<li>diversification of opening hours, resulting in the provision of six hour sessions Monday to Thursday and a four hour morning session on Fridays. Within these times there is flexibility in response to family needs</li>
<li>improvements to the building, made possible by considerable contributions from the kindergarten committee, parents and wider community</li>
<li>teachers&rsquo; involvement in focused professional learning resulting in more effective assessment and planning processes.</li>
</ul><p>The teaching team consists of four qualified and registered teachers. The head teacher and two of the teachers have been working in the kindergarten for a number of years. Parents interviewed by ERO appreciate the stability and continuity these teachers provide. In addition extra staffing to support the participation of younger children in the Friday sessions is seen as beneficial to younger learners.</p><p>Teachers have developed a programme philosophy that places high value on relationships as the basis for developing children's emotional and social wellbeing. They emphasise the importance of creating safe, secure and consistent interactions as the foundation for children&rsquo;s learning through play and exploration.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in four early childhood education services within the TRK umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>The experienced, skilled and knowledgeable head teacher provides collaborative professional leadership. She is focused on fostering children&rsquo;s social and emotional competence. Her quiet determination inspires teachers and parents to contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. She shares leadership opportunities through encouraging teachers and parents to develop and share their strengths and interests to enrich children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Through its philosophy, strategic direction and policies, the association ensures that the kindergarten remains focused on improving outcomes for children. A respectful and reciprocal relationship between the association and kindergarten community is highly evident. The experienced senior teacher provides ongoing support, guidance, professional feedback and learning for the head teacher and her team.</p><p>Teachers interact in ways that affirm and include children as individuals, fostering caring and respectful relationships. They value and acknowledge the importance of parents as partners in their children&rsquo;s care and education. Teachers use a range of strategies that successfully engage children in play and conversations about their learning. They listen carefully to children, respond to their interests and encourage them to persist with difficulty, and experience enjoyment in their achievements.</p><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s participation in Poumaomao, a community-wide project to strengthen the partnership with M&#257;ori, has increased teachers&rsquo; knowledge and ability to enhance the presence and perspective of M&#257;ori in the kindergarten.</p><p>Teachers have worked hard on developing their curriculum and assessment practice. Learning outcomes for children have been identified, are aligned to the philosophy and are guiding the development of an emergent programme and assessment practice. Changes to the way that teachers document children&rsquo;s learning enables parents and children to be more actively involved in the assessment process. A feature of the Waihi Kindergarten curriculum is the meaningful connections that children make with the wider community and adjacent school. Children enjoy their time at kindergarten, develop close friendships and have the confidence to participate and contribute to the group.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>ERO, the association and kindergarten staff, agree on the following areas for ongoing development:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening strategic and annual planning to better inform ongoing kindergarten development. Such plans need to more closely reflect and take account of TRK's vision and strategic direction, kindergarten self review, community goals and aspirations, team goals, and intended learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>continued development of teachers&rsquo; knowledge and understanding of an emergent curriculum and their role in this approach to programme implementation.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waihi Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>25 January 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
