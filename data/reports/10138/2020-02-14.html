</table><p>Natural Steps Early Childhood Centre (Ellerslie Village) is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Natural Steps Early Childhood Centre (Ellerslie Village) operates in two adjacent, extensively renovated residential villas, with infants and toddlers in one villa and older children in the preschool villa. There is a large outdoor area at the rear of both villas. In 2019 the centre's licence was amended. It is now licensed for 65 children, including up to 25 children under two years of age. The centre caters for a culturally diverse community.</p><p>The centre is one of three services with the same ownership. The owner and regional manager are actively involved in the centre and support the manager with day-to-day management. Natural Steps in Ellerslie employs nine registered teachers, including three head teachers. Many teachers are longstanding staff in this centre.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy is aligned with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and its intent is for children to become lifelong learners. It is influenced by Reggio Emilia principles and values and the Emmi Pikler approach. The philosophy emphasises mutual respect, social responsibility and a strong partnership between children's homes and the centre.</p><p>The 2016 ERO review identified the need to increase the rigour of internal evaluation and strengthen teaching practices. It recommended a review of the time available for teachers' documentation and reflection. As a result of professional learning and development for teachers, there have been positive shifts in teaching practices since 2016. The requirement to align policies and procedures with the requirements of the Children's Act 2014 has been addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and happy. They work well together in sustained play. Friendships are established through tuakana/teina relationships. Teachers implement inclusive practices that enable children with additional learning needs to participate in the programme. Children have a strong sense of belonging in the centre.</p><p>Children choose their own activities and interests from a range of resources in playrooms and the outside areas. Their prior knowledge is recognised in the prepared learning environments. These surroundings promote children’s exploration and collaboration alongside teachers who provide responsive support for play. Literacy and mathematics are included as part of children's activities. A focus on art is a particular feature of the environment.</p><p>Teachers promote responsive relationships and provide consistently nurturing and positive care for infants and toddlers. They respond to children’s cues and preferences and maintain a calm, slow pace in the programme. The environment is thoughtfully arranged for these younger children.</p><p>Transitions within the service and on to school are well managed. Close communication has been established with the local school. To support continuity of learning when children transition, their achievements and development are celebrated and documented to share with whānau and their new school.</p><p>Te ao Māori is valued and reflected through resources, displays, waiata and tikanga. Children’s individual pieces of Māori and Pacific art are displayed. Their individual cultures are celebrated throughout the year.</p><p>Teachers have established strong relationships with families and the community. Assessment portfolios provide parents with an insight into their children’s learning progress and development. Teachers acknowledge and use children's interests and parents' aspirations to inform assessment and planning. The use of an online communication platform and additional ways of communicating, encourages feedback from parents and whānau.</p><p>Leaders and teachers promote a culture of continuous learning and ongoing improvement. A wide variety of professional development has included intentional teaching, promoting social competence, and the integration and use of flexible resources. Internal evaluation and performance appraisal have also been areas for professional development. There is a clear understanding of the role of internal evaluation in the improvement process.</p><p>Centre operations are guided by strategic and annual plans and regularly reviewed policies and procedures. Staff and whānau have opportunities to contribute to review processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps are to continue:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening assessment, planning and evaluation to promote positive learning outcomes for individual children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building bicultural practices to support children's familiarity with local Māori history and the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Natural Steps Early Childhood Centre (Ellerslie Village) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>14 February 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
