<a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Background</span></h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Fetu'u Moana Catholic Early Childhood Preschool governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the September 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>improvements to the quality of teaching practices, programme implementation and curriculum planning</li>
<li>the extent to which centre managers have improved management practices and self-review processes</li>
<li>the extent to which centre managers have addressed issues of non-compliance identified in the 2012 report</li>
<li>any other issues relevant to the governance, management and operation of the centre that arise in the course of the review.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Fetu’u Moana Catholic Early Childhood Preschool offers education and care for 30 children up to 5 years old, including up to 5 infants and toddlers under 2 years old. The service is governed by the Tongan Catholic Chaplaincy which operates in Papatoetoe, Auckland.</p><p>The centre is committed to integrating the Tongan culture, language, identity and Catholic values with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. A management board which consists of church and parent representatives meets regularly to discuss the governance and management of the centre.</p><p>This is the centre’s fourth ERO supplementary review. Since the 2012 ERO review staff and managers have made a concerted effort to improve practice and respond to the issues raised in the previous report, especially in health and safety areas.</p><h3>Review findings</h3><p>ERO notes the following areas of progress since the September 2012 ERO report.</p><p>There has been an improvement in staff morale at the centre. Centre management have developed systems for teachers to raise matters and voice concerns. Teachers are now better able to contribute to centre decision-making through this process. Improved team work is becoming apparent.</p><p>The supervisor, staff and board have begun to develop strategic and annual plans. This has the potential to help centre management focus on future priorities rather than day-to-day management.</p><p>Changes to budgeting have provided teachers with greater opportunity to meet the curriculum needs of children in the programme. Teachers can now resource the programme with relevant equipment and resources that reflect children’s interests.</p><p>The September 2012 ERO report noted actions required for compliance around earthquake drills, trip hazards and police vetting. The centre management board have ensured that areas of non-compliance identified in the 2012 ERO report have been addressed.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>Some steps have been taken to improve aspects of the curriculum. As a result of professional development, teachers have developed some systems for planning the programme. There are some good examples of learning documented in children’s portfolios. In order to improve upon these basic practices, teachers need to be guided by a knowledgeable curriculum leader.</p><p>Teachers need to have a shared understanding and expectation that children will respond in the Tongan language where possible. More effective language strategies would help to increase teachers’ and children’s use of the Tongan language.</p><p>Some teachers are able to promote children’s learning and development well. All staff need to develop strategies to promote children’s knowledge and skills through play. Building on what children know, and what they want to know and want to find out will help teachers create more meaningful contexts for sustained conversation and learning through play.</p><p>The layout of the centre environment for children needs improvement. Centre managers and teachers should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>the area designated for babies and toddlers meets children’s developmental needs and provides a secure space for them.</li>
<li>they create designated areas for play to encourage children to explore, sustain their interests and develop a sense of responsibility for their environment</li>
<li>the outdoor playground is appealing to children and promotes their physical development.</li>
</ul><p>Staff need to ensure that there is ongoing review of centre processes and systems so that they are continually improving outcomes for children at the centre. Teachers need to develop a shared understanding of the process and purpose of well documented self review and be more effective in identifying areas that need improving.</p><p>Centre managers should ensure that annual and strategic plans clearly document the overall goals and the actions to achieve these. They also need to ensure that parents have contributed to the strategic vision and direction of the centre.</p><a id="3-recommendation-to-other-agencies" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Recommendation to other agencies</h2><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps outlined in this report.</p><a id="4-actions-required-for-compliance" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Actions Required for Compliance</h2><p>During the review ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum and self review. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas by:</p><ul>
<li>providing education and care that demonstrates an understanding of children’s learning and development, and knowledge of relevant theories and practice in early childhood education</li>
<li>implementing an on-going process of self-review to improve the quality of education and care. <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008:</em> C4,GMA6.]</li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO intends to return to the centre within 2 years to evaluate the progress made in response to the recommendations in this report.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>2 April 2014</p><a id="information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Service</h2><table>
