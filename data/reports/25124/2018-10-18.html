</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Airport Lollipops Educare is licensed for 125 children, including up to 40 aged under two years. Children and families come from diverse cultural backgrounds. Māori children make up 10 percent of the roll, 32 percent have Pacific heritage and 10 percent are Indian.</p><p>Infants and toddlers have separate indoor and outdoor play spaces. Two rooms for older children share an outdoor area. The manager and four head teachers lead teaching teams that include seven qualified teachers, four teachers in training, and six unqualified staff.</p><p>The service's philosophy is strongly underpinned by whakawhanaungatanga and a belief that environments should be "inclusive, flexible, sustainable, caring and filled with aroha".</p><p>The 2015 ERO report affirmed the centre's flexible programme and representation of children's cultures. Good opportunities and space for infants and toddlers to engage in uninterrupted play were noted. These practices continue to be evident. Areas for development included programme planning, internal evaluation, and bicultural practices. A review of health and safety policies and procedures was also suggested. There has been some progress in these areas.</p><p>The centre is owned by the Evolve Education Group. Evolve provides an overarching governance and management framework and visiting personnel to support the operation of each centre. A recent re-branding of centres has occurred, with a view to building a greater sense of unity across the organisation. Initiatives that have been recently introduced are intended to improve staff stability in centres, promote effective internal evaluation and lift the quality of teaching practices.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews in the Evolve Education Group.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are articulate, friendly and confident, and choose to play with friends or on their own. Teachers' welcoming approach has supported the development of strong relationships with parents and whānau, many of whom contribute resources and ideas to the programme.</p><p>Teachers support children's learning and wellbeing by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>providing high teacher child ratios that foster trust and relationship building</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing a consistent teaching team for infants, toddlers and others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting smooth transitions for children as they move through the centre.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>They should now review how they can:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>involve children in taking greater responsibility for their immediate environments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use group times effectively to encourage children's involvement and promote child-led learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build effective partnerships with whānau, based on planning for children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are gaining confidence in using te reo Māori with children. They are committed to deepening their knowledge of Māori culture and strengthening their bicultural practices. Increasing the provision of multicultural resources would help to recognise and support the cultural identity of all children.</p><p>Teachers plan activities and resources in response to group interests and dispositions. Building on individual children's prior learning, ideas and theories in their planning would help teachers to provide a more responsive curriculum.</p><p>Leaders are embedding the use of a new appraisal system. Targeted professional development and individual mentoring approaches related to teachers' goals, will strengthen professional practice. To strengthen internal evaluation leaders and teachers should evaluate the impact of changes made on outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre is managed effectively. More consistent use of centre audits established by Evolve would help to implement policies, procedures and the curriculum. Centre leaders and teachers have begun to establish a strategic plan to guide the centre's development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager agrees that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing an annual plan to support the achievement of the centre's strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing and implementing a centre philosophy that aligns with <em>Te Whāriki 2017</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing the rigour of programme evaluation by critically examining how effectively teaching practices improve outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing deliberate teaching approaches to promote complex thinking and child-led learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Evolve Education Group managers agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring the company’s vision, values, philosophy, goals and systems reflect the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing clear strategic goals to inform improvement focused annual plans at regional, area and centre levels, that include <em>Te Whāriki 2017</em> and a strategy for supporting Pacific children and families</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing moderation and monitoring of the roles and responsibilities of personnel in positions of leadership, including centre managers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing monitoring of appraisal practices to ensure effective implementation is lifting teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how effectively levels of resourcing in centres support children’s learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Airport Lollipops Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Airport Lollipops Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>18 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
