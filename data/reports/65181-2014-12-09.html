</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Nanny Company Ltd (the company) is a family-owned service that provides education and care for children from birth to five years of age. Parents employ a nanny from the company to educate and care for their children at home.</p><p>Since the November 2011 ERO report, the management team have ensured that the good practices from the last review have been mostly sustained through the impact of the Canterbury earthquakes.</p><p>The service is made up of a number of Networks in Christchurch, Nelson, and Wellington. At the time of this review, there were no children enrolled in this network.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four home-based care services reviews in The Nanny Company Limited.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The findings in this report relate to the company and the work of the management team in promoting positive outcomes for children in all the schemes that they operate.</p><p>The service managers support nannies to foster close relationships with the children and their families. They help parents choose a nanny who is the best match for their family. Through ongoing visits to nannies and contact with families, the company promotes strong, responsive, respectful relationships between all parties to support children in their learning and care.</p><p>Visiting teachers support nannies to provide a curriculum based on everyday experiences. Activities such as baking, gardening and board games provide opportunities for children to learn about literacy, numeracy and science concepts. The company organise regular playgroups and outings to enrich the range of learning opportunities. These provide links to the community and build social support networks amongst children, their families and nannies.</p><p>The management team recognise and make good use of the strengths they have together. They foster positive constructive relationships within the company. Recently they have introduced a nanny awards ceremony to celebrate and share best practice. Peer assessments have been introduced to help the visiting teachers give each other valuable feedback, grow their leadership skills and ensure that The company's expectations are consistently met in each of the schemes. The owner and operations manager provide effective leadership and ongoing support to the visiting teachers.</p><p>The company is led by a cohesive management team who have strategically managed the service through a period of change. They have a future focus and continually look for ways to make improvements. This is evident in the way they:</p><ul>
<li>are guided by a clear shared vision and core values</li>
<li>have developed relevant planning to guide the company direction in the next two years</li>
<li>have effective systems for the daily operations of the company</li>
<li>make good use of self review to know how well they are meeting their own expectations</li>
<li>provide generous ongoing professional development for visiting teachers and nannies.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The management team have identified, and ERO's evaluation supports, the need to build on current good practice and strengthen outcomes for children. The company’s key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>enhance aspects of self review. This includes finding more ways to include parent views and aspirations in the self-review process and the review of the philosophy, policies and procedures</li>
<li>continue to provide opportunities for managers and visiting teachers to develop knowledge and understanding of te ao Māori. This will assist them to support the implementation of a curriculum that incorporates Māori perspectives</li>
<li>better show in guiding documents (vision, philosophy and curriculum policy) the services desired outcomes for children</li>
<li>strengthen the appraisal process by setting rigorous goals and gathering evidence of how the Registered Teacher Criteria are met.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Nanny Company South Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>The service provider ensures that nannies have relevant first aid qualifications and that once obtained these are kept current. To improve practice the service provider needs to ensure that nannies have a current first aid certificate prior to commencing work in the homes.<em>[Licensing criteria for home-based Education and Care Services 2008, HS22)</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Nanny Company South Limited will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>9 December 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework Ngā Pou Here:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
