</table><p>Rachel Reynolds Kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rachel Reynolds Kindergarten provides early childhood education for children|<span lang="mi">mokopuna</span> aged two years to school age. It is licensed for 45 children and currently has a roll of 30. It operates from 8.30am to 2.30pm Monday to Friday.</p><p>The valued priorities for children's learning, as reflected in the philosophy, are social and emotional competence, and communication and language skills. Teachers|<span lang="mi">kaiako</span> believe that to achieve these outcomes the principle value must be placed on people. Through:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><span lang="mi">wānanga</span>|communication, children can learn from others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span lang="mi">tangata whenua</span>|cultural locatedness, the kindergarten is a community where everyone can learn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span lang="mi">whanaungatanga</span>|relationships, everyone is welcomed and invited to contribute</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span lang="mi">manaakitanga</span>|integrity, equity and sincerity, everyone is respected</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span lang="mi">ako</span>|teaching and learning, children can succeed.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The teaching team has made very good progress in addressing the areas for development identified in the December 2015 ERO report. These included sharpening the focus, planning and visibility for children's oral language development. Valued learning priorities needed to be stated more clearly and aligned to strategic planning, internal evaluation, appraisal goals and professional development.</p><p>Rachel Reynolds Kindergarten is one of 24 kindergartens governed by Dunedin Kindergartens (DK). Day-to-day operations are led by a head teacher, who is new in the role since the kindergarten's last review. She works with two other qualified teachers and teacher aides. A senior teacher from DK provides support for professional and operational practice.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven DK kindergartens reviewed at the beginning of 2020.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The rights and autonomy of children are recognised and effectively supported. Children are purposefully engaged and cooperative as they play and learn. They communicate successfully and persevere with challenging tasks, negotiating and contributing meaningfully to routines. Older children show care for younger children, who confidently explore in the environment, secure in their relationships with their teachers. Children and their families develop a strong sense of belonging to the kindergarten.</p><p>Children's learning is enhanced through many effective teaching practices. These include respectful, flexible, intentional interactions with children. Planned practices draw children in and help them to feel included. Teachers consistently promote and support the identified curriculum priorities. They respect and deliberately foster child-led learning. Cultural identity, including that for Māori and Pacific children, is recognised, nurtured and celebrated. Children experience a caring, strengths-based approach to their learning and development.</p><p>There is personalised assessment, planning and evaluation for individual children. Parents' and whānau wishes for their children's learning are gathered regularly and purposefully responded to. Intentional teaching is evident in assessment, however this could be more specific in planning for some individual children. Assessment of children's learning shows their dispositions, reflects learning priorities and affirms their progress. Planning for groups of children responds to their interests and priority groups, including those of younger children. Teachers could consider exploring the impact of the bicultural plan for all learners, and specifically Māori learners and whānau. Overall a strong commitment to equity for all children forms the basis of decision making.</p><p>Children and their whānau benefit from a strong culture of care and respect. They experience genuine partnerships and dialogue that reflect the kindergarten's vision. Teachers sustain strong collaborative partnerships with whānau, agencies, community groups and the DK. Transitions for children into, and on from the kindergarten are well supported with useful communication and links.</p><p>Teachers and whānau work productively together. The philosophy was collaboratively developed with teachers, whānau and the community. The head teacher very effectively leads a team of highly committed teachers and teacher aides. Children are affirmed and nurtured for who they are and what they bring to their learning. Children with additional needs are very well provided for with specific strategies designed to enhance their learning and wellbeing. Teachers strongly advocate for, and support, whānau in their communication with specialist agencies. There is collective ownership and commitment to best outcomes.</p><p>Internal evaluation practice is valued and leads to improvements for children's learning. Teachers are highly reflective and responsive professionals. They make good use of purposeful professional learning to add rigour and depth to evaluations. The focus of evaluative activity consistently aligns with emergent or established curriculum priorities. Teachers' inquiries are meaningful and linked to teachers' experience, personal interest and what the kindergarten wants for its children. Teachers are open to learning to better support children and whānau.</p><p>The board of DK has made good progress in addressing the governance recommendations from ERO's 2015-2016 reviews. DK's mission and strategic priorities are well known and reflected in each kindergarten's strategic and annual plans. It has a sound policy and procedure framework that provides guidance for kindergartens and sound systems to monitor health and safety. Leaders and teachers benefit from relevant professional development and leadership support. DK actively supports equity of outcomes for all children by funding additional teaching resources to support children with additional needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next step for teachers is to refine some aspects of internal evaluation in relation to planning for priority groups and clearly answer evaluative questions posed.</p><p>The DK board has clearly identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps for DK to further improve outcomes for children are to ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>reporting and monitoring at all levels are evaluative, to clearly show how desired outcomes for children have been improved in relation to DK's and kindergartens' priorities for learning and other strategic priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a robust and systematic quality assurance framework is implemented to inform and monitor ongoing improvements in each kindergarten.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rachel Reynolds Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Southern)</p><p>Southern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Tini</span></p><p>22 May 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
