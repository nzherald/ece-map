</table><p>Campus Corner Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Campus Corner Early Learning Centre provides education and care for children from birth to school age. The current roll of 54 includes three children of Māori descent.</p><p>The centre has a long partnership with the Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology. It is governed by a board made up of parents and a staff representative. A new centre manager leads a team of qualified teachers and support staff.</p><p>Within the centre there are two defined areas including outdoor environments. One for infants and toddlers and another for young children. Each area has an assigned senior teacher.</p><p>April 2016 report identified areas requiring further development. These included strategic planning, and planning, assessment and self-review. Very good progress has been made in documenting assessment and systems for monitoring strategic planning. Other areas require further development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience care and learning in well-considered, age appropriate environments. Infants and toddlers enjoy positive, calm and nurturing conditions where attentive and inclusive learning supports them to develop and explore. They are stimulated through a range of well-resourced experiences that supports their independence.</p><p>Positive guidance strategies support children to explore and develop confidence. Teachers respond to learner needs and regularly engage with them to encourage choice that promotes their learning. Intentional teaching is highly evident in the centre. Positive primary care routines effectively engage learners.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are identified and effectively supported. Leaders and teachers work alongside their family and whānau to access external agencies when required.</p><p>Children's sense of belonging is nurtured alongside whānau during transition into, through and onto school. This is celebrated and valued through a well-considered and clear record of exploration and participation in learning. Documented progressions show how children develop their sense of belonging and confidence aligned to parent aspirations. Better evidence of cultural experiences in learning stories and celebrating children's language and identity in their learning journey is a key next step.</p><p>There is a commitment to bicultural practice and valuing all children’s language culture and identity through the delivery of <em>Te Whāriki</em> (2017), the early childhood curriculum. Strong rituals ensure Māori and all learners regularly experience centre kawa. Māori protocols and language are emphasised during whānau time, care and kai rituals. These are well known by children and are strongly led by key teachers. The annual Mātāriki event continues to be a valued celebration and an opportunity to engage with all whānau.</p><p>A new framework for planning for learning has been developed. It focuses on children’s emerging interests. Teachers notice, recognise and respond to children's interests and development to inform the programme and create meaningful learning experiences. Teachers should continue to draw on whānau aspirations to establish meaningful learning goals for children aligned to specific outcomes in <em>Te Whāriki</em> (2017).</p><p>Leaders show a strong commitment to the philosophy, goals and vision of the centre. New leadership is developing collaborative ways of working across the teaching team. It is timely to review the philosophy to define what learning matters. Engaging with whānau Māori and the Pacific community to define what educational success looks like for them should strengthen the responsiveness of the curriculum and bicultural practice.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are improvement focused. They continue to build their knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation to support decision-making. A key next step is to develop a collaborative approach to better evaluate the impact of teaching practice on learning outcomes.</p><p>A recently strengthened appraisal system has the potential to develop and grow teacher capabilities. Purposeful leadership and teacher goals align to centre and strategic priorities. Leaders should continue to build their knowledge of Māori language and Tapasā (Cultural Competencies Framework for Teachers of Pacific Learners) and clarify expectations for targeted, formal observations and bicultural practice. This should grow capability and strengthen consistency of practice.</p><p>Leaders have identified the need to develop purposeful learning partnerships with parents and whānau to enrich their contribution to their child’s learning. A recent parent survey has provided useful feedback for leaders and teachers. This has helped to inform ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO's evaluation confirms the team's identified areas for development. These are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>build the capability to use internal evaluation collaboratively as a tool for improvement</li>
<li>consult with parents, whānau Māori, and the Pacific community to determine what educational success looks like for them to better inform practice</li>
<li>extend and assess learning opportunities that celebrate bi culturalism and diversity</li>
<li>to build knowledge of Tapasā (Cultural Competencies Framework for Teachers of Pacific Learners) to inform clear expectations for practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Campus Corner Early Learning Centre Inc completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>9 September 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
