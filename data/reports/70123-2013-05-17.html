<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The service is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. The centre&rsquo;s leadership, management, and curriculum provide a strong direction for the ongoing successful development of the centre.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The centre uses its rural location to extend learning experiences and opportunities for children. The centre philosophy is strongly focused on children leading their learning and teachers finding ways to stimulate interests and develop strengths.</p><p>Parents and the community provide a high level of support to the centre. This supports the programme for children. The centre&rsquo;s increased involvement with other services and schools is contributing to a well-planned future direction for education in Tai Tapu.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO review, the centre has used the recommendations from the report and its own self review to improve what happens for children. This has resulted in significant improvements to the environment, relationships with the primary school, biculturalism and inquiry learning.</p><p>A notable feature of the centre&rsquo;s programme is the development of a very good transition-to-school process for children.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Positive, caring and respectful relationships across the centre contribute to children&rsquo;s sense of belonging and wellbeing. Teachers value parents&rsquo; contributions and make the time to meet and greet them on a daily basis. Children&rsquo;s learning is strengthened by teachers who know them very well and ensure that interactions are calm and unhurried.</p><p>Children with particular needs receive very good support from centre staff and external agencies. Teachers work closely with parents and keep them well informed about their progress. Staff regularly take part in professional development and reflective practices that focus on supporting and extending children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>The teachers use an effective primary caregiver system to meet the individual needs of infants and toddlers. They respond sensitively to their needs and maintain a very good focus on infants' language development. ERO observed that the centre philosophy is evident in the way small children are able to explore the environment freely and choose their own activities. Nursery teachers have developed a very effective programme to support children when they are ready to move into the preschool area.</p><p>Children have access to a wide range of learning activities that stimulate their curiosity and challenge them in their literacy and numeracy development. Children&rsquo;s interest in learning is also promoted in the very attractive and well-organised indoor and outdoor environments.</p><p>Teachers focus in planning on meeting individual needs and extending the interests and skills of individual children. Group planning is based on emerging interests and children&rsquo;s ideas and events in the community and beyond.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s learning and development is very well assessed and reported by teachers. These include daily programme evaluations, learning goals for every child that are reviewed on a regular basis, formal informative reports and learning interviews with parents.</p><p>Teachers are making good progress in the use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in the daily programme. The inclusion of aspects of the history and heritage of the local area in the curriculum would further strengthen children&rsquo;s sense of belonging and identity.</p><p>Senior leaders provide effective leadership and management in all aspects of the centre&rsquo;s organisation. There is a strong team culture amongst leaders and staff. Senior leaders make very good use of self review, appraisal and professional development to support ongoing improvements to teaching practice and learning for children. The director agrees with ERO that the use of peer and parent feedback would further improve the well-structured performance management system.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre has identified, and ERO agrees, that the next step to strengthen self review is to continue to link self review to all centre planning and programmes. This should include an evaluation of the impact of the recent merger of the nursery and preschool on meeting children&rsquo;s needs.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Monkeys &amp; Munchkins Preschool and Nursery completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>17 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues.
