</table><p>Halswell Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Halswell Preschool is one of two small, family-owned early childhood education and care centres. Both centres operate under the same governance, management and administration structure. Halswell Preschool is licensed for 26 children, including up to eight under the age of two. It has two separate areas to cater for the specific needs of infants and toddlers, and for older children up to school age.</p><p>A centre manager works closely with the owner to oversee the day-to-day operation of the service. All teachers are fully qualified. Leaders have maintained the positive aspects of the service identified in the 2016 ERO report while also developing internal evaluation, assessment, bicultural and teaching practices. Professional links to the local community include involvement in Waimariri-iwi Kāhui Ako.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy places emphasis on the development of supportive relationships amongst children and adults. It includes a commitment to Te Whāriki, the early childhood curriculum, and expresses a child-centred approach that promotes fun, challenge and children’s wellbeing.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy and valued outcomes for children are clearly evident in practice. Children are at the heart of all decision making. Each child is seen as a learner in the context of family and culture. The home language, culture and identity of families are acknowledged and valued.</p><p>Leaders and teachers actively foster positive, reciprocal relationships and inclusive practices. They promote partnerships in children’s learning with parents and whānau. Teachers value and make good use of parent voice and aspirations to plan for and support children’s learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively to provide a child-centred curriculum that is responsive to the individual interests, strengths and capabilities of children. Children are actively involved in a range of play-based learning experiences that promote their curiosity and creativity. They have many opportunities to explore and make their own discoveries within a natural outdoor environment.</p><p>Teachers work closely with children to help develop oral language, social skills and confidence as a learner. Emphasis is placed on improving bicultural practices and integrating te reo and tikanga Māori in ways that are meaningful for children and respectful of te ao Māori.</p><p>Children under two benefit from a calm and unhurried environment. Teacher interactions are caring and nurturing. Children are involved in routines in ways that are respectful of their preferences and aligned to home routines.</p><p>Parents are regularly informed of their children’s interests and learning through well written individual learning records. Personalised and supportive transitions into the centre, between areas within the centre and onto school help to develop a positive sense of belonging for children and families.</p><p>Leaders encourage a culture of critical reflection which leads to ongoing improvements to teaching and positive outcomes for children. Strategic priorities are aligned to annual goals, internal evaluation, appraisal processes and targeted professional development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified, and service leaders agreed, that priority should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening annual strategic planning to include a process of ongoing monitoring and evaluation of key annual priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>parent and whānau consultation on management documents and priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further development of appraisal processes to include formal observations of teacher practice and critical feedback and feedforward on identified goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>updating appraisal policy and procedures so that there are clear guidelines for appraisal and attestation processes, including observations, gathering evidence, and annual summary reports.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Centre leaders have identified, and ERO’s evaluation has confirmed, that other priority areas are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen all teachers' understanding and use of in-depth internal evaluation practices and processes which are focused on outcomes for children</li>
<li>further develop group programme planning across the centre and evaluate the impact of intentional teaching strategies on learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>continue to give prominence to bicultural perspectives and grow te ao Māori understandings and practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Halswell Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the on-site stage of the review ERO identified two areas of non-compliance. This included one late police vet and a piano that needed securing to ensure safety of children in the event of an earthquake.</p><p>The service must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>all renewal of police vets happen in a timely manner</li>
<li>heavy furniture is secured to ensure safety of children in the event of an earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>The centre owner responded with urgency to these concerns during the on-site stage of the review and provided ERO with evidence that these areas of non-compliance have been addressed.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Southern)</p><p><span>Southern Region - Te Tai Tini</span></p><p>15 January 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
