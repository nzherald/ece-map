The kindergarten currently operates morning sessions from Monday to Friday and three afternoon sessions each week. The long-serving and experienced teachers are fully qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten is well supported by the community. Teachers maintain good communication with parents/wh&#257;nau and local organisations in the interests of children. A weekly play group for younger children and an active parent group strengthen the links between the kindergarten and the wider community.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten philosophy, that includes a focus on providing an inclusive and nurturing environment for children and families, is easily seen.</p><p align="left">Children are confident learners who display a well-developed sense of belonging in the kindergarten. Teachers have high expectations for behaviour and use effective ways to support children in playing and learning together successfully.</p><p align="left">Children have good opportunities to learn about the natural environment and sustainable practices. The spacious and well-designed outdoor area provides children with many places to explore and apply their growing physical and social skills.</p><p align="left">Teachers know the children well. They now need to use this extensive knowledge more effectively to plan the programme and make ongoing assessments of children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers recognise that they need to find better ways to involve parents in children&rsquo;s assessments.</p><p align="left">Self review needs to be strengthened so that teachers have more reliable information about what is going well and where improvements could be made to the programme and teaching practices.</p><p align="left">Teachers have identified the need to provide more opportunities for children to use a variety of technologies to extend children&rsquo;s interests and learning.</p><p align="left">This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the kindergarten again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Beckenham was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergartens Beckenham.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
<li>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The kindergarten philosophy and vision reflect the uniqueness of each child. Teachers aim to provide a welcoming and inclusive learning environment in which children develop a sense of belonging, valuing and accepting their different social and cultural experiences. Teachers state that they focus on including parents and wh&#257;nau in children&rsquo;s learning to create a learning community. A key aspect of the vision is to make learning enjoyable.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4>Philosophy and vision in action</h4><p align="left">All aspects of the vision and philosophy are strongly evident in the programme. Teachers are inclusive and supportive of children. Teachers have a shared understanding of effective ways of working with children to capture their interests and engage them in learning. They work well as a team. Teachers regularly share information about children&rsquo;s efforts and celebrate children&rsquo;s successes.</p><h4>Children&rsquo;s sense of belonging</h4><p align="left">Children participate confidently and sustain interest in the programme for long periods of time. A weekly play group allows children to become familiar with the kindergarten environment before enrolment. The well-known routines provide children with security and the ability to make choices in the programme. Teachers have high expectations of children&rsquo;s behaviour and support them well in playing together successfully.</p><h4>Breadth of learning experiences and resources</h4><p align="left">Children have good opportunities to learn about all aspects of the curriculum. Literacy continues to be a strong feature of the programme. Construction and imaginative play are well resourced. Children are actively involved in these activities. The outdoor area provides a good range of physical challenges for children. Children are having increasing opportunities to learn and use te reo M&#257;ori. Teachers plan appropriate visits outside the kindergarten to extend children&rsquo;s interests and awareness of the wider world.</p><h4>Focus on environmental education</h4><p align="left">Children are benefiting from the emphasis teachers give to sustainable practices in the programme. Children have many and varied opportunities to learn about the natural world and care for animals. The spacious and well-designed outdoor area invites children&rsquo;s exploration and stimulates their curiosity.</p><h4>Community engagement</h4><p align="left">The kindergarten is supportive of and well supported by the community. Teachers foster positive and cooperative relationships with parents/wh&#257;nau and the wider community. Parents have good opportunities to share ideas and contribute to the programme. The regular involvement of parents/wh&#257;nau helps to extend children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers have established constructive relationships and communication with local schools to help make children&rsquo;s transition to school smoother.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><h4>Assessment, programme planning and evaluation</h4><p align="left">The teachers do not yet make sufficient use of their extensive knowledge of children&rsquo;s learning to plan the programme and show how they will extend this learning. Teachers now need to improve their documentation.</p><p align="left">In assessment by:</p><ul>
<li>identifying the practices they will use to build on individual children&rsquo;s prior learning more consistently</li>
<li>more clearly showing children&rsquo;s progress over time</li>
<li>increasing parents&rsquo; contributions to their child&rsquo;s profile.</li>
<li>In planning by:</li>
<li>showing how assessment information is used to plan for individual and groups of children</li>
<li>identifying what they want children to learn.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In evaluation by:</p><ul>
<li>recording how well children&rsquo;s learning has been extended as a result of the planned programme</li>
<li>giving more focus to the effectiveness of teaching practices and how these might be improved.</li>
</ul><h3>Extending children&rsquo;s use of technology</h3><p align="left">Teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that children should have more opportunities to use technologies in their learning. Currently, children make use of computers to find out about topics of interest. However, they are reliant on teachers to provide the resources and supervise their use. Increasing the range of resources should give children more regular access and encourage greater independence.</p><h3>Curriculum self review</h3><p align="left">Teachers need to make better use of the kindergarten&rsquo;s self-review processes to identify what is working well and where improvements could be made to the programme and practices. The review documentation should more clearly identify the kindergarten&rsquo;s long and short-term goals and action plans for achieving these goals. Teachers need to provide ongoing evidence to show how well the outcomes have been achieved. More specific indicators of success would assist teachers in evaluating the impact of reviews on outcomes for children.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long-term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of Children with Moderate to Severe Special Needs</h3><p align="left">As part of this review, ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3><p align="left">The established teaching team is experienced at working collaboratively with families and specialist services to support children with moderate to severe special education needs.</p><h3>Area of strength</h3><h4>Inclusive culture</h4><p align="left">Teachers provide an inclusive learning environment. They model inclusive practices and establish expectations that all children will be welcoming and supportive of one another. They foster positive and respectful working relationships with parents and wh&#257;nau. Collaborative partnerships with specialist agencies promote positive transitions and learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Area for review and development</h3><p align="left">These are covered in section 2 of this report.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Beckenham completed an ERO Centre Management Assurance Audit and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>

</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the kindergarten&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the course of the review, ERO identified one area of non-compliance.</p><ul>
<li>Excursion permission forms, signed by parents, did not include the ratio of teachers to children.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In order to address this concern, teachers must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>the parent or guardian of each child has given written approval to the ratio to be used.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Since the on-site stage of the review, the licensee has responded promptly to this area of non-compliance by reviewing practices in all kindergartens and making changes to the templates used to include ratios of teachers to children.</p><a id="6-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">6&nbsp;Recommendation</h2><p align="left">ERO and the centre managers agree that:</p><div>

</table><p>&nbsp;</p><a id="parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-beckenham" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Beckenham</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kidsfirst Kindergartens Beckenham.</p><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Beckenham is located in Christchurch. The kindergarten currently operates morning sessions from Monday to Friday and three afternoon sessions each week. The long-serving and experienced teachers are fully qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten is well supported by the community. Teachers maintain good communication with parents/wh&#257;nau and local organisations in the interests of children. A weekly play group for younger children and an active parent group strengthen the links between the kindergarten and the wider community.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten philosophy, that includes a focus on providing an inclusive and nurturing environment for children and families, is easily seen.</p><p align="left">Children are confident learners who display a well-developed sense of belonging in the kindergarten. Teachers have high expectations for behaviour and use effective ways to support children in playing and learning together successfully.</p><p align="left">Children have good opportunities to learn about the natural environment and sustainable practices. The spacious and well-designed outdoor area provides children with many places to explore and apply their growing physical and social skills.</p><p align="left">Teachers know the children well. They now need to use this extensive knowledge more effectively to plan the programme and make ongoing assessments of children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers recognise that they need to find better ways to involve parents in children&rsquo;s assessments.</p><p align="left">Self review needs to be strengthened so that teachers have more reliable information about what is going well and where improvements could be made to the programme and teaching practices.</p><p align="left">Teachers have identified the need to provide more opportunities for children to use a variety of technologies to extend children&rsquo;s interests and learning.</p><p align="left">This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association has been proactive in addressing these challenges.</p></html>
