<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The service is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Lollipops Educare is an education and care service that caters for infants, toddlers and pre-school children. It is located in purpose-built facilities in Te Rapa, Hamilton. The service is owned and operated by Lollipops Educare Group (LEG) that provides management support and professional oversight. Some indoor facilities have been upgraded to meet licensing requirements under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>.</p><p>The current centre director took up her position in July 2012. There have been several new staff and team leaders appointed in the past six months. Recent professional development has focused on strengthening communication and consultation amongst staff and families/wh&#257;nau. The staff team has worked together to review their philosophy for teaching based on the five main areas, as set out by Taina Phetu. The intent is to create a quality learning environment and promote best practice in early childhood education.</p><p>After a supplementary review in 2007, the previous ERO report in 2010 was positive and reflected considerable progress in operations and practice. The current roll includes 19 children who are identified as M&#257;ori. Several of the staff have well-established links with the local community and marae.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience warm and caring relationships with staff and each other. There is a settled atmosphere in the centre and staff use effective positive guidance strategies to encourage children&rsquo;s social skills such as persistence, conflict resolution, self regulation, confidence and responsibility. Routines are efficient and effective in promoting a sense of belonging and self management. The service works successfully with external agencies and families to include and support children with special learning and/or behavioural needs.</p><p>Teachers support children in their learning through the use of encouragement and thought-provoking questions. Younger children are able to observe and learn from the example of older children in a mixed-age environment.</p><p>Teachers meet regularly to share information from their observations of children&rsquo;s emerging interests. They plan to develop these interests and to make planning and learning more visible to children and families/wh&#257;nau through attractive wall displays. In addition, teachers have strengthened the recording of children&rsquo;s skills and learning dispositions through upgraded individual portfolios. These well-illustrated and presented documents are valued by children, who enjoy sharing their learning experiences with families/wh&#257;nau. Opportunities for creative learning are well integrated through the programme, including dance and imaginative play, and many aspects of early literacy.</p><p>Teachers are making a conscious effort to understand the aspirations of M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau and Pacific fono, who are made welcome in the centre, and encouraged to take an active interest in their child&rsquo;s learning. Symbolic of a new beginning, a local kaum&#257;tua recently blessed the centre. Te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori practices are naturally incorporated into daily programme and routines, and staff with appropriate skills and confidence lead weekly kapa haka for all children. A korowai cloak is now a significant part of the graduation ceremony when older children leave to go on to school.</p><p>Recent work has been done to improve the learning environments. The indoor areas for infants and toddlers incorporate natural, social, physical and material worlds, and are arranged to be safe and quiet, yet stimulating. The preschool inside play areas have been improved to increase children&rsquo;s access to most areas of learning, and their creative work is well displayed. Considerable challenges remain in the outdoor play areas to ensure children have a full range of opportunities for physical challenge, exploration and experiencing the natural world.</p><p>The centre director has been successful in establishing quality professional and personal relationships amongst staff, built on mutual respect and shared commitment to children and their families. She is well supported by the LEG centre support manager and is establishing an organisational culture based on continual improvement and development, which is clearly reflected in a detailed centre business plan. Self review is systematic and effective in identifying areas for further development. Leadership opportunities and organisational responsibilities are shared amongst staff in a collaborative manner. Staff goals are shared and consistent with developing systems of performance management and professional development. Sustained efforts have been made to increase two-way communication with families/wh&#257;nau, and a parent/teacher meeting has been held.</p><p>Centre leaders and staff acknowledge, and ERO agrees, that:</p><ul>
<li>aspects of the learning environments, especially outdoors, require significant further development</li>
<li>further review is needed to extend children&rsquo;s access and availability to quality resources in areas such as music, construction and in aspects of early mathematics.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Te Rapa completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>8 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
