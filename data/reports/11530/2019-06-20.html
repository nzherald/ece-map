</table><p>Ahipara Sandhoppers Early Childhood is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ahipara Sandhoppers Early Childhood is a well-established centre situated at Ahipara Primary School. It provides early childhood education and care for 60 children, including up to 20 aged under two years.</p><p>The centre provides for children in three separate spaces - infants and toddlers in Ngā Tipu, two and three year olds in Ngā Puāwai, and four year old children in Ngā Pūriri. Children from Ngā Tipu also have a separate outdoor space. All children share a spacious outdoor environment. Most of the children enrolled have Māori heritage.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is aligned with the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and aspects of the Resources for Infant Edu-carers (RIE) approach, a philosophy promoted by Magda Gerber. The philosophy emphasises building strong relationships with children and whānau, and supporting children's sense of mana whenua.</p><p>The centre is governed by a management committee. A sense of connectedness with the community includes associations with the school, OSCAR service and community playgroup.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified a calm, settled and inclusive tone throughout the centre, good support for children to develop positive social relationships, and evidence of tuakana/teina relationships. These positive features continue to be present. Areas for improvement in 2015 included evaluating the effectiveness of teachers’ practices, creating inviting discrete play areas, and strengthening curriculum leadership. There has been some progress in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and whānau are warmly welcomed. Children have many opportunities to explore and learn in the thoughtfully prepared, well-resourced, and carefully considered indoor and outdoor spaces. They play cooperatively with and alongside each other, often in mixed-age groups. They choose their own activities, make decisions, and negotiate with and involve others. Children confidently communicate both verbally and non-verbally with adults and peers.</p><p>Teachers prioritise building strong relationships with whānau. They know children well and foster children's sense of belonging and wellbeing. They skilfully support children to develop oral language and social skills. Children's preferences are respected. Teachers are highly responsive to children's cues, interests, dispositions and wonderings. They support children to investigate, explore, play and learn. Teachers working with infants and toddlers promote trust and the formation of secure attachments.</p><p>Teachers are inclusive and support all children well, including those with additional learning needs. Teachers incorporate kupu Māori naturally and confidently in conversations. Natural resources are valued and used in the centre.</p><p>Parents and whānau spoken with appreciate teacher's involvement with their children's lives and learning. The small parent committee is highly engaged in contributing to improvements at the centre. Families participate in centre activities enthusiastically.</p><p>Teaching practices are informed by <em>Te Whāriki</em> and current educational theories, and teachers continue to build their shared knowledge of implementing <em>Te Whāriki</em> (2017). Teachers collaboratively assess children's learning and identify their interests and dispositions.</p><p>Teachers agree that they could continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop their knowledge of children's identities as learners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>invite parents to contribute to assessments, strengthen their responses to parent aspirations, and make children's progress more visible.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers enact the centre philosophy well. Leaders and teachers work with staff to set high expectations for practice. Teachers and staff have access to professional learning and development (PLD) opportunities. Recent PLD relating to teachers' appraisal are beginning to strengthen the process. Internal evaluation is documented regularly.</p><p>The centre is effectively realising its vision. A strategic plan with an improvement focus has been developed. Leaders and teachers could prioritise supporting strategic goals with appropriate annual action plans. Annual planning, internal evaluation and appraisal goals can then be aligned with the strategic plan to achieve coherence across systems. Policies are reviewed regularly, and some policies must be updated to meet current requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further refining assessment and planning practices including how to plan for and extend children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening evaluative practices that focus on improving teaching practice and outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ahipara Sandhoppers Early Childhood completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found areas of non-compliance in the service relating to health and safety, governance and management. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>updating policies and procedures to meet current requirements for child protection , staff appointments, complaints, and excursions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>record keeping related to checks of sleeping children, excursions, illnesses, and administering medication</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>safety checking of all children’s workers who have access to children in accordance with the Children's Act 2014.</p>
</li>

ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
