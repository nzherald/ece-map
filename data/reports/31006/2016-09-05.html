</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pio Pio Playcentre is a parent-led centre located beside the local school. It provides education and care for children from birth to school age. The centre is licensed for 30 children, including a maximum of 10 children up to two years. At the time of this ERO review there were 19 children, including three who identify as Māori. There has been a significant increase in the roll since the previous ERO review.</p><p>The playcentre operates under the umbrella of the King Country Playcentre Association (KCPA) which is affiliated to the New Zealand Playcentre Federation (NZPF). The centre receives strategic direction and ongoing support and advice from a centre support worker (CSW) employed by the association.</p><p>The playcentre continues to be led and managed by parents committed to providing one morning session each week. Older children can attend a 'Big Kids' session on Wednesday mornings. These sessions are supported by an experienced supervisor.</p><p>Pio Pio Playcentre philosophy strongly prioritises helping parents to further develop their capacity to nurture and extend children's self-initiated play and learning. Parents are strengthening their understanding of their role as first teachers, through study courses provided by the association.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in 2013 the centre has effectively addressed the areas of assessment, planning and evaluation, and this has contributed to positive outcomes for all children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six playcentre reviews in the King Country Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from having positive learning interactions with interested adults. Parents take time to listen to children, extend their learning and foster oral language development. Children are given time to explore, and inquire into their own interests.</p><p>Literacy and numeracy are integrated through play. Children enjoy books being read to them and have opportunities to actively engage with story telling. Puzzles, construction equipment and cooking activities provide opportunities for developing early mathematical skills and problem solving. Te reo Māori is being included in the programme as parents build their knowledge and gain confidence in their daily use of te reo Māori.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor environments promote science concepts as children learn strategies for active investigation, thinking and reasoning. Children's wellbeing is supported through active play and the outdoor environment provides physical challenges for all age groups. Parents and children learn and play in a stimulating environment.</p><p>Infants and toddlers needs and rhythms are supported and nurtured by parents and other adults in a family-like environment. They are encouraged to be independent, through freedom of movement in an environment that is well resourced and invites curiosity and exploration. Infant, toddlers and young children learn and play together. This builds positive social skills and a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>Children visit the neighbouring school and participate in a range of events. These strong connections are effectively supporting children's transition to school.</p><p>The centre has established effective processes for self review. Review is focused on teaching and learning, and has led to more positive learning outcomes for children. The centre support worker, alongside centre members, has engaged in reviews focused on assessment, planning and evaluation. This has led to professional development with an external facilitator to build a shared understanding among parents.</p><p>There is now a structured approach to session evaluation and programme planning that responds to individual children's interests. Parents record their children's learning in individual portfolios that recognise their achievements, and documents their development and progress.</p><p>The centre support worker and parents have established an inclusive culture in which children are celebrated and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning. Parents are encouraged to take on roles and responsibilities, and emergent leadership is fostered and supported in a collaborative environment.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>The next step for the service is to undertake a review of the te ao Māori programme to identify areas that could further enhance children and parents learning and understanding of te ao Māori.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pio Pio Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pio Pio Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>5 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
