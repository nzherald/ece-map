</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Barnardos KidStart Childcare – Manurewa East Early Learning Centre operates under the umbrella of the Barnardos organisation which provides on-going management and professional support.</p><p>The centre operates in the grounds of the local primary school and caters for 50 children including 12 up to two years of age. The centre provides full day education and care for the local, diverse community. High numbers of children attending have Māori heritage.</p><p>The recent appointment of a new head teacher has prompted teachers to review and redevelop their philosophy statement in collaboration with whānau. It has also led to changes in the centre environment, particularly with arrangements of playing spaces and displays. The new teaching team comprises predominantly qualified teachers.</p><p>The 2012 ERO review of the centre was its first. The report describes strengths in the programme, and sound relationships with and respect for the cultural heritages of whānau. The report also noted that planning systems, self review and parent involvement were areas that could improve. Teachers were also encouraged to focus on implementing strategies to increase the complexity of children’s play. Teachers continue to address these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers warmly welcome children and their families at the start of their day. Children are quick to settle to play. They display a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing in their conversations with teachers and their friends. Families are comfortable and relaxed with teachers, sharing news from home and staying briefly to settle their children. It is obvious that teachers know children and their families well. Parents are beginning to contribute to programmes.</p><p>Teachers plan and provide programmes that effectively entice children to participate and make choices about their play. Resources are stored attractively and recent reorganisation has made more room for interesting displays to attract children. Children move freely between the indoor and outdoor areas. Teachers are careful about arranging activities to take advantage of shade.</p><p>Children are engaged in their play. The younger children are able to play, for the majority of the day, with their older siblings and friends. Teachers prompted support for the little ones’ learning by encouraging thoughtful tuakana teina relationships. Older children are careful and loving with the younger children.</p><p>Teacher use effective strategies to encourage children to think for themselves and to solve problems as part of their play. Most conversations with children are held down at their level and are one-to-one. Some teachers are also able to engage with children through use of their home languages. Children are articulate with teachers and their peers. There is still a need to continue to support children to elaborate and extend the complexity of their play.</p><p>Barnardos supports teachers to understand and acknowledge New Zealand’s bicultural heritage in their work with children and families. This is a strength in Barnardos - Manurewa East. Teachers all strive to include te reo Māori in their interactions and displays. Teachers recognise the importance of family heritage. Resources also include many with Māori themes or language. Displays and language also acknowledge the smaller number of Pacific Island and Indian children who attend.</p><p>Teachers have developed relationships with the school which is on site. This supports the sharing of information about children who will attend the school, and the programmes that support their development and learning in the centre. Teachers are planning an in-depth researched self review to support them to integrate literacy and numeracy in play. It will also focus on further enhancing children’s social competence and confidence as key steps for children’s easy transition to school.</p><p>Barnardos provide effective and ongoing support for teachers to improve practice and to strengthen teaching and learning programmes. Appraisal systems encourage teacher’s recognition of their responsibilities, as registered teachers, to maintain high standards of learning and teaching. Professional learning is provided as internal and external professional development. Administration and management are well organised, and systems are current. Despite several changes to leadership roles and positions, the centre remains efficient and sustainable.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers agree that key next steps for the centre are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>support teachers to engage in more professional discussions, evaluation and self review to help them identify their own professional needs and expectations about programmes</li>
<li>strengthen the complexity of play through conversations and questioning that encourages children to think and plan</li>
<li>continue to support diverse learners through language and communication development.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Manurewa East Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Manurewa East Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>30 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
