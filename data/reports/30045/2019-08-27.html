</table><p>Kainga Tamariki is not well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kainga Tamariki is in the rural township of Kihikihi, south of Te Awamutu. The long established centre is licenced to provide full-day education and care for children from birth to school age, including a maximum of eight infants aged up to two years. At the time of this review, approximately half of children enrolled are Māori.</p><p>It is a privately owned family business, operating under the management and governance of the owner. Since ERO’s previous evaluation in 2015 the centre manager/owner has employed an assistant manager. There have been considerable changes to the teaching team. In October 2018 the centre appointed a curriculum leader.</p><p>Centre operations, day-to-day management, and governance are the responsibility of the centre owner/manager. The service has been working with the Ministry of Education in 2019 to address areas of compliance.</p><p>The centre’s ERO reporting history shows that areas identified for improvement in 2013 and 2015 remain areas for improvement in this 2019 report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Kainga Tamariki Early Learning Centre is not well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. ERO identified significant areas of non-compliance with the Early Childhood Regulations and associated Licencing Criteria related to: curriculum; governance; management and administration; premises and facilities; and health and safety practices.</p><p>Managers/owners and teachers should urgently improve their knowledge, understanding, and implementation of regulatory requirements in relation to early childhood education provision.</p><p>Stronger leadership and governance is required to ensure existing systems and processes are adequately developed and implemented to support sustainability and meet requirements. Some of the centre's policies and procedures identified for review since 2015 have not been updated to reflect and meet current regulatory requirements.</p><p>Children are yet to experience a curriculum that suitably responds to their abilities, interests, and needs. Curriculum leaders and management need to strengthen their understanding of current teaching and assessment practices in line with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Internal evaluation for ongoing improvement is in the very early stages. Building the capacity of all personnel to understand the purpose and use of internal evaluation to inform future decision-making is required.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities for improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>systems for identification, monitoring and assurance of all legislative requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leadership to improve teachers' professional practice to promote high quality education and care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>curriculum responsiveness to better meet all children's strengths, abilities, interests and needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation and how this contributes to developing high quality practice and outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that the service is effectively governed and managed in accordance with good management practices, including review practices and full implementation of teacher appraisal processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kainga Tamariki completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas and ensure there is:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>an ongoing process of self-review and evaluation that helps the service maintain and improve quality of its education and care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a current operative Fire Evacuation Scheme approved by the New Zealand Fire Service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>safe securing of heavy furniture and equipment that could fall or topple and cause serious inquiry or damage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an appointment process that is consistent with the requirements of the Children's Act 2014</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all reasonable steps taken to ensure the premises and facilities are kept in good repair and maintained</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a suitable design and layout of the infant learning environment to support effective supervision of children and does not restrict access to the licensed space</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nappy changing facilities that are safe and stable and appropriate for the age and weight of children and safe and hygienic practices, particularly for older children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the elimination of any hazards to the safety of children, particularly plastic bags in the sleep room and unsecured electric cords</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>records related to each child who attends and sleeps at the service, and that these are consistently documented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an annual plan to guide the service's operation that is current and not only includes when key tasks are to be undertaken but also who is responsible, and that the plan is fully implemented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the full implementation of a teacher appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adults providing education and care and engage in meaningful positive interactions to enhance children's learning and development; and those adults demonstrate an understanding of children's learning and development, and knowledge of relevant theories and practice in early childhood education. <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6; HS4; HS6; GMA7; GMA 7A; HS28; HS1; PF13; HS17; HS18; PF25; HS3; HS12; HS9; GMA 8; GMA 9; C3; C4; Children's Act 2014]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the onsite stage of the review the service has provided ERO evidence of the following: annual planning; an appointment process consistent with the Children's Act 2014; the layout of the infant outdoor space to support effective supervision; and sleep records of each child who attends and sleeps while at the service, to address the identified areas of non-compliance.</p><p>In order to improve practice, managers need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen practices around the management of complaints received.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Kainga Tamariki. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>27 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
