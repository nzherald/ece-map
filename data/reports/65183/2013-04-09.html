<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The centre is well placed to provide high quality care and programmes that promote positive outcomes for children. Further development of self-review practices will enable the centre to continue to build on and sustain current improvements.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The centre is part of a number of Kindercare Learning Centres that operate throughout the country. The national organisation provides the centre with management and administration systems. An area manager works closely with staff to support programmes and practices that reflect the Kindercare philosophy.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO review, a new centre director has been appointed. There has been an increase in the size of the licence and the centre has made good progress in improving programmes for children.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Relationships between teachers and children are nurturing and strongly supportive of children&rsquo;s wellbeing and sense of belonging. Teachers know children very well and make sure that interactions with them are respectful, unhurried and calm.</p><p>Children are free to explore their own interests and activities for extended periods of time. Teachers are supportive of children&rsquo;s choices and work and play alongside them at their level. Children use and enjoy a good variety of resources for creative play. Teachers warmly welcome children into activities and engage with them at a pace that suits their needs and understanding. Children know the routines well and are supported with transitions between aspects of the programme.</p><p>Teachers use research to guide and support their teaching practices. They use a range of teaching strategies and provide stimulating and well-organised environments to support children&rsquo;s learning and creativity. The centre&rsquo;s values and philosophy of making sure that children are safe, loved and making good learning progress are very evident in teaching and learning relationships. Children benefit from regular discussions with teachers about things of interest to them.</p><p>Significant developments in centre programmes since the 2010 ERO review are strengthening links between the centre and children&rsquo;s homes. Parents are kept well informed about children&rsquo;s wellbeing and learning development. Other improvements include:</p><ul>
<li>the way the progress of infants and toddlers is recorded and shared with parents</li>
<li>the focus on children&rsquo;s learning attitudes and skills</li>
<li>the development of centre programmes based on children&rsquo;s interests and needs</li>
<li>the ongoing development of ways to effectively assess children&rsquo;s learning that include a good focus on literacy and numeracy.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have made some progress in their use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in the programme and in their interactions with children. ERO agrees that this should remain a focus for continued improvement.</p><p>Strong professional relationships are evident across the centre. Regular meetings between the area manager and centre director ensure that there are good links between the centre and the national organisation. The centre director provides effective leadership that is valued and respected by staff and is well supported by the area manager. The centre director also told ERO that a main strength of the centre is the way the staff work as a team to support and care for children.</p><p>The centre benefits from regular external audits of its operations and practices. Staff regularly review policies and take part in professional learning discussions and programmes that focus on continued improvements to children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The area manager and centre director should now evaluate the quality and impact of their self review systems and practices. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>making sure that there are clearer links between self review, short and long-term planning, professional development and teachers&rsquo; appraisal</li>
<li>more opportunities for parents to provide feedback about curriculum programmes</li>
<li>ensuring that self review leads to improved bicultural practices</li>
<li>making sure that the way teachers assess children&rsquo;s learning is consistent.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres (208) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>Information about the Early Childhood Service</span></h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
