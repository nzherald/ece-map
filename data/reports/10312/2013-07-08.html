<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Immanuel Preschool is continuing to develop its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h4>Context</h4><p>Immanuel Preschool is a small, privately owned centre in Otara that promotes a Christian philosophy and values. It provides all-day programmes for children from birth to school age. There are separate areas for younger and older children, with opportunities during the day for children of different ages to play together. All children share the recently upgraded outdoor area.</p><p>The centre has been owned by the same owner since 2009. Many of the teachers, including the supervisor, have been part of the teaching team since 2010. Most teachers are qualified and are moving towards completing their teacher registration. Some teachers reflect the cultural backgrounds of children at the centre, all of whom have M&#257;ori, Samoan, Tongan, or Cook Island M&#257;ori heritage.</p><p>ERO&rsquo;s 2010 report commented that the programme for children was interesting and varied, and that managers were building good self-review systems. Some progress has been made towards meeting ERO&rsquo;s 2010 recommendations to improve self review and further develop the programme to give children opportunities for more challenging and complex learning. The 2010 ERO report also identified that significant progress had been made to meet Ministry of Education regulations. However some concerns remain in this 2013 ERO report.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle easily to centre routines and engage happily in the programme. They choose from a variety of activities that adults provide for them and participate enthusiastically at mat times. Children play well alongside each other. They initiate and participate in conversations with other children and their teachers. The programme supports children&rsquo;s literacy and numeracy learning in different ways during the day.</p><p>Older children participate in a transition programme that provides further opportunities for them to be self managing. Babies and toddlers experience warm and nurturing relationships with their teachers. They are appropriately supported with language development and self-help skills. Younger children enjoy playing and learning with older children at different times in the programme.</p><p>Teachers plan programmes based on themes that emerge from children&rsquo;s interests. They have participated in professional learning and development (PLD) that is supporting them to improve programme planning, assessment and evaluation. Teachers encourage parent input into the programme and are interested in knowing what aspirations and goals parents have for their children.</p><p>The owner values self review and encourages staff and parents to contribute their perspectives and opinions about different aspects of the centre. Teachers are encouraged to trial different approaches and review the outcomes. Leaders are supporting teachers to accept critical feedback and to be more reflective about their practice. They are providing increasing opportunities for teachers to take leadership roles within the centre.</p><p>The owner expresses her commitment to improving the quality of education and care for children. She provides useful support for the supervisor and teachers to improve the quality of their practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO recommends that the owner continues to access external PLD for teachers to progress the following key next steps for the centre. Particular emphasis should be placed on ensuring that:</p><ul>
<li>continued improvements are made to the programme, resources and environment for babies and toddlers, and to the outdoor learning environment to benefit children of all ages</li>
<li>teachers&rsquo; interactions with children are consistently positive</li>
<li>the programme continues to be clearly based on children&rsquo;s emerging interests and child-centred principles</li>
<li>staff acknowledge the strengths of the different cultures they serve at the centre.</li>
</ul><p>The owner has a responsibility to provide an appropriate workspace for staff, and a space away from children for staff to have breaks and complete professional tasks. She has plans in place to extend the centre to make such space available, and should now give this matter priority. This would also enable her to ensure that the sleep room for babies and toddlers is more appropriately furnished and used only for sleeping children.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Immanuel Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the review ERO identified areas on non-compliance. In order to address these, the owner must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>space is available for children to sleep or rest for a reasonable period of time each day without disruption and that the space is designed to minimise fluctuations in temperature, noise and lighting levels</li>
<li>there is appropriate work space for adults to use for planned breaks, meet privately with parents and colleagues, store curriculum support materials and assess, plan and evaluate.</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, PF9, PF33, PF37 </em></p><p><em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008, 45, 47e</em></p><p>To improve practice, the owner should also ensure that all records of police vetting of staff and adults who are in the centre frequently are easily accessible and kept up to date.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>8 July 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
