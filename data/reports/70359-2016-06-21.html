</table><p>Geraldine Preschool is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Geraldine Preschool is a community-based centre governed by an elected board of parents. It is purpose-built and has recently been extended to include a new building for the oldest children.</p><p>The centre provides education and care for infants, toddlers and children to school age in three separate areas. An increasing number of children are from a diverse range of cultures.</p><p>Most teachers are qualified early childhood teachers. The senior head teacher has overall responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the centre.</p><p>The centre has attained the silver level within the Enviroschool's programme. It is also a member of the Geraldine Community of Learning, working with local schools and the kindergarten.</p><p>Since the 2012 review, the preschool has made significant progress to meet the recommendations in the ERO report. Teachers are focusing on recording children's learning, next steps and teaching strategies to support individual learning. They are using clear self-review processes and have made their bicultural commitment more evident in the preschool's philosophy and annual plan.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have respectful, positive relationships with each other and their teachers. They are highly focused on their learning and chosen tasks. Children have many opportunities to explore their interests and ideas at their own pace.</p><p>Teachers provide a welcoming, inclusive environment for children and families. They have a strong focus on developing children’s independence and self-help skills. Teachers use a clear process for assessing, planning and evaluating learning for each child. They listen carefully and talk with children in meaningful ways. Teachers extend children's learning by asking challenging questions and encouraging problem solving.</p><p>Infants and toddlers experience calm, unhurried routines and interactions with adults. Teachers effectively respond to children's interests and needs in caring ways. Children enjoy easy access to explore a wide range of appropriate resources in the spacious indoor and outside areas.</p><p>Transitions into and within the preschool are well planned, flexible and focused on the needs of the child and family. Older children are effectively supported to develop the skills and confidence to successfully transition to school. The preschool has close connections with local schools and well established transition to school processes.</p><p>The centre is very well resourced. Indoor and outdoor environments are spacious and include a strong focus on the use of natural resources. There are a number of interesting outdoor spaces for children to explore and learn together.</p><p>Parents are well informed about their child's learning and preschool events. They have many opportunities to contribute and be involved in the preschool. The preschool has effective links with and is very well supported by the local community, including fundraising assistance and provision of resources.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively. Leaders make good use of teachers' individual strengths and interests to increase team skills and knowledge. Teachers have many opportunities to be involved in a wide range of professional development.</p><p>The centre is effectively governed by the parent-led board. Centre leaders have created a clear strategic vision and plan for the centre. The strategic and annual plans are clearly linked. The senior head teacher regularly reports to the board on the progress and achievement of strategic goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree, that the next key steps to improve outcomes for children are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>bicultural practices and use of te reo Māori in learning programmes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning, evaluation and self-review processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the appraisal system.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Geraldine Preschool Incorporated will be in three years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>21 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
