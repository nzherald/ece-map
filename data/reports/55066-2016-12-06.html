</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Haumoana Playcentre is located within the small seaside community of Haumoana. The centre is open for two morning sessions per week. It is licensed for 17 children, including 10 children up to two years of age. Parents stay with their children.</p><p>The centre is managed as a parent cooperative with support from experienced personnel from the Hawkes Bay Playcentre Association (the association).</p><p>Members assist each other and learn together. All parents have or are working towards a playcentre qualification. The centre is currently going through a rebuilding stage to increase membership. A number of older children have left to attend school and there has been an increase in the enrolments of infants and toddlers. Inquiring into, and catering for the learning needs of this group is a focus of the centre’s current internal evaluation.</p><p>The association has addressed the areas for development identified in the February 2014 ERO report. It has defined the roles and responsibilities of the executive committee to provide better support for individual playcentres. Procedures for the employment of paid staff have been developed and implemented. These include police vetting and appraisal.</p><p>Playcentre's philosophy emphasises the importance of parents sharing the responsibility for the education of their children within a community-based family environment where play is valued as meaningful learning. A commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi is expressed and aspects are evident in practice. Haumoana Playcentre is considering developing its own philosophy to better reflect what members value.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven in the Hawkes Bay Playcentre Association</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn and play in a positive, calm and unhurried environment. They are supported to take risks and problem solve, develop confidence and a sense of belonging. Children are encouraged to lead their learning, experiment and engage in creative play.</p><p>Literacy, numeracy and science are appropriately integrated into the programme. Children have easy access to resources and contribute to decision making. This fosters a strong sense of independence. Adults actively engage with children, fostering child-led learning.</p><p>There is a strong desire for children to be physically active, with adults assisting their skill development through providing an outdoor environment that encourages physical play. Flexible learning spaces and open-ended resources promote curiosity, inquiry and exploration. Careful consideration is given to the individual needs of all children, including those up to the age of two years.</p><p>The curriculum is informed by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and the playcentre philosophy, and is focussed on outcomes for children's learning. It is responsive to children's interests and developmental milestones. Assessment, curriculum planning and evaluation practices provide adults with useful information to help them plan programmes responsive to children's interests, strengths and identified needs.</p><p>Progress has been made in improving assessment, planning and evaluation practices. More experienced members have identified the need to continue to assist new parents to develop knowledge and understanding of assessment, planning and evaluation. Planned workshops for new members should continue to help their understanding of children's assessment.</p><p>Individual profile books are attractive and valued by children and their parents. They capture and celebrate children's participation and engagement in centre activities and events. A strong sense of family is evident which is aligned to the playcentre philosophy.</p><p>Strengthening understanding of children requiring additional learning support to enable them to participate in the playcentre programme is a next step.</p><p>As a result of recent self review, members have sought professional learning opportunities to strengthen practices that support Māori learners. Continuing to develop culturally responsive practices should assist with celebrating diversity. Puriri Whakamaru o Heretaunga is an association initiative which provides support to Māori whānau attending playcentre, and guidance to individual centres to strengthen their understanding of te ao Māori.</p><p>Children's time at playcentre is formally celebrated as they leave. Continuing to strengthen relationships with local schools should help to promote experiences that assist children and their families as they transition to school.</p><p>Parents are strongly committed to the playcentre philosophy and increasing participation. With the number of new members attending, they are seeking ways with the support of the association to achieve a playcentre qualification with a focus on succession and sustainability.</p><p>A framework for the appraisal of paid team members has been developed. The association continues to support the playcentre with its implementation.</p><p>There is an established framework for self review which guides the inquiry process and results in improvement. It is focussed on positive learning outcomes for children. Continuing to build capability of new members to develop their understanding of internal evaluation is a next step.</p><p>The association has put in place sound systems and processes to provide ongoing centre support until the national restructure of playcentre has been completed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Members and ERO have agreed that there is a need for parents, with the support of the association, to continue to develop their knowledge and understanding of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children requiring additional learning support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>transitions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Haumoana Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Haumoana Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>6 December 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
