</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Onerahi Free Kindergarten is one of 21 kindergartens that operate under the governance of the Northland Kindergarten Association. The kindergarten is in an outlying suburb of Whangarei, and serves a multicultural community. Whānau sometimes travel lengthy distances to attend the kindergarten.</p><p>The kindergarten has recently changed the hours children may attend by providing school day sessions for three days a week. Families are able to select the days they wish children to attend. Some children continue to attend morning sessions only.</p><p>The association provides a framework of policies and procedures that are reviewed and updated on a regular basis. Teachers’ practices are monitored and supported by a number of association personnel including a Māori Pou Whakarewa Tikanga who has supported teachers to strengthen their bicultural practises. An association speech language therapist also supports children and teachers. Regular visits and reports from the professional practice manager affirm teachers’ work and identify improvements they should consider.</p><p>Teachers are able to access regular professional development provided by the association. This support fosters the association’s expectations of high quality practices from teachers. Day-to-day management of the kindergarten is delegated to the head teacher and the teaching team.</p><p>Onerahi Free Kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children thrive in a programme that supports them to make choices and include their friends. They are eager to attend and settle quickly at the start of the day. Warm welcomes for families and children set the scene for the lively and positive tone to the day. Teachers work collaboratively to provide high quality programmes.</p><p>Children take meaningful leadership roles by planning their own play and learning. Teachers provide resources and suggestions to encourage children to think about their play and extend their learning. Children are collaborative and friendly. They talk cheerfully together and often use tuakana/teina strategies to include others in imaginative games. Inclusion practices are well established and modelled by both children and teachers.</p><p>Programmes that support te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are well established. Teachers initially worked with the association Pou Whakarewa Tikanga and now take responsibility for increasing their own focus on bicultural education. One teacher in particular, supports the team to strengthen their own and children’s understanding of New Zealand’s bicultural heritage. Learning about Māori legends, particularly about the local area, forms an important part of the programme. The association’s Pumanawatanga bicultural programme provides a clear framework for teachers.</p><p>Teachers initiate conversations that encourage and support children’s ideas and thinking. Opportunities to learn about the value of reading, writing, numeracy and scientific exploration are linked to enjoyable play experiences. Children are also becoming proficient with using information and communication technologies (ICT) as part of the programme. Children transition easily to school.</p><p>Children’s portfolios provide informative glimpses into their activities and experiences. Photographs and children’s own words provide authentic explanations about what they learn through their play. Teachers’ knowledge about children’s strengths and interests adds to the development of supportive and interesting planning.</p><p>Teachers use detailed self review to reflect on their work with children and to make decisions about their teaching. Team leadership plays an important part in the effectiveness of programmes, and teachers are enthusiastic about their work. Whānau have opportunities to contribute to decisionmaking about developments or changes to practices. Children are included when review impacts on their play and the resources provided for them. Teachers make responding to partnership opportunities easy for families by explaining their thinking clearly and encouraging participation. Families appreciate the opportunity to contribute.</p><p>Management systems and processes are closely linked to association expectations and frameworks. Teachers appreciate the useful support and guidance provided by association personnel which helps them to sustain high quality practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, association representatives and teachers identified next steps for the kindergarten to be:</p><ul>
<li>considering ways of extending children’s play further to broaden their learning experiences</li>
<li>revisiting ways to promote programmes around healthy eating for children and parents</li>
<li>continue building upon inclusion of cultural diversity in programmes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Onerahi Free Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Onerahi Free Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>26 August 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
