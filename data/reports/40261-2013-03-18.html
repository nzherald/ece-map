<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Te Whare Kohungahunga o Ng&#257; Whetu Tiaho Shining Stars Preschool is well placed to sustain and promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Te Whare Kohungahunga o Ng&#257; Whetu Tiaho Shining Stars preschool is situated in Opotiki and provides education and care for 30 children from 2 years to school age. Since the previous review in 2009 the centre has increased its roll. Good progress has been made with the recommendations in that report resulting in significant improvements to the buildings and resources.</p><p>In addition teachers have participated in whole staff professional development with a focus on quality teaching practice. Teachers are well qualified and the centre benefits from the additional support of a knowledgeable matua and kuia.</p><p>The centre aims to provide tamariki mokopuna with the skills and knowledge to become successful leaders now and in the future. The centre is governed by a trust.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Trustees and centre leaders, in consultation with wh&#257;nau and the community, are providing a service which places priority on success for M&#257;ori children and their families. A deep understanding of Te Ao M&#257;ori lies at the heart of this centre. Trustees and the centre manager have developed a shared philosophy, vision and goals that reflect the aspirations that wh&#257;nau have for their children. The strategic plan is currently being reviewed and updated after extensive consultation to ensure there is a clear future direction for the centre. Appropriate policies are in place to guide centre operations. Centre leaders and management promote and foster equity and social justice for tamariki and wh&#257;nau through mentoring and tautoko. Trustees provide ongoing support for the centre manager and staff.</p><p>Centre leadership maintains a focus on building emergent leadership and capability within the service to promote positive outcomes for children. Wh&#257;nau and children are encouraged to take leadership roles and responsibilities. Leaders understand wh&#257;nau aspirations and expectations and work collaboratively and responsively to achieve them. Regular and ongoing professional development is undertaken by staff, and the centre manager encourages teachers to continually reflect on their teaching to improve their practice.</p><p>The curriculum places an emphasis on whanaungatanga, well being and belonging to enable children to develop their confidence and leadership. Children are first and foremost valued for who they are and what they bring to their learning. Whakapapa is integral to the curriculum for developing a sense of self and connectedness. Many opportunities are provided for children to make sense of the natural and physical world, be creative and have fun as they learn about the world around them. Many trips and excursions enrich the curriculum. These include regular visits to Opape marae, Waiotahe pipi beds, the local reserve, the wharf, Tarawa stream and library.</p><p>Kaiako have formed strong and constructive partnerships with parents and children. They know children well, have a good understanding of the mana, wairua and mauri of each child and are responsive to their care and learning needs. Kaiako meet regularly to plan and implement programmes which are based on children&rsquo;s interests. Many opportunities are provided by kaiako to explore literacy concepts and skills. A particular feature of the centre is the books made to tell the stories about visits the children have made, the local environment, and places and people of interest.</p><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that areas for development and review are to:</p><ul>
<li>clarify and rationalise roles and responsibilities of trustees and centre manager to support centre administration</li>
<li>provide regular robust feedback to teachers about their practice, linked to best practice in ECE</li>
<li>develop a shared and agreed approach to documenting the learning and development of tamariki in individual profile books</li>
<li>ensure that goals set for children are learned through activities that are appropriate, engaging and meaningful for them.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Te Whare Kohungahunga o Ng&#257; Whetu Tiaho Shining Stars Preschool completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they select &lsquo;have&rsquo; or &lsquo;have not&rsquo; taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>18 March 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
