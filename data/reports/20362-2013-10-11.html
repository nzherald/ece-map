</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Smart Start Montessori Grange Road and Ellerton Road Preschools are situated in Mount Eden, Auckland. Both centres are managed and operated by the same owners. Care and education is provided for children from two and a half years to six years of age. Smart Start Montessori (Grange Rd) is licensed for 20 children. The preschool caters for children from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The preschool philosophy is guided by the Montessori vision of holistic development and the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. This philosophy is evident in the quality of environment, resources and interactions.</p><p>The preschool staff are long serving, with two fully registered and one provisionally registered teacher. The owner and staff have been responsive to the recommendations of the 2010 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are articulate, confident and competent learners. They demonstrate high levels of engagement in both independent and collaborative play. They are able to assess their own learning, progress and achievement. Children have a strong sense of belonging and ownership within the centre.</p><p>Children have highly developed social competencies. They interact very effectively with adults and initiate conversations about their own learning. They engage with other children and support each other well in tuakana/teina relationships. Teachers support children’s learning and social development effectively through a focus on ‘grace and courtesy’ skills as part of the Montessori philosophy.</p><p>Complex learning is evident in the programme. Teachers are experts at implementing all aspects of the Montessori curriculum. Significant professional development has supported them to further strengthen teaching practices based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>. They competently develop children’s thinking and reasoning skills. They recognise the value of children engaging in complex imaginative play and the creative use of materials. They have high quality interactions with children through open-ended questioning and the use of terminology that enriches children’s vocabulary and knowledge. Literacy and numeracy concepts are well integrated throughout the environment and teaching practice.</p><p>There has been a significant shift in the curriculum from a teacher-led approach to a focus on child-led learning. Programme planning now reflects children’s interests. Teachers make teaching and learning decisions based on their in-depth knowledge of each child. Teachers provide opportunities for parents to share their aspirations for their children and to contribute to planning decisions. They also keep parents informed about children’s learning and development in a variety of ways.</p><p>Teachers honour the cultural uniqueness that Māori and other children bring with them. There is a genuine and respectful valuing of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori in centre practices and interactions. Cultural celebrations of the families are highlighted in the programme to raise children’s awareness of others’ cultures and to develop pride in their own.</p><p>The centre owner is committed to providing a high quality service for parents and children. The owner and staff work very collaboratively. There is a shared understanding of management and teaching practices. Head teachers are open to new teaching and learning approaches. They seek to extend their knowledge and model good practice to guide other staff.</p><p>Both Smart Start Montessori centres operate under the same management systems and procedures. As a result of professional development, policies and procedures, annual planning and self review have been recently reviewed and improved. In response to the 2010 ERO report recommendation, self review has been extended to include the review of teaching and learning practices. Leaders and teachers have a good understanding of self review and are very well placed to sustain good practice and generate further improvements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree on the following next steps to further enhance capability and sustainability. Centre leaders could:</p><ul>
<li>continue to review the use of learning stories to show children’s interests and progression of learning over time</li>
<li>increase the robustness of appraisal systems, including alignment to the Registered Teachers Criteria</li>
<li>ensure teacher appraisals are signed off by a fully registered teacher</li>
<li>consider engaging an external mentor to support and appraise the owner/manager</li>
<li>develop a manageable cycle for self review of policies</li>
<li>consider the formatting of strategic goals more effectively to align with annual planning</li>
<li>monitor progress against annual and strategic goals.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Smart Start Montessori (Grange Rd) Pre-School completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Smart Start Montessori (Grange Rd) Pre-School will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>11 October 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"> ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
