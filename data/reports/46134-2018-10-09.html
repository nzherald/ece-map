</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Maketu EduCare provides education and care for up to 22 children from two years to school age, in a mixed-age setting. The current roll of 21, includes 14 Māori children, many of whom whakapapa to Te Arawa and Ngāti Whakaue. The educare is an all-day service located on the grounds of Maketū School. It is governed and managed by a charitable trust. The centre receives equity funding from the Ministry of Education and uses this to employ additional staff to enhance teacher-to-child ratios.</p><p>Through the philosophy teachers aim to work together with tamariki and their whānau, sharing skills to promote better outcomes. Understanding and respecting cultures, healthy food, oral health and life education are also valued in the philosophy.</p><p>ERO's last review in 2015 identified key next steps in the management of assessment, mat time organisation and its impact on children’s interest and enjoyment. These two aspects of practice continue to be areas for development.</p><p>Since the last review there have been significant changes to the teaching team and the centre’s relationship with the school.</p><p>Professional learning and development has focused on mathematics.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre priorities effectively promote positive outcomes for children. The recently reviewed philosophy is underpinned by shared values, including strong acknowledgement of Māori as tangata whenua. The philosophy is integral to a strong sense of identity and belonging for all children, their families and centre staff.</p><p>The curriculum clearly reflects the local community and family aspirations for their children. Māori children enjoy planned and spontaneous opportunities to engage, learn and make connections as Māori in the centre and wider community. Teachers naturally integrate te reo and tikanga Māori throughout the programme. Children respond positively to these experiences affirming their cultural identity. In addition, the sustained focus on 'Maths in Maketu' is extending children's and families understanding and use of mathematics in meaningful contexts. This approach supports continuity of learning for children between the centre, homes and wider community.</p><p>Respectful relationships are highly evident at all levels in the centre. Teachers are welcoming and inclusive of all children and their families. They celebrate each family's culture and acknowledge parent and whānau aspirations, valuing their involvement and contributions to the programme and centre events. Collaboration between families and teachers contributes to children’s self confidence and sense of security in the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the licensee and head teacher agree that the centre needs to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>re-establish a productive working relationship with the Maketu School board of trustees and principal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>access support for the head teacher to provide professional leadership that extends the teaching capability of staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to review and develop assessment, planning and evaluation ensuring that all teachers understand and are able to contribute to these processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>access professional learning and development for teachers to enable them to deepen their responses to what they notice and recognise about children’s interests, strengths, dispositions and learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that centre management accesses external support to effectively respond to these key next steps.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Maketu EduCare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance.</p><p>The service provider must ensure:</p><ul>
<li>a better standard of cleaning to ensure hygiene practices meet the standard</li>
<li>fire emergency drills are carried out and documented on at least a 3 monthly basis</li>
<li>furniture or equipment that could topple and cause injury or damage is secured. <br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS1, HS6, HS8]</em></li>
</ul><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should review current nappy change facilities to more appropriately cater for children’s ages and independence, and take account of staff wellbeing.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Maketu EduCare will be in three years.</p><p>Adrienne Fowler</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>9 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
