<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p align="left">Tai Tamariki Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p align="left">Te Manawa, the association&rsquo;s criteria for curriculum implementation, is a recent positive initiative. The document provides a clear framework for teachers to deliver a high quality, inclusive early childhood education programme.</p>
<p align="left">Tai Tamariki Kindergarten has been operating since February 2010 and is located in the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (Te Papa). It caters primarily for children of Te Papa staff, and other families in the central city. As a full day service, it offers flexible start and finish times for children.</p>
<p align="left">A welcoming, family-like and inclusive environment is provided for children and their wh&#257;nau. Teachers know children well and demonstrate genuine interest in their well-being. Their interests are well supported as they engage in independent and collaborative activities. Children of all ages interact freely in shared spaces. Aesthetically pleasing and well-organised areas foster children&rsquo;s investigation and exploration.</p>
<p align="left">The location offers a range of rich learning opportunities. Children enjoy excursions to a variety of museum exhibits and learning spaces, as well as exploring and utilising the inner city environment. Fostering these links with the local community and environment strengthens children&rsquo;s sense of belonging. Teachers work in partnership with the museum staff to ensure children&rsquo;s experiences are valuable and rich. Further enrichment of interactions and extending and embedding planning processes should provide additional challenge and purposeful engagement of children in learning.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers have identified that refining their shared understanding of quality provision for infants and toddlers and building effective self review, is likely to enhance practice and promote ongoing improvement.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p align="left">Before the review, the management of Tai Tamariki Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atTai Tamariki Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p>
<ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p align="left">Tai Tamariki Kindergarten was established in February 2010. As a full day service, it offers flexible start and finish times for children within its operating hours of 8am&ndash;6pm. The teaching team includes a number of provisionally and newly registered teachers who receive support from kindergarten staff and the association&rsquo;s senior teacher.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p align="left">Programme Child initiated, play-based learning forms the basis of the daily programme. Flexible routines support children&rsquo;s well-being, encouraging them to make choices and providing opportunities for sustained and uninterrupted play. Children&rsquo;s interests are well developed by teachers as they engage in independent and collaborative activities.</p>
<p align="left">Staff demonstrate a commitment and shared understanding of an integrated approach to te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori. Regular opportunities for children to learn about te ao M&#257;ori are evident.</p>
<p align="left">Assessment, Planning and Evaluation Planning is responsive to children&rsquo;s interests, draws on prior knowledge and broadens their experiences. A variety of ways for children to revisit and reflect on previous learning promotes interest and enriches learning.</p>
<p align="left">Well-presented and informative portfolios celebrate children&rsquo;s engagement with the programme and highlight developing relationships. Children demonstrate a sense of ownership of these records of learning.</p>
<p align="left">Interactions A welcoming, family-like and inclusive environment is provided for children and their wh&#257;nau. Children relate confidently and respectfully with peers and adults within the centre. A calm and settled tone is evident.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers know children well and demonstrate genuine interest in their well-being. Staff identify the provision of key workers for children as a priority and are flexible in meeting this need. They involve children in conversations relevant to their world and make links to prior experiences. A wide range of strategies are used to inform and communicate with parents about the programme and centre operations. A review of parent participation is ongoing and has strengthened practices.</p>
<p align="left">Environment Children confidently explore in the positive learning environment. Aesthetically pleasing and well-organised spaces foster children&rsquo;s investigation and exploration. Quiet spaces allow children places of retreat throughout the day. A range of appropriate resources and natural materials is available for children to explore and use creatively. Children&rsquo;s work is valued and visually displayed to enable them to revisit their experiences and to communicate learning to parents. Teachers use the extended local environment to support children&rsquo;s developing physical skills.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p align="left">Kindergarten staff and ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation have identified the following aspects of practice that require strengthening. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>further developing a shared understanding of effective infant and toddler practices to enhance children&rsquo;s learning and support their developing independence</li>
<li>more consistent use of rich conversations to add complexity and depth to children&rsquo;s thinking</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen assessment information documented in portfolios by:</li>
<li>identifying the actual learning taking place for the individual</li>
<li>adding greater depth to the analysis of learning</li>
<li>drawing links between entries to provide a sense of continuity and progress</li>
<li>suggesting possible next steps for learning.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Further development of programme evaluation and planning should provide opportunities for teachers to reflect more deeply and inquire into their teaching. This should assist them to respond more deliberately with teaching strategies that challenge, extend and support children&rsquo;s engagement in purposeful learning.</p>
<p align="left">Staff have identified that they are at an early stage of developing their self review. ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation agrees. Areas for strengthening should include the use of:</p>
<ul>
<li>evaluative questions to frame review</li>
<li>comprehensive data gathering and analysis of relevant information aligned to identified indicators</li>
<li>specific recommendations for next steps and continuous improvement.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Association Support</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p align="left">The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p>
<p align="left">Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p>
<p align="left">The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p align="left">The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the strategic plan, setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</li>
<li>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</li>
<li>a wide range of professional development opportunities</li>
<li>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing</li>
</ul>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p align="left">The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where they can strengthen their support for teachers. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</li>
<li>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice as a result of feedback.</li>
<li>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association strategic priorities.</li>
</ul>
<a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3>
<p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing wellbeing, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">The kindergarten is well positioned to cater effectively for children with moderate to severe needs through the good relationships developed with families and the inclusive practices demonstrated by staff. Children and families are supported in a range of ways to ease transition to school, including being accompanied by a teacher in school visits. Senior management recognise the need to communicate their capacity to provide for children with special learning needs in their information for prospective parents.</p>
<a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Tai Tamariki Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>

<p>13 December 2011</p>
<p>To the Parents and Community of Tai Tamariki Kindergarten</p>
<p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Tai Tamariki Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">Tai Tamariki Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p align="left">Te Manawa, the association&rsquo;s criteria for curriculum implementation, is a recent positive initiative. The document provides a clear framework for teachers to deliver a high quality, inclusive early childhood education programme.</p>
<p align="left">Tai Tamariki Kindergarten has been operating since February 2010 and is located in the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (Te Papa). It caters primarily for children of Te Papa staff, and other families in the central city. As a full day service, it offers flexible start and finish times for children.</p>
<p align="left">A welcoming, family-like and inclusive environment is provided for children and their wh&#257;nau. Teachers know children well and demonstrate genuine interest in their well-being. Their interests are well supported as they engage in independent and collaborative activities. Children of all ages interact freely in shared spaces. Aesthetically pleasing and well-organised areas foster children&rsquo;s investigation and exploration.</p>
<p align="left">The location offers a range of rich learning opportunities. Children enjoy excursions to a variety of museum exhibits and learning spaces, as well as exploring and utilising the inner city environment. Fostering these links with the local community and environment strengthens children&rsquo;s sense of belonging. Teachers work in partnership with the museum staff to ensure children&rsquo;s experiences are valuable and rich. Further enrichment of interactions and extending and embedding planning processes should provide additional challenge and purposeful engagement of children in learning.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers have identified that refining their shared understanding of quality provision for infants and toddlers and building effective self review, is likely to enhance practice and promote ongoing improvement.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p>
<p align="left"><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
