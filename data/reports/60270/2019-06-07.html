</table><p>Johnsonville Childcare is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Johnsonville Childcare is a multicultural service that provides all-day education and care for children aged six months to five years, in two separate areas. It is licensed for 75 children, including 25 up to the age of two. Of the 84 children currently enrolled, 11 are Māori and six are Pacific. The philosophy promotes a holistic approach to learning, working alongside families and whānau.</p><p>The privately owned centre is part of the Wellington Childcare group. The licensee and a centre director oversee the service, with day-to-day operation delegated to a centre manager. Room leaders have responsibility for the curriculum. Most teachers are fully qualified, with others working towards full certification.</p><p>The May 2016 ERO report identified many areas for continued development to improve outcomes for children. These included: defining expectations of quality interactions; strengthening assessment and planning; building evaluation capacity; and improving the appraisal process. Steady progress is evident in all of these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and confident. They experience warm, positive relationships with teachers. Belonging and wellbeing are purposefully and successfully promoted. Family involvement is welcomed. Children's diverse home languages are valued and used.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from a calm, child-led approach. Teachers gather and use information from parents about home routines, and are respectful of children's preferences. Warm, unhurried care moments are valued as relationship-building opportunities.</p><p>The learning environments are inviting and well-resourced. There are many opportunities for creative, expressive and imaginative exploration. Social competence and respect for peers is effectively promoted.</p><p>Successful transition processes are supported through useful communication between families and centre personnel. A planned programme for four year olds supports their transition to school. Sensitive transitions into and through the centre promote children’s wellbeing.</p><p>A high level of commitment to bicultural practice is apparent. Teachers value te reo Māori and integrate this meaningfully into the programme. The languages and symbols of children’s cultural backgrounds, including the diversity of Pacific heritages, are visible within the environment. Teachers view each family and its knowledge of their child as an integral part of the service’s learning community. ERO affirms centre plans to consult with whānau Māori about ways to further localise practices for their children.</p><p>Teachers are increasingly working with the goals, dispositions and learning outcomes of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Planning practices support children to understand and contribute to decisions about their learning. Routines are consistently implemented giving children a sense of security in being able to predict what will happen next. This was particularly evident in the programme for four year olds.</p><p>Detailed observations in learning portfolios of children’s play and interactions celebrate their strengths, interests and at times show their progress over time. Teachers should make better use of their good knowledge of children, their cultural contexts, and their parents’ aspirations, to plan, enact and evaluate targeted strategies for individuals. This should be clearly evident in documentation.</p><p>A suitable framework for review and evaluation has been developed. Formal and spontaneous reviews are undertaken with the latter responsive to both internal and external events. The leadership team is aware that internal evaluation requires further strengthening to ensure shared understandings and consistent implementation of each stage of the process. Teachers confidently engage in discussion and debate that challenges and informs improvements to practice.</p><p>Recent improvements to the appraisal system provide an increased focus on developing practice to improve outcomes for children. Appropriate professional learning opportunities and ongoing collegial discussions progress centre goals.</p><p>Collaborative ways of working are fostered. Leaders and teachers willingly share their knowledge and are encouraged to work to their strengths. An affirming team culture supports teachers to focus on promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Strengthened organisational systems and processes support the operation of the service. The useful internal audit form should be used to better monitor health and safety requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre Leaders agree to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build a shared understanding of evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embed children’s culture, language and identity in assessment, planning and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop links with the wider Māori community to extend te reo me ngā tikanga practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Johnsonville Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice the service provider should ensure that all aspects of forms required for health and safety, particularly medicine administration and excursions, are consistently completed.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>7 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
