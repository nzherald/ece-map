</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lincoln Road Childcare &amp; Kindergarten provides all-day education and care for up to 32 children over two years of age. The centre operates in the premises of Lincoln Road Bible Chapel in Henderson. The largest group of children are Korean. Small numbers of Māori and Pacific children attend.</p><p>The centre philosophy is founded on a Christian curriculum and is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The philosophy is very well enacted.</p><p>The centre is led by an experienced, qualified early childhood teacher who is new to the role of head teacher. She ably leads the day to day programme and has leadership of curriculum, operations and management. Four Bible Chapel members support and oversee the management and governance of the centre.</p><p>Three registered teachers, an unqualified teacher and a cook make up the staff. They focus on building close and reciprocal partnerships with the culturally diverse families that attend the centre.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report noted areas for improvement which included developing teachers' understanding of the curriculum, and supporting children to become capable and confident leaders of their learning. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled, and enjoy a calm environment with an unhurried atmosphere. They are familiar with the centre's routines and its inclusive practices. Children have trusting and respectful relationships with teachers. Their independence is fostered. Children are confident explorers and direct their own play. They are supported to communicate and develop oral skills. Literacy and life skills are promoted.</p><p>Children engage readily in play. They have easy access to a wide variety of equipment, and make good use of the indoor and outdoor environment. Teachers invite and engage children in play and skill building. They are responsive to children's emerging interests. Teachers could review planning practices to focus on ways children's learning can be extended and challenged.</p><p>Teachers believe in children as capable and confident learners. They work in partnership with parents and children to set goals related to their next phase of development. Together they form possible strategies to achieve these goals. Teachers record children's progress and participation in individual assessment portfolios.</p><p>Teachers are committed to promoting bicultural practices. They integrate these well as part of the daily programme. Teachers support each other to speak te reo and incorporate tikanga Māori into the programme.</p><p>Children's cultural identities are accepted and celebrated in all aspects of the programme. Teachers strategically learn and use families' home languages to involve children fully in the centre. Teachers see themselves as interested and passionate learners, and build caring reciprocal relationships with children and parents.</p><p>The transition to school programme is well established. Teachers support children to develop their literacy and numeracy skills, and to increase their self-management and self-help skills. Teachers provide opportunities for children to connect with a local school.</p><p>The board of governors is effective in managing the centre. Governors liaise well with the head teacher. They support the centre's strategic direction and well aligned processes. Effective internal evaluation focused on continual improvement is developing. The board supports the head teacher very well with opportunities for relevant mentoring and external professional guidance.</p><p>The head teacher leads the centre with commitment and has high expectations of her staff. She recognises the capabilities of teachers. A new team is being built with a shared leadership model. Teachers are being empowered to share their individual strengths, and to build the professional capacity of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps are for teachers and leaders to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop learning partnership with parents by making more visible the planning process as a framework for children's goals</li>
<li>continue to improve and embed ongoing internal evaluation</li>
<li>review the complexity of play opportunities to extend and challenge older children's thinking</li>
<li>continue to develop and document an appraisal system that improves leadership capacity and teaching practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lincoln Road Childcare &amp; Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lincoln Road Childcare &amp; Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>13 March 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
