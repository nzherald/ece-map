<a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><p>This supplementary review report was prepared in accordance with standard procedures approved by the Chief Review Officer.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of A Kidz World Home-based Childcare and Education Service governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the April 2010 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>management relating to professional leadership, support for educators and coordinators and quality assurance; and</li>
<li>programme, learning environment and interactions.</li>
</ul><a id="2-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>A Kidz World Home-Based Childcare and Education Service is based in the Bay of Plenty and Auckland. The network is one of two privately owned services that provide education and care for children in educarers’ homes. The licensee/owner is the care arranger and coordinator. This network is in the greater Auckland area and caters for children from birth to school age.</p><p>Children continue to benefit from the trusting, close and positive relationships they have with their home-based educators. A strength is the open communication among educators and families. Children who have English as a second language also benefit from educators encouraging them to be confident in their own culture, as well as developing an understanding about New Zealand’s culture. The coordinator provides regular support and guidance for educators. This includes financial support with resources and professional development opportunities for educators to increase their knowledge in family home-based care.</p><p>Since the last review, the coordinator has made good progress in response to the areas for further improvement identified in the April 2010 ERO report. These relate to improving the quality of the programme, environment and interactions.</p><p>The licensee and ERO agree that the next step for further development is to implement evidence based self-review practices to ensure ongoing improvement to all aspects of service operations and the quality of education and care.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><a id="3-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Findings</h2><h3>Management and quality assurance practices</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2010 ERO report acknowledged that the service demonstrated good communication with educators and provided them with some useful resources and financial support. Areas that required review and development included:</p><ul>
<li>providing a provisionally registered teachers advice and guidance programme and undertaking annual appraisal practices;</li>
<li>enhancing opportunities for educators to be able to attend play groups and other outings within the local community to enhance the quality of education for children; and</li>
<li>addressing all non-compliance actions identified in the 2010 ERO report.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for further improvement</h4><p><strong>Compliance:</strong> While the coordinator has a health and safety checklist that is completed every month, it would be beneficial to increase the educator’s responsibility to identify and monitor the health and safety requirements in their home learning environments.</p><p><strong>Provisional teacher registration:</strong> An external provider has been contracted to provide an advice and guidance programme for provisional teacher registration. Currently there is insufficient documented evidence to meet registration requirements.</p><p><strong>Self-review practices:</strong> The service has progressed well through its informal self review practices that have led to improvements. It would be beneficial for the coordinator to develop a planned approach to self review to effectively evaluate the quality of education, and to make informed evidence based decisions for future developments.</p><h3>Programme, learning interactions and environment</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The previous review identified that relationships among adults and children were respectful and responsive. Areas requiring further improvement related to:</p><ul>
<li>planning and assessment practices;</li>
<li>learning conversations that add complexity to children’s learning;</li>
<li>meaningful learning resources and activities;</li>
<li>the use of Māori culture and language; and</li>
<li>social and learning opportunities outside the home through the use of the wider community.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p><strong>Assessment and planning:</strong> The coordinator has introduced learning stories to document children’s experiences and learning while receiving home-based care. This has included developing templates and procedures to guide educators. Some educators are using Kei tua ō te pāe (the early childhood exemplars) to increase their knowledge and understanding of documenting children’s learning.</p><p><strong>Literacy and mathematics:</strong> Some educators are skilled in integrating meaningful literacy and mathematical concepts through children’s play. Children regularly share books, and have access to writing and drawing materials which promote their developing interest in early literacy concepts. Mathematical concepts are naturally integrated into children’s play.</p><p><strong>Resources and environments:</strong> Homes visited during the review provided children with a wide range of appropriate indoor and outdoor resources to explore. A Kidz World supports educators by contributing additional learning resources, with some that reflect Māori culture. Educator’s home learning environments were thoughtfully prepared and gave children a good range of activities that encourage children to pursue their interests.</p><p><strong>Social relationships:</strong> Educators have close trusting relationships with children and their families. Families value the small group size and close friendships their children develop. Educators encourage children to be confident in their own culture and to develop an appreciation of New Zealand’s multicultural society. These relationships foster a positive climate for learning.</p><p><strong>Learning within the wider community:</strong> The coordinator has promoted and encouraged educators to attend playgroups and take children on outings in the local community. She has also organised a network excursion for educators and their care children. This provides children with a wider range of learning experiences and an opportunity for educators to support one another in their roles.</p><h4>Area for further improvement</h4><p><strong>Professional learning and development:</strong> It is necessary for the licensee as the professional leader to continue to build her capacity in understanding current early childhood theory, and increase educators’ knowledge in learning story assessment practice. This should contribute to future ongoing development in the quality of care and education for children.</p><a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>4 Recommendation</span></h2><p>ERO recommends that:</p><ol>
<li>the care arranger access external professional development to build on self- review practices.</li>
</ol><a id="5-action-required-for-compliance" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>5 Action Required for Compliance</span></h2><ol>
<li>In order to improve practice the coordinator should ensure that educators understand their obligations in meeting all health and safety requirements. <em>[Education (Home-Based Care) Order 1992]</em></li>
</ol><a id="6-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>6 Future Action</span></h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>13 June 2011</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

The network is one of two privately owned services that provide education and care for children in educarers’ homes. The licensee/owner is the care arranger and coordinator. This network is in the greater Auckland area and caters for children from birth to school age.</p><p>Children continue to benefit from the trusting, close and positive relationships they have with their home-based educators. A strength is the open communication among educators and families. Children who have English as a second language also benefit from educators encouraging them to be confident in their own culture, as well as developing an understanding about New Zealand’s culture. The coordinator provides regular support and guidance for educators. This includes financial support with resources and professional development opportunities for educators to increase their knowledge in family home-based care.</p><p>Since the last review, the coordinator has made good progress in response to the areas for further improvement identified in the April 2010 ERO report. These relate to improving the quality of the programme, environment and interactions.</p><p>The licensee and ERO agree that the next step for further development is to implement evidence based self-review practices to ensure ongoing improvement to all aspects of service operations and the quality of education and care.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow-up action they plan to do. You should talk to the management or licensee if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p>
