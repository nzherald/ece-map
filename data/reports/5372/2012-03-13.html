<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Paparangi Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. A team of senior teachers is employed, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team at this service. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">Teachers&rsquo; strong team approach provides effective support for programme development and operation. Good practice and innovation are sustained through their commitment to staying up to date with research, actively seeking opportunities for new learning and developing strong links with the community.</p><p align="left">Development of reciprocal and trusting relationships with parents is a priority for teachers. Families feel valued and confident their views will be heard and respected. An emphasis on the history, culture and the place of the kindergarten in the community, along with a strong commitment to biculturalism, are enhancing the curriculum.</p><p align="left">The learning environment is well developed and maintained to support early learning. An extensive range of high quality resources, including many natural materials, is able to be freely accessed by children for much of the time. Literacy and mathematics are well resourced and integrated in meaningful ways. Children&rsquo;s creativity and self expression are encouraged.</p><p align="left">Children have freedom to make choices about their participation and use of resources and have many opportunities to collaborate with adults. Activities mostly stem from emerging ideas and investigations. Teachers use some good strategies to inspire interest and participation. Positive guidance promotes harmonious relationships.</p><p align="left">The senior teacher, teaching team and ERO have agreed on priority areas for development and review. Teachers want to further strengthen their approach to assessment and implementation of aspects of the programme and will continue to seek appropriate support and advice in relation to their bicultural journey.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Paparangi Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atPaparangi Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Since the April 2008 ERO review the kindergarten has been relicensed as an all-day service with a maximum roll of 40. Ratios of teachers to children have increased to 1:10 with the employment of an additional teacher. For two days the programme is primarily for children aged three years. For the other three days those aged four years attend.</p><p align="left">Two members of the teaching team remain from the time of the previous ERO review, one of whom has taken over the position of head teacher.</p><p align="left">Continuing development is being undertaken to improve the outdoor play space. Utility areas have recently been refurbished.</p><p align="left">Recent teaching focuses include work on: Te Manawa, the association&rsquo;s recently developed criteria for curriculum implementation; the bicultural perspective in the programme; and a place-based education initiative. Strengthening the links with parents and the community is an ongoing priority.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p align="left">The learning environment is well developed and maintained. An extensive range of high quality resources, including many natural materials, is freely accessed by children for much of the day. These are thoughtfully arranged to attract children&rsquo;s interest. The science area is a particular feature with its variety of sensory and interactive resources. The outdoor area supports a range of physical activities and learning experiences related to the natural world. Children&rsquo;s motivation and independence as learners are fostered through the opportunities provided in this environment.</p><p align="left">Teachers use some good strategies to inspire interest, ideas and participation. Positive guidance is used well to promote harmonious relationships. A &lsquo;treaty of respect&rsquo; supports teachers&rsquo; consistent practice and children&rsquo;s understanding of the expectations for their behaviour.</p><p align="left">A strong commitment to biculturalism is evident. Teachers have continued to review and develop their approach over a long period of time and base their practice on recent research linked to te ao M&#257;ori, and wh&#257;nau and community input. Elements of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori are woven throughout the programme and environment. Children show good understanding of the language and protocols.</p><p align="left">An emphasis on the history, culture and place of the kindergarten in the community is enhancing the curriculum. Through place-based education, teachers are making meaningful connections between the kindergarten, children and the world. The construction and display of whakapapa panels in the grounds is one of the initiatives that has involved families and strengthened links with the local community. Toi ngungu, a philosophical cloak, embodies and graphically illustrates the special qualities of this kindergarten and gives insight into the people who have contributed to its culture.</p><p align="left">The morning programme strongly reflects a view of children as competent directors of their own learning. Many aspects reflect philosophical values. Children have freedom to make choices about their participation, use of resources and adult collaboration. Activities mostly stem from their emerging ideas and investigations. Literacy and mathematics are well resourced and integrated in meaningful ways. Children&rsquo;s creativity and self expression are encouraged.</p><p align="left">An effective approach supports children and their families&rsquo; transition to primary school. Regular liaison with local school personnel occurs through reciprocal visits. Resources provide a range of information for children and adults.</p><p align="left">Photographs and narratives are displayed in a range of ways to inform parents about the programme and provide opportunities for children to reflect on their learning. Individual portfolios provide a rich picture of children&rsquo;s learning over time. Children regularly take opportunities to use these records to revisit their learning. Carefully displayed planning stories record details of special learning themes. A sound framework for evaluation is developing that helps teachers identify the impact of their planned programme on outcomes for children.</p><p align="left">Teachers have a comprehensive and well developed approach to self review. A strong culture of collaborative reflection and use of parental input supports their practice.</p><p align="left">Good practice and innovation are sustained through teachers&rsquo; commitment to staying up to date with research, actively seeking opportunities for new learning and developing strong links with the community to support families&rsquo; participation. Recently they have shared their knowledge with others at a national level and continue to seek opportunities to do so. Their strong team approach provides effective support for programme development and the operation of the service.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p align="left">The senior teacher, teaching team and ERO have agreed on the following priorities. That:</p><ul>
<li>the afternoon programme is reviewed and further developed to better reflect the child-centred ideals articulated in the philosophy</li>
<li>teachers will continue to seek appropriate support and advice in relation to their bicultural journey</li>
<li>constructive feedback based on written observations of practice will be provided to support teachers to achieve their development and appraisal goals</li>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation are further strengthened by teachers more actively: seeking and using parental input; including concepts related to teachers&rsquo; vision for learning; and showing in documentation how children&rsquo;s learning is progressed. In relation to planning stories, that opportunities for children to reflect on their learning are maximised and there is an increased focus on incorporating children&rsquo;s developing ideas and theories.</li>
</ul><h3>Association Support</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p align="left">Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p align="left">The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p align="left">The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</li>
<li>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</li>
<li>a wide range of professional development opportunities</li>
<li>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</li>
</ul><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p align="left">The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</li>
<li>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice as a result of feedback</li>
<li>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</li>
</ul><h3>National Evaluation Topic</h3><h4>Overview</h4><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><p align="left">transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</p><p align="left">children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</p><p align="left">the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs</p><h3>Area of strength</h3><p align="left">Families, teaching staff and other professionals work collaboratively to support children with special needs. Families&rsquo; aspirations for their children&rsquo;s learning are sought and incorporated into planning.

</table><a id="parents-and-community-of-paparangi-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Parents and Community of Paparangi Kindergarten</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Paparangi Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Paparangi Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. A team of senior teachers is employed, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team at this service. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">Teachers&rsquo; strong team approach provides effective support for programme development and operation. Good practice and innovation are sustained through their commitment to staying up to date with research, actively seeking opportunities for new learning and developing strong links with the community.</p><p align="left">Development of reciprocal and trusting relationships with parents is a priority for teachers. Families feel valued and confident their views will be heard and respected. An emphasis on the history, culture and the place of the kindergarten in the community, along with a strong commitment to biculturalism, are enhancing the curriculum.</p><p align="left">The learning environment is well developed and maintained to support early learning. An extensive range of high quality resources, including many natural materials, is able to be freely accessed by children for much of the time. Literacy and mathematics are well resourced and integrated in meaningful ways. Children&rsquo;s creativity and self expression are encouraged.</p><p align="left">Children have freedom to make choices about their participation and use of resources and have many opportunities to collaborate with adults. Activities mostly stem from emerging ideas and investigations. Teachers use some good strategies to inspire interest and participation. Positive guidance promotes harmonious relationships.</p><p align="left">The senior teacher, teaching team and ERO have agreed on priority areas for development and review. Teachers want to further strengthen their approach to assessment and implementation of aspects of the programme and will continue to seek appropriate support and advice in relation to their bicultural journey.</p></html>
