</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rainbow Connection Childcare is governed by a registered charitable trust founded and supported by the Thames Baptist Church. The centre is licensed to cater for 50 children including 12 children up to two years old in two separate, age-based areas. There are 48 children on the roll, including 12 children of Māori descent.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO report the long-standing centre manager has retired. The head teacher is providing effective interim leadership during the process of appointing a new centre manager. The outdoor play areas for children have been upgraded resulting in an increased emphasis on the natural world.</p><p>The centre has made good progress with the areas for development identified in the 2012 ERO report. These related to integrating the cultures of all families into the life of the centre, and more clearly reflecting the values and dispositions of Māori children in learning stories. The centre continues to maintain a high proportion of qualified teachers, high quality ratios of adults to children for babies and toddlers, and quality ratios for older children.</p><p>ERO reviewed the centre in the school holidays when there were small numbers of children attending. The centre philosophy places an emphasis on integrating family and Christian values and fostering the holisitic growth of children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy positive and reciprocal relationships with their teachers and their peers. They are confident communicators and share their ideas and opinions with interested adults. The centre provides an appropriate range of equipment and materials for writing and creativity. This enables children to express themselves and build early foundations for literacy. Older children select books to share reading with teachers throughout the day.</p><p>The diverse cultures and identities of families involved in the centre are evident in meaningful celebrations such as Diwali and Matariki. This contributes to a strong sense of identity and belonging for children and families. The programme includes teacher-led group times and opportunities for child-initiated play. A review of teacher-led routines should focus on increasing the opportunities children have to make decisions about their learning, and to sustain their play for longer periods of time.</p><p>Māori children and their whānau are benefitting from ongoing professional development for teachers. This has increased teachers’ understanding of Māori cultural ways of thinking and learning. Teachers document these perspectives in children’s assessment profiles. Children participate in karakia before meals, share waiata with teachers, and hear te reo Māori spoken throughout the programme. Teachers enact their Christian values and integrate whanaungatanga, aroha and manaakitanga into their practice.</p><p>A variety of learning is attractively presented in children’s portfolio books. These books now need to be readily available to children throughout the day. The books are important tools for literacy learning, and enable children to see themselves as confident and capable learners.</p><p>Teachers are a dedicated, reflective and professional team. They have a strong commitment to providing children and families with safe and nurturing education and care. Examples of best teaching practice are:</p><ul>
<li>conversations using rich oral language and multi-sensory experiences designed to build children’s language skills</li>
<li>teachers listening carefully to children and responding to their cues</li>
<li>consistent use of positive guidance</li>
<li>adults participating in play with and alongside children</li>
<li>playing live music to individuals and groups of children.</li>
</ul><p>Babies and toddlers enjoy a calm and unhurried environment with caring teachers. They benefit from strong and secure attachments with a consistent team of teachers. The programme is responsive and promotes a peaceful atmosphere.</p><p>Teachers work closely with parents and whānau to maintain children’s familiar routines from home. This is contributing to high levels of wellbeing for these children. Babies and toddlers confidently access the uncluttered indoor and outdoor spaces for exploration. There are interesting textures and surfaces for them to experiment with as they increase their skills in crawling and walking. Teachers make good use of the high quality and well-maintained furniture to create interesting, safe and comfortable spaces for infants and very young children.</p><p>The experienced head teacher continues to lead a well-qualified and collegial team through a time of change and restructuring. She promotes respectful and collaborative ways of working, and is increasing the opportunities for shared leadership amongst teachers and staff. The staff are benefitting from her organisational skills and commitment to keep up to date and well informed about current practice. Team leaders give effective support for centre management and operations. They are good role models for teachers, taking on efficient overseeing of the daily programme, shared responsibility for appraisal, and leading aspects of professional development in the centre.</p><p>There is a good understanding of the self-review process. This has resulted in improvements to the environment and teaching practice. The centre philosophy is evident in the life of the centre. The philosophy is regularly reviewed by the well-established team with ideas gained from consultation with families.</p><p>Centre governance continues to be undertaken by trustees who bring useful skills and knowledge to their roles. Recently they have sought appropriate, external expertise for financial management and advice about imminent organisational restructuring to ensure centre sustainability. Trustees provide regular, relevant, whole staff and ongoing professional development for teachers and act as good employers. They maintain a strong commitment to the role of the centre as a service and support for the diverse parent and family community.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Trustees and centre leaders agree that it is now important to review some aspects of governance, management and teaching practice to ensure that they are up to date and lead to ongoing improvement, development and sustainability of the service.</p><p>Ongoing review and development should focus on:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing and updating the trust deed, vision, functions and make-up of the governance model of the centre. This review should also include clarifying the operations, systems and processes for centre governance</li>
<li>strengthening the performance management system to ensure that developmental goals of teachers are monitored and result in improved practice</li>
<li>further clarifying the process for assessing children’s learning. Teachers should consider how they plan to extend and add complexity to children’s learning and development and document this in children’s assessment profiles</li>
<li>increasing the responsibility teachers have for intentionally enriching the programme and environment in response to children’s interests and strengths. All areas of play and a wider selection of equipment should be accessible to children throughout the day.</li>
</ul><p>Attention to these areas is likely to help the centre fulfil the intent of its philosophy and further improve outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rainbow Connection Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rainbow Connection Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>21 August 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
