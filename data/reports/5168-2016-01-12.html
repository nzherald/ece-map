</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - David Henry is located in Tokoroa. It is a well established kindergarten with many connections and links to the local community. Children come from diverse social and cultural backgrounds. The kindergarten is governed by the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust, trading as Central Kids Kindergartens. It is licensed for 40 children over the age of two. At the time of this ERO review there were 50 children on the roll, including 17 who are identified as Māori. Teachers are all fully qualified and a teacher aide and administration person provide valuable support for teachers and children.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review, there has been a change in leadership of the kindergarten. Two new teachers were appointed at the beginning of 2015. Teachers have continued to access professional learning and development to better support children in becoming socially competent. There have been some enhancements to the outdoor environment and there is now greater visibility of bicultural perspectives within the kindergarten. Parents/whānau can view learning stories and kindergarten news on line.</p><p>Teachers have responded positively to the areas for review and development in the 2012 ERO report. They have reviewed the philosophy, and increased the use of observations to support teacher appraisal.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy is reflected in the whakatauki, 'Ngā te atuatanga o te tamaiti hei whakarahi - let the uniqueness of the child guide our work'. Teachers model the values and beliefs of the kindergarten and establish warm, welcoming relationships with parents and whānau.</p><p>The kindergarten is well supported by the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust. The trust’s strategic direction sets out the service’s vision, expected educational outcomes, and values. It also defines the strategies for delivering the principles and strands of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki</em> and for respecting Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The trust’s professional leaders monitor the kindergarten’s compliance with policies and procedures to ensure it meets regulatory requirements and management expectations. Kindergarten teachers have generous opportunities to attend professional development opportunities to grow their teaching and leadership skills.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 8 reviews in the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - David Henry is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children. Children experience a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging in the kindergarten environment. They communicate confidently with each other, their teachers and visitors. Teachers are caring, nurturing and responsive to children. Through their key teacher role, they get to know children and their families well, and sensitively interact with them. They use strategies such as affirmation, extending language, coaching and mentoring to promote appropriate behaviour and engagement.</p><p>Children play independently, cooperatively in small groups, or with support from an adult for sustained periods of time. Children with special learning requirements are well integrated into the inclusive kindergarten culture. Teachers are advocates for children and their families and are committed to their well being. They are skilled at identifying children’s needs and listen attentively to their views. Children are able to make their wishes and preferences known and contribute to decisions that affect them. Transition-to-school processes are being currently reviewed to better support children and their families.</p><p>The kindergarten curriculum offers children a wide range of learning experiences such as interactive learning activities, physical challenge, problem solving and exploration. There are many opportunities for imaginative and creative play and teachers encourage participation in music and dance, science investigations and revisiting learning in the profile books. The environment has been thoughtfully presented so that children freely explore and access a wide range of good quality resources. Literacy and mathematics are well integrated throughout the learning environment.</p><p>Teachers have good access to professional development provided by the trust. Some professional development is accessed independently. Teacher appraisal is in the process of being reviewed to better align to the requirements of the practising teacher criteria.</p><p>The head teacher brings a wide range of knowledge and skills to the leadership position and is building professional capability and leadership in the new teaching team. She positively models respectful relationships and interactions in the kindergarten community. The head teacher is well supported by the professional leader who, in a short time, has established positive relationships with teachers, parents and children. Kindergarten leaders strongly advocate for children and their whānau and foster an inclusive kindergarten culture.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the kindergarten leaders agree that next steps for further development include enhancing the quality of self review and through the use of:</p><ul>
<li>multiple perspectives, research and theory about early childhood education</li>
<li>indicators of current good practice</li>
<li>evaluation in relation to improved outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO recommends that teachers explore ways to extend and enrich learning through deeper investigation and inquiry, based on children’s interests.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - David Henry completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - David Henry will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>12 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
