</table><p>Paterson Street Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Paterson Street Playcentre is a parent-led education and care service located in Hamilton. It caters for children from birth to school age and operates two mixed-age morning sessions per week. The playcentre is licensed for 30 children including up to 17 under the age of two years. The current roll of 16 children includes four who identify as Māori.</p><p>During 2018, the New Zealand Playcentre Federation transitioned from operating with 32 regional associations to become one national body with six regional offices. In the central north island six associations have merged into a regional hub renamed Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island Region that now includes 95 playcentres over a large geographic area. At Paterson Street Playcentre the president is supported by a committee of parent members. A centre administrator and centre support worker are provided by the Federation to assist with session operation.</p><p>Through their national philosophy the playcentre places emphasis on whānau tupu ngatahi – families growing together. They empower adults and children to play, work and grow together and value and affirm parents as first and best educators of their children.</p><p>Paterson Street Playcentre has a positive reporting history with ERO. Since the 2015 ERO review, improvements to the induction process has supported a more systematic way of welcoming people into the centre. Roles and responsibilities have been given clarity, and there has been a strategic focus on increased te reo Māori being used by members. General maintenance of the premises has been kept up to date.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 playcentre reviews in the Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Responsive interactions promote rich and inclusive learning opportunities. Children are encouraged to be independent, confident and competent learners. Their language, culture and identity is visible in displays around the walls of the playcentre. Parents have developed good strategies to support positive behaviour and social competence. Children under the age of two years enjoy a calm and responsive learning space. It is age appropriate and allows for free movement, fostering curiosity and independence. Members are reading and responding appropriately to infant and toddlers cues. Children benefit from learning partnerships that value and affirm the experiences they bring to their learning.</p><p>The playcentre is well resourced and all curriculum areas are visible and accessible. Children lead their own play and make decisions about their learning. Planning, assessment and evaluation identifies children’s interests and develops future plans for extending those interests. A range of assessment tools and support is given to new members to encourage building of knowledge about children’s learning. There is now a need for a consistent approach to assessment. Literacy and numeracy is visible in the environment. The environment is print rich and supports early reading skills. Children benefit from a programme that is focused on enabling them to take risk and challenge through their learning.</p><p>There is a strong focus on building capability of speaking te reo and increasing the te ao Māori world view in sessions. Whānau Māori and their tamariki are welcomed and experience opportunities to have their language and culture affirmed. There is a considered approach to strengthening the bicultural curriculum dimension through the integration of waiata and tikanga Māori into the programme.</p><p>Positive and respectful relationships are promoted across the playcentre between leaders and members. All roles and responsibilities have been allocated and are well established. Knowledge sharing between experienced members and new members and opportunities for professional learning and development are offered. Information is shared with the playcentre community through various means, communication is robust and successful. The centre support worker and the centre administrator provide detailed reports that are leading to improved awareness of quality practice, and building capability.</p><p>The Playcentre Federation’s overarching strategic and individual annual plans guide playcentre direction. Parent education programmes have a focus on building knowledge and understanding of children’s learning and development. Communication and support between the federation and regions throughout the restructure has supported ongoing operations. Current policies and systems are in place until new systems implemented by federation are rolled out nationally. The playcentre philosophy and vision and documented strategic goals have been set. There is now the need to measure the impact of actions taken on outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Members now need to focus on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>using a robust internal evaluation framework to identify and plan for improved outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistency of learning and progress over time in children's assessment, making links to the learning outcomes from the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki</em> and to children's language, culture and identity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve practice the Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island regional leaders should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop and implement strategic and annual regional plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitor and strengthen each playcentre’s understanding of internal evaluation to inform ongoing improvement and systems and processes meet regulatory requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support individual playcentre personnel to robustly report on the progress towards their appropriate strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen appraisal processes to support centre support workers and centre administrators to grow their practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Paterson Street Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>19 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/#nga pou" class="ss-broken"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
