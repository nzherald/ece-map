<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Te Aroha Playcentre continues to be very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. Effective systems sustain the collective capability of members to provide high-quality education and care for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Te Aroha Playcentre is a parent cooperative that provides education and care for children from birth to school age from Te Aroha township and surrounding areas. The centre provides three morning sessions a week, and has a current roll of 23 children, including 10 under two years.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of the Thames Valley/Coromandel Playcentre Association. Families are committed to the playcentre philosophy of empowering children and adults to play, work, learn and grow together. They have received valuable, ongoing, administrative and educational support from an experienced and knowledgeable liaison officer. A high proportion of members are engaged in different levels of playcentre training. A core group of long serving members continue to provide stable leadership.</p><p>Since the previous ERO report, families have continued to provide a programme that is responsive to children&rsquo;s learning and interests. With association support, they have systematically improved the quality of programme planning and practices.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in five early childhood education services within the Thames Valley/Coromandel Playcentre Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Children are capable and confident learners and communicators. They enjoy positive, respectful and caring interactions with a wide variety of adults and children of different ages. Older children are accustomed to setting up the environment and planning, initiating and extending their own learning and play. Children play well with and alongside others. Toddlers are fully engaged in the programme, and constantly learn from the modelling of older children.</p><p>Families foster children&rsquo;s independence and provide high-quality support for the development of language, social and physical skills. They respond effectively to children&rsquo;s aspirations, ideas and care needs. Features of adult interactions include effective use of:</p><ul>
<li>questions to challenge and extend thinking, and to foster problem solving</li>
<li>role modelling to encourage participation and engagement</li>
<li>suggestions to increase children&rsquo;s awareness of possibilities and options.</li>
</ul><p>Children benefit from a high-quality programme that reflects playcentre philosophy and <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, <em>The New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum</em>. They have meaningful opportunities to explore literacy, mathematical, scientific and creative art concepts. Families continue to strengthen their use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori.</p><p>The centre has well-developed systems for documenting how families notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s emerging strengths and interests. Children&rsquo;s portfolios provide comprehensive records of individual progress, interests and development over time. Members share information about all children. They carefully plan the programme and environment to challenge and extend learning and interests. The spacious, attractive and well-resourced learning environment is thoughtfully designed to cater for children of different ages, including toddlers and babies.</p><p>Parents maintain a strong culture of collaboration and support, which has helped them to build their capacity as educators, leaders and managers of the centre. The liaison officer and experienced members successfully inspire and support newer members to take on management and education responsibilities and playcentre training. Parents appreciate the benefits of professional development and training, and many reach higher course levels. High-quality systems of self review and ongoing reflection result in continual improvements to children&rsquo;s learning and centre operations.</p><h3>Agreed areas for development and review</h3><p>ERO agrees with centre priorities to:</p><ul>
<li>develop and implement strategic and annual action plans for improvement</li>
<li>develop strategies to further extend learning for older children</li>
<li>focus more on using displays to make learning more visible for children.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Aroha Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>8 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
