</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Dinsdale Kindergarten is located in the Hamilton suburb of Dinsdale and is licensed for 40 children. The kindergarten offers both full and part-day education and care for children from two years to school age. At the time of this ERO review 61 children were enrolled, including 18 who identify as Māori.</p><p>The kindergarten is one of 29 kindergartens that operate under the umbrella of the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable trust. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement, ‘Our children are strong in heart, head and hand’. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. Advice, guidance and support is provided to the organisation by a kaumātua from Tainui.</p><p>All kindergartens in the Waikato Kindergarten Association are involved in a ‘Cool 4 School’ transition programme, sustainable education, environment and health programmes such as Enviroschools and Sport Waikato 'Under 5 Energise'. The kindergarten's education, operational and administrative responsibilities are supported by experienced association personnel.</p><p>The Dinsdale Kindergarten's philosophy is based on resilience, respect, curiosity and relationships. All learning is valued with a belief in supporting parents and whānau as first teachers. The principles of <em>aroha</em> love, compassion, empathy; <em>manaakitanga</em> respect, self worth, nurturing; <em>whanaungatanga</em> working collaboratively and the strength of the group, are fostered.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in 2014 a new head teacher and two new teachers have been appointed. In addition, the kindergarten has been re-licensed to reflect additional operating hours. Recommendations from the previous ERO review have been effectively responded to.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews in the Waikato Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from effective teaching. Authentic, kind and caring relationships support children to learn. The development of social skills is promoted through a wide range of effective positive guidance strategies. Children’s oral language development is well supported, particularly through opportunities for dramatic play. The environment is thoughtfully organised to deepen children’s thinking and creativity and add complexity to their learning. Children and teachers have fun as part of the learning process.</p><p>Māori children’s sense of belonging is enhanced by high levels of Māori language use and instruction by teachers. Māori knowledge and tikanga are evident in the programme. This could now be further developed with a greater focus on local iwi history.</p><p>Children with additional needs learn in a highly inclusive environment. Teachers are very responsive to the varying needs of these children. They work closely with whānau and external agencies to support parent's aspirations for their children. Teachers use their networks to advocate for children with additional needs as they transition to school. Children’s sense of belonging is nurtured during transition into and out of the kindergarten.</p><p>Children experience a broad and responsive curriculum that promotes positive learning outcomes. Strong reciprocal relationships are formed with each whānau to support children’s learning. Children benefit from a curriculum that develops their knowledge and understanding, particularly in areas such as environmental sustainability, the importance of physical activity and healthy eating along with foundation skills in mathematics and literacy. The indoor and outdoor environment is well-resourced with appropriate levels of challenge. There is a good balance between teacher-directed and child-initiated play and learning.</p><p>Individualised planning in collaboration with whānau is becoming embedded. Teachers are strengthening their use of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> Early childhood curriculum to recognise and respond to learning. Assessment clearly recognises children’s learning and is increasingly showing individual children's progress over time.</p><p>Leadership effectively promotes a shared understanding of the philosophy, vision and goals of the kindergarten. The philosophy is a living document, regularly reviewed and well enacted. Leaders have developed a culture of innovation for improvement, collaboration and critical reflection. Leadership is contributing to equitable outcomes for all children.</p><p>Education services managers (ESMs) work closely with the head teacher and provide well-informed professional leadership to support kindergarten operation. The WKA has recently reviewed its teacher appraisal process. Ensuring this new process is fully implemented is now a priority for ESMs.</p><p>The WKA provides sound, comprehensive systems, policies and procedures to guide kindergarten practice. Teachers have access to ongoing and targeted professional development to promote improved practice and contribute to positive outcomes for children. ESMs work closely with the head teacher and provide well-informed professional leadership to support kindergarten operations.</p><p>Effective governance by the WKA is contributing to inclusive and equitable services for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for leaders and teachers to effectively meet the learning needs for children is to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to embed individualised planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to implement the <em>Te Whāriki</em> curriculum with a focus on localising the curriculum.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Dinsdale Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Dinsdale Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>20 December 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
