</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ashridge Road Playcentre is located in Napier. The centre is open for four morning sessions a week. One session per week is specifically for children over the age of three years. The centre is licensed for 25 children, including 15 children up to two years of age. Parents stay with their children.</p><p>The centre is managed as a parent cooperative with support from experienced personnel from the Hawkes Bay Playcentre Association (the association).</p><p>Members support each other and learn together. All parents have, or are working towards a playcentre qualification. Some members have a long association with the centre and continue to support it.</p><p>The association has addressed the areas for development identified in the November 2013 ERO report. It has defined the roles and responsibilities of the executive committee to provide better support for individual playcentres. Procedures for the employment of paid staff have been developed and implemented. These include police vetting and appraisal.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven in the Hawkes Bay Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy emphasises the importance of empowering whānau to learn and grow alongside each other and for tamariki to grow into strong, confident learners through their self‑initiated play. These aspirations are is highly evident in practice.</p><p>A sense of belonging for children and parents is strongly evident. Children actively engage in a range of learning activities linked to their interests and strengths.</p><p>The well-resourced environment provides children with choices, allows them to explore, investigate and engage in creative and physical play. Literacy, mathematics and science are well integrated into activities. Excursions into the community, and to other playcentres, provide further learning opportunities.</p><p>Routines are responsive to the needs of individual children. They provide social and learning opportunities for children and adults.</p><p>The curriculum is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and the service philosophy. It is responsive to individual children's interests, strengths, needs, and ages and stages of development.</p><p>Members have established a comprehensive system and process for documenting and making visible, children's learning. This supports continuity of planning from one session to another.</p><p>Experienced member's model and support new parents to write learning stories. The centre has identified that continuing to build understanding and capability to assess children's learning is a priority. ERO agrees.</p><p>Profile books are attractive. They reflect and celebrate children's learning, development and engagement in centre activities.</p><p>The centre has developed strong reciprocal relationships with the local school. Participation in the session for older children encourages independence and contributes to a seamless transition for children from playcentre to school.</p><p>Members with young children are well supported to attend to the needs of their infants in the caring and nurturing environment. They access a good range of age-appropriate resources to support their children's learning and development.</p><p>Positive relationships and respectful practices support parents of children with additional learning needs to participate in the programme and learn alongside other children.</p><p>A commitment to implementing bicultural practices is evident. Te ao Maori is reflected in the environment, resources and centre operations. Puriri Whakamaru o Heretaunga is an association initiative which provides support to Māori whānau attending playcentre and guidance to individual playcentres to strengthen their understanding of te ao Māori.</p><p>Emergent leadership is fostered. The collaborative approach to managing the centre values parents' knowledge and skills. Support for undertaking roles within the playcentre is well considered.</p><p>A framework for the appraisal of paid team members has been developed. The association continues to support the playcentre with its implementation.</p><p>Members are focused on improving outcomes for children and adults attending the centre. They have strengthened their knowledge and understanding of self review to support this. A well‑established process is in place.</p><p>Members acknowledge the need to continue to build internal evaluation to build capacity and capability to support continuous improvement and sustainability and measure the impact of their practices on children's learning.</p><p>The association has put in place sound systems and processes to provide ongoing centre support until the national restructure of playcentre has been completed.<b> </b></p><h3>Key Next Steps Key Next Steps</h3><p>Members and ERO have agreed that there is a need to continue to build capacity and capability in:</p><ul>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ashridge Road Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p><strong>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</strong></p><p>The next ERO review of Ashridge Road Playcentre will be in three years. </p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>17 November 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
