</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Children at Little Sparrows Educare are involved in creative and imaginative play that engages them in learning. High-quality nurturing relationships are evident between teachers and children. Parents and children are warmly welcomed each day and are well informed about centre values and their children’s health and wellbeing.</p><p>The centre philosophy reflects the aspirations of all staff, parents and whānau. It aims to provide an inclusive culture that affirms the identity of children and makes provision for their wellbeing. Regular and frequent self review includes consultation with parents, changes to resourcing, and a focus on teacher practice and centre routines.</p><p>The director, centre manager and head teacher have set clear expectations for teaching practice. They are a strong team and are focused on the wellbeing of children.</p><p>Little Sparrows Educare was established in 2014,is located in Hamilton East, and has permission to use the grounds of Southwell school. The service is a new privately owned, purpose-designed facility that caters for children from birth to school age. Little Sparrows Educare has a full licence, three fully qualified teachers, two provisionally registered primary school teachers, and untrained personnel who are currently undertaking aspects of early childhood training.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Babies and toddlers are well integrated into the programme. The contribution babies and toddlers make to relationships in the centre is significant. Their responsiveness to their brothers and sisters, as well as other children and adults, is reciprocated and mutually beneficial for all. These crucial and early relationships promote nurturing respectful behaviours among babies, toddlers and young children. Teachers carefully monitor babies and toddlers to ensure that their specific needs are met and home routines are followed as much as possible.</p><p>A collaborative process of self review is a feature of centre development. This approach is particularly evident in a review and re-organisation for babies, toddlers and young children. The process involved gathering, collating and analysing information from parents/ whānau and staff. As a result the successful implementation of a mixed-age programme within the service has had significant impact on tuakana/teina relationships. The benefit for children is a more natural whānau (family) approach, which contributes to positive relationships across age groups.</p><p>The establishment of a mixed-age teaching and learning environment has encouraged teachers to share their observations and knowledge more openly, and together plan strategies to more effectively extend children’s interests. This reflective approach is contributing to the consistency of teaching in the centre and promotes children’s learning.</p><p>Young children’s learning is clearly identified by teachers. The mutually caring and trusting relationships with children are inclusive, supportive and well considered, particularly for children with additional learning needs. High value is placed on activities that promote learning, and effectively use a wide range of strategies to foster children’s cooperative play, self management, independence and choice.</p><p>The centre manager and senior teacher have established an inclusive leadership style that encourages and supports teachers to work collaboratively to meet the diverse and emerging learning needs of children. They have set clear and high expectations for positive educational outcomes for all children. These are well communicated to parents and whānau.</p><p>The programme of learning through play acknowledges the strengths of all children. It provides a purposeful and meaningful framework for the integration of literacy, mathematics and te reo and tikanga Māori. Children have a strong sense of belonging and confidently engage in play activities that extend their learning.</p><p>The centre programme is focused on providing meaningful and interesting opportunities for children. They enjoy playing and learning in natural and stimulating environments that support their curiosity, exploration and culture. The learning environment invites children to investigate, challenge and participate in activities that promote their thinking and physical skills. Children are actively engaged in pursuing their individual interests through play for sustained periods of time.</p><p>Teachers document children’s learning in portfolios and suggest possibilities based on children’s interests. Children frequently revisit their areas of learning and are self-motivated to extend their interests. In addition, the neighbouring school provides young children who are about to transition to school with a range of opportunities to familiarise themselves with their future learning journey.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>A review of the centre’s strategic plan so that it includes goals based on current review priorities and practices is likely to provide clearer directions for centre development. Specific consideration should be also given to the overall quality of teaching and learning, and the monitoring of children’s progress over time.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Sparrows Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‘have’ or ‘have not’ taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Sparrows Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>27 May 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
