</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Cambridge Kindergarten is located in Cambridge and provides sessional education and care for children from two years to school age. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 40 children over the age of two years at any one time. At the time of this ERO review, 80 children were enrolled, of whom five are identified as Māori.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable trust, and does not operate for profit. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement, ‘Every child reaching their full potential’. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. All kindergartens provide an <em>Enviro-School</em> focus as a key curriculum feature to encourage children to better understand caring for the environment.</p><p>The Educational Service Manager (ESM) monitors and reports to the association on the kindergarten’s quality of education. A kaumātua from Tainui provides advice, guidance and support about Māori language, culture and identity. The kindergarten’s administrative responsibilities are well supported by association resource personnel.</p><p>The kindergarten benefits from the WKA's clear guidelines and expectations for practice and the availability of good self-review processes for monitoring and evaluating the quality of education and care it provides for children.</p><p>The qualified teaching team of four includes the experienced head teacher and three other teachers who have joined the team since the 2011 ERO review. Since that time, teachers have continued to refine assessment processes, strengthen bicultural perspectives and enhance the learning environment. The kindergarten has also celebrated its 50th anniversary with the wider community.</p><p>Teachers aim to provide a warm, welcoming and culturally inclusive environment that fosters child-initiated learning and exploration, and supports children to care for themselves, others and the environment.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 12 kindergarten reviews in the Waikato Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Cambridge Kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Children are capable, competent and independent learners. They are enthusiastic, adventurous and confidently engage in complex child-led learning. Children confidently communicate ideas and opinions and display well-developed social skills. Children are highly creative and skilled at using tools and materials to achieve their ideas. They demonstrate a strong sense of belonging, humour and enjoyment of learning.</p><p>Teachers' relationships and interactions with children and their families are trusting, respectful and caring. They make good use of learning conversations to extend children’s thinking and communication skills. Teachers respond enthusiastically to children’s emerging interests and experiences outside of the kindergarten. They place a strong emphasis on supporting children to plan and develop strategies to achieve their ideas. Teachers value and affirm children’s independence, strengths and capabilities.</p><p>The holistic and inclusive curriculum is well-designed to promote high-quality learning outcomes for all children. Strengths include the integration of literacy, mathematics and natural science throughout the programme and the use of computer technologies to support learning. Teachers effectively integrate bicultural perspectives. Flexible routines and regular celebrations, trips and community events also enrich children’s learning.</p><p>The spacious and well-designed environment has a positive impact on children’s learning. Teachers skilfully resource and present the environment to stimulate children’s curiosity and invite investigation and exploration. Children have independent access to an abundant variety of high-quality materials and equipment. The environment provides extensive opportunities for children to engage in imaginative play, make choices, and to extend their physical capabilities. Teachers provide meaningful and practical ways for children to learn about sustainability and caring for the environment.</p><p>Strong partnerships between the teaching team, parents and the wider community are key factors in the kindergarten’s ongoing success and sustainability. Parents are very satisfied with the service that the kindergarten provides. Teachers keep parents well informed about their children’s education and learning through displays and learning folders. Children enjoy revisiting and sharing their learning and success with others. Teachers are exploring strategies, including the use of e-portfolios, to enhance their sharing of learning with families.</p><p>The experienced head teacher continues to provide effective professional leadership with the support of ESM’s knowledge and experience. The recently reviewed kindergarten philosophy reflects the new teaching team’s strong and united commitment to child-centred learning. Teachers work collaboratively making effective use of their diverse strengths, interests and specialist knowledge to enhance children’s learning. The team also makes effective use of self review and professional learning and development to sustain ongoing improvement and build their teaching practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the teaching team agree that there would be benefits in teachers reviewing assessment and planning processes. Particular focus on developing ways to further reflect children’s culture and identity and parents' contributions to portfolios is likely to have positive outcomes for children’s learning and development.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Cambridge Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Cambridge Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>13 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
