</table><p>Waverley Street Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waverley Street Kindergarten is situated in Nelson. It provides all-day education and care for up to 43 children aged over two years. At the time of this ERO review, six of the children enrolled identify as Māori.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy emphasises children's rights, empowering them to think, explore, contribute, grow in confidence and ability, and develop a view of themselves as capable learners.</p><p>Most teachers are fully qualified. Day-to-day operation of the centre is led by the head teacher, who supports the teaching team. Since the May 2013 ERO evaluation, the outdoor learning space has been developed to further support and extend children's learning.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Enviroschools programme. This promotes environmental sustainability.</p><p>Waverly Street Kindergarten is governed and managed by the Nelson Tasman Kindergarten Association (the association). Since the May 2013 ERO reviews, a new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has been appointed. The CEO and a board of trustees are responsible for the governance of the kindergarten. A team of senior education advisors (SEA) oversees and supports professional practice.</p><p>ERO's previous report identified the following key next steps for this kindergarten. These included: enhancing assessment documentation, strengthening the quality of the interactions with children and building teachers' internal evaluation capability. Progress in these areas is ongoing.</p><p>The ERO reviews undertaken in 2018 identified next steps for the board. These included: improving their planning to support the achievement of the board’s strategic objectives; and ensuring that reporting is evaluative and focuses on outcomes for children. These remain priority areas for development.</p><p>This review was one of five in the Nelson Tasman Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers work alongside children using a range of strategies to support and extend their learning. Children’s independence and social competence are actively promoted through respectful teacher practice.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are identified and effectively supported in the programme. Leaders and teachers work alongside their family and whānau to access the external agencies when required. Supporting these children and their whānau to ensure they are well included in the programme is a kindergarten strength.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have recently revisited their kindergarten’s philosophy to determine what learning matters here. It is time for the kindergarten to consult more widely with parents, whānau Māori and their Pacific community to determine what educational success looks like for them in this context.</p><p>Te ao Māori concepts are valued, promoted and evident in the programme. Teachers have engaged in purposeful professional learning and development to support their understanding and implementation of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori. Māori atua and planned excursions to local places of significant value to Māori are enriching the learning programme.</p><p>Group planning provides a shared focus for the kindergarten. It has been responsive to parent feedback and enhances the programme. Teachers should develop specific learning outcomes that, inform teacher practice and possible next steps of learning for children, and are regularly evaluated.</p><p>A recent focus on promoting diversity within the kindergarten has resulted in parents sharing their cultural backgrounds. Teachers are committed to using this knowledge within the programme. Continuing to celebrate children’s culture, language and identity through assessment documentation is a next step.</p><p>A recent parent survey has provided useful feedback for leaders and teachers. The kindergarten has been responsive to aspects of this feedback and this has helped to inform ongoing improvements. A next step is to develop an appropriate communication strategy to share the findings from the parent survey and intended outcomes with parents and whānau.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are improvement focused. The teaching team continues to work collaboratively with the SEA to build their understanding of evaluation for improvement. Teachers should build on this knowledge, so they can use internal evaluation effectively to measure the impact of their practices on children's learning.</p><p>The board is well informed about outcomes from association-wide strategic reviews and the progress being made to achieve strategic goals.</p><p>The board and association are taking deliberate action to support Māori and Pacific children and children with diverse learning needs. The association has developed strong relationships with community organisations to support children and their whānau.</p><p>Appraisal is supporting growth in teacher capability. The association should update the performance management policy and the appraisal procedure. In addition, they should now introduce the Teaching Council appraisal summary annual report as part of the endorsement process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>consult with parents, whānau Māori and their Pacific community to determine what educational success looks like for them and their children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a communication strategy to share the findings from the parent survey and intended outcomes with parents and whānau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use internal evaluation effectively to measure the impact of their practices on children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waverley Street Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>24 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
