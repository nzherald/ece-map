<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Mokopuna ki Clendon Early Childhood Service is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Mokopuna ki Clendon Early Childhood Service is a new centre that has been operating for just over 12 months. It is one of four early childhood services owned by He Puna Marama Trust, based in Whangarei. The Trust provides an overall vision, philosophy and operational framework for the centre.</p><p>The centre provides a nurturing and supportive environment for children and their wh&#257;nau. Teachers work well to give children a physical and cultural learning experience where children can play collaboratively in a secure and positive learning environment. Children have a lot of choice. They know their routines and enjoy playing with peers and staff.</p><p>The Trust&rsquo;s philosophy is evident in teaching practices that identify the principles of whanaungatanga, manaakitanga, and wairuatanga. The learning programme is significantly bicultural and is delivered bilingually through a M&#257;ori pedagogical framework.</p><p>The centre is well led and well managed. Effective leadership practices were evident during the review. Through the support of the Trust, self review practices are becoming more evident in centre operations.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The centre provides a bicultural curriculum and learning programme that supports children&rsquo;s language, culture and heritage. The curriculum is based on a M&#257;ori framework and has good links to <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, New Zealand&rsquo;s early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Positive relationships with children are evident within a caring, supportive environment. Effective teaching practices are collaborative and responsive to children&rsquo;s abilities and interests. Teachers are observant of children&rsquo;s play and reflect on how they can extend children&rsquo;s interests through play.</p><p>The learning environment is highly supportive of children&rsquo;s developmental play. Displays at child height give children an understanding of numeracy and literacy in te reo and English. Children are aware of their work on the walls and often reflect with adults or other children about what they have done or are doing. The centre has rich, well displayed information about children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Parents are kept informed about their child&rsquo;s learning in a variety of ways, including learning stories, individual and group work displays, children&rsquo;s portfolios, and teachers talking to parents.</p><p>Teachers have developed a good transition to school programme. There is a deliberate focus on developing children&rsquo;s readiness for school. This focus has strengthened the relationship with the school, which is adjacent to the centre.</p><p>The Trust is committed to increasing teachers&rsquo; capabilities through formal professional development that has included curriculum planning and assessment, management and leadership, natural learning play environment, and self review. Good systems are in place to provide external and internal support for these developments.</p><p>Effective practices that impact positively on the governance, management and leadership of the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>a good policy framework</li>
<li>clear expectations for teachers</li>
<li>well managed resourcing and consideration of staff</li>
<li>good support from the parent organisation</li>
<li>a centre focus on developing consistent teaching practices.</li>
</ul><p>Key Next Steps</p><p>The centre leaders acknowledge the need to continue developing:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum planning and assessment, by focusing on the children&rsquo;s individual interests, in addition to group activities</li>
<li>the strategic plan based on the overall vision and philosophy of the Trust, staff and parents, with links to the annual plan clearly identified and evaluated.</li>
</ul><p>The appraisal process is currently under review. Centre managers should now formalise appraisal processes to support the development of staff capability and to ensure the sustainability of the centre. The Trust managers should provide support and monitoring for the implementation of this formal process.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mokopuna ki Clendon Early Childhood Service completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a</p><ul>
<li>potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</li>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>26 June 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
