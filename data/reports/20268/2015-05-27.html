</table><p>Aiga Salevalasi Charitable Trust needs support to develop the quality of the curriculum, teaching practices and the effectiveness of centre management.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Aiga Salevalasi Charitable Trust is a Samoan language aoga amata in Glen Eden. The centre’s philosophy places an emphasis on providing a learning programme based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and promoting gagana Samoa and fa’a Samoa. The centre is governed by a charitable trust.</p><p>The staff comprises two qualified teachers and three provisionally registered teachers. Teachers and managers have recently accessed professional support to develop the programme for children and improve management practices.</p><p>ERO’s 2012 report identified the need for teachers to extend and improve children’s opportunities for learning and establish self review practices. The centre has made limited progress in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Aiga Salevalasi Charitable Trust requires support to improve the quality of the curriculum programme and the effectiveness of the centre.</p><p>Teachers provide opportunities for children to learn through their play. Children have access to a range of resources and to the outdoor learning environment. Teachers encourage the development of children’s social skills and support their physical play. The centre provides a basic programme that now needs to be improved to offer children sufficient challenge in their learning and respond to their capabilities and learning needs.</p><p>Children enjoy positive, respectful relationships with adults and each other. Teachers model Samoan language and should continue to promote children’s use of gagana Samoa. Children are keen to learn and willing to engage with their peers. There are opportunities for infants and toddlers to participate in mixed age play. The separate play area for infants and toddlers could be further improved to provide them with a more stimulating learning environment.</p><p>Teachers plan the programme with a focus on children’s interests. They keep records of children’s progress that parents can access on line. More focused leadership is needed to help teachers embed new practices and make ongoing improvements to the programme for children. It would be useful for teachers to participate in professional support to help them evaluate programmes, to be more observant of children’s learning and to consider their own teaching responses.</p><p>Although the centre has recently developed a strategic vision and an annual management plan it would be beneficial for this planning to focus more on changes that improve the programme for children. The centre manager should also ensure financial practices demonstrate a commitment towards children’s learning.</p><p>There is not yet a sound understanding in the service of how to undertake robust and useful self review to promote quality learning for children. Effective self review could help managers and teachers to make informed decisions and identify priorities for development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers should improve the quality of the programme they provide for children by:</p><ul>
<li>focussing on children’s learning in their planning, assessment and evaluation practices</li>
<li>developing their understanding and use of high quality teaching practices</li>
<li>fostering literacy and numeracy in the context of children’s play</li>
<li>ensuring transition to school practices reflect those outlined in <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum</li>
<li>establishing effective self review processes that include the use of best practice indicators.</li>
</ul><p>Centre managers should strengthen practices by ensuring:</p><ul>
<li>teachers are actively supported to achieve full registration</li>
<li>effective financial management supports programme provision and sustains the centre’s viability</li>
<li>the centre’s strategic plan focuses on improving learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>appraisal processes include specific teaching practices to develop children’s learning</li>
<li>the head teacher is appraised by a registered teacher.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Aiga Salevalasi Charitable Trust completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to the curriculum and health and safety. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>regular police vet of non registered staff</li>
<li>implement an on-going process of self-review to improve the quality of education and care</li>
<li>ensure teaching practices are based on an understanding of children’s learning and development and knowledge of relevant theories and practices in early childhood education</li>
<li>document sleep records for children under two years of age are documented based on checks every 10 minutes</li>
<li>ensure there is safe fall 900mm from climbing equipment</li>
</ul><p>[Education Act 1989, 5.311D to 319 FA/FE]</p><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, (C4),</em> (GMA6), (HS9), (HS12).</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Aiga Salevalasi Charitable Trust will be in within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>27 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
