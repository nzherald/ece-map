</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Treasure Cove Early Learning Centre is a well established, privately owned centre. The centre, previously operating as two Peter Pan Childcare Centres, was purchased by a new owner in June 2013. It is now licensed for 80 children, including up to 25 infants and toddlers.</p><p>The centre has three rooms for children in separate age groups. Each room has its own well considered and thoughtfully presented indoor and outdoor area. Children attend either for full days or for half-day sessions. A high number of teachers are qualified and registered.</p><p>The curriculum is underpinned by the centre’s philosophy which is strongly influenced by the Reggio Emilia approach to teaching and learning and reflects the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>ERO’s 2010 report of the Peter Pan Childcare Centre identified many good practices. These good practices that included effective leadership and management, programme management and responsive, respectful relationships have continued.</p><h4>The Review Findings</h4><p>The Treasure Cove Early Learning Centre is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The centre is welcoming to children and their families. Children’s wellbeing is nurtured through positive interactions and care routines. Systems and practices for helping children settle into preschool, move through the centres' various age groups and transition on to school effectively promote children's sense of belonging and self confidence.</p><p>Responsive caregiving supports infants’ and toddlers’ need for strong and secure attachments. There are comfortable, safe spaces that cater for children who are not yet mobile and for those who are crawling and learning to walk.</p><p>Children are confident and capable learners. They confidently explore a learning environment that encourages curiosity, thinking and creativity. Children are provided with feedback that acknowledges their effort and success. Teachers and children have fun as part of the learning process.</p><p>The programme is responsive to children’s interests and encourages whānau contributions. Good quality learning stories show children’s development and the range of experiences they are involved in. Teachers provide opportunities for children to learn and participate in experiences in the local community. These experiences support teachers to plan programmes that offer children challenge.</p><p>Teachers work well in their teams. They skilfully encourage children to discuss their ideas and to participate in conversations about decisions that affect them. Children have time to make discoveries and investigate ideas that are important to them. Some teachers are confident speakers of te reo Māori and are good role models for other staff. Children are well supported to develop the skills to be lifelong learners.</p><p>The owner, staff and whānau have worked collaboratively to review centre documentation, including policies and procedures. Clear alignment between strategic planning, the centre’s philosophy and management documentation is strongly evident. The review of Treasure Cove’s vision, values and philosophy is underpinned by collaboration and partnership between all parties.</p><p>The owner, manager and staff work in partnership with whānau who value being consulted on matters of importance regarding the centre and their children. The owner and manager could now consider formally reporting back to whānau on how they responded to suggestions for improvement gathered through surveys, questionnaires and other sources.</p><p>The owner has managed change effectively and is focused on ongoing improvement. The experienced centre manager provides strong professional leadership and has developed systematic processes to guide staff and lead centre operations. The owner and manager make good use of internal and external expertise.</p><p>The owner and manager are focused on strengthening the quality of education and care through ongoing, systematic self review. High quality documentation supports these processes and is used to guide centre operations. Strategic planning clearly identifies the centre’s development priorities and provides direction to achieve the centre’s vision of high quality education and care.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner and manager and ERO agree that areas for review and development could include:</p><ul>
<li>regularly evaluating the impact of programmes and teaching practices on outcomes for children</li>
<li>reviewing how effectively staff recognise and respond to children’s language and cultures</li>
<li>strengthening processes for teacher induction, appraisal, and ongoing professional advice and guidance.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Treasure Cove Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Treasure Cove Early Learning Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>20 December 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
