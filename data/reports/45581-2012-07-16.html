<html><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">McKenzie House Early Childhood Centre is a newly established, privately owned service situated in the small town of Carterton in the Wairarapa. It caters for children aged from birth to five years. A feature of the centre is the strong relationships established with wh&#257;nau and the community.</p><p align="left">The programme is predominantly teacher initiated and activity based. Routines for infants and toddlers are appropriately flexible and related to their own needs and rhythms. Teachers&rsquo; interactions with children are positive, nurturing and encouraging. Children are relaxed, confident and happy in each other&rsquo;s company.</p><p align="left">The environment is conducive to children participating, exploring, developing their physical skills and engaging in imaginative play. High quality resources and well-presented displays are easily accessible. Children settle quickly and engage with the programme.</p><p align="left">Parents feel welcome to participate and contribute to the programme and frequently share their skills with teachers and children. A high number of M&#257;ori children have local iwi affiliations. Teachers are mindful of this they introduce mihi and are increasing the use of te&nbsp;reo M&#257;ori in the curriculum.</p><p align="left">Management and teachers regard their commitment to M&#257;ori children and wh&#257;nau as a feature of their practice. Wh&#257;nau participation in the curriculum is encouraged and valued</p><p align="left">Positive and useful relationships formed with new entrant teachers at local schools support children&rsquo;s smooth transition and give families confidence about their children&rsquo;s next step in education.</p><p align="left">The owner/manager is well respected by parents and valued by teachers as a mentor and model of good practice. Strategic planning and self-review processes are developing. Management, teachers and ERO agree that continuing to build self-review capability, including further developing staff performance management processes, should improve teaching and learning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of McKenzie House Early Childhood Centre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atMcKenzie House Early Childhood Centre.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><p align="left">This is the first ERO review of McKenzie House, a newly established early childhood centre. Management and staff have worked hard to develop a team spirit and guiding documents to induct and orientate staff. They have established policies and procedures to promote the well-being of children and adults. Teachers have engaged in whole-centre professional learning and development (PLD) to review how they foster children&rsquo;s social competencies. Teaching strategies that best support and engage M&#257;ori children have also been a focus of staff reflection.</p><p align="left">The programme is predominantly teacher initiated and activity based. Routines for infants and toddlers are appropriately flexible and related to their needs and rhythms. Teachers&rsquo; interactions with children are positive, nurturing and encouraging. Children are relaxed, confident and happy in each other&rsquo;s company. Inclusive practice is evident in teachers&rsquo; strategies that recognise children&rsquo;s different personalities, abilities, talents and interests.</p><p align="left">Literacy and numeracy learning opportunities are integrated into the programme and are part of children&rsquo;s choices. Profiles celebrate each child&rsquo;s involvement and play. Children demonstrate ownership of these records, revisiting past experiences. Wh&#257;nau contribute with stories from home. Teachers encourage parents to share their aspirations for their children and to build partnerships and mutual understanding of individuals&rsquo; requirements. Teachers should also review the purpose of profiles to ensure individual children&rsquo;s continuous learning is made visible. At present these books contain more stories about children&rsquo;s participation in activities and group and centre events, rather than capturing the learning continuity, progression and complexity.</p><p align="left">Indoor and outdoor spaces are highly conducive to children learning, exploring and developing their physical skills. High quality resources and well-presented displays are easily accessible.</p><p align="left">Slightly over half of all children enrolled identify as M&#257;ori. M&#257;ori children and wh&#257;nau are regarded as tangata whenua. Te Wh&#257;riki underpins the curriculum and teachers strive to model biculturalism. A high number of M&#257;ori children have iwi affiliations. Teachers are mindful of this and have introduced mihi, an acknowledgement of iwi and an increasing use of te&nbsp;reo M&#257;ori into the curriculum. Teachers have also engaged in whole centre PLD in biculturalism. They regard their commitment to M&#257;ori children and wh&#257;nau as a feature of their practice. Wh&#257;nau participation in the curriculum is encouraged and valued.</p><p align="left">Children with identified learning needs receive appropriate support and encouragement to maximise their involvement in the life of the centre. Teachers are focused on establishing a setting where all children are positively included.</p><p align="left">Self-review practice is firmly focused on positive outcomes for children. However, it requires further development to strengthen performance management practices to enhance teaching and learning.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of McKenzie House Early Childhood Centre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

It caters for children aged from birth to five years. A feature of the centre is the strong relationships established with wh&#257;nau and the community.</p><p align="left">The programme is predominantly teacher initiated and activity based. Routines for infants and toddlers are appropriately flexible and related to their own needs and rhythms. Teachers&rsquo; interactions with children are positive, nurturing and encouraging. Children are relaxed, confident and happy in each other&rsquo;s company.</p><p align="left">The environment is conducive to children participating, exploring, developing their physical skills and engaging in imaginative play. High quality resources and well-presented displays are easily accessible. Children settle quickly and engage with the programme.</p><p align="left">Parents feel welcome to participate and contribute to the programme and frequently share their skills with teachers and children. A high number of M&#257;ori children have local iwi affiliations. Teachers are mindful of this they introduce mihi and are increasing the use of te&nbsp;reo M&#257;ori in the curriculum.</p><p align="left">Management and teachers regard their commitment to M&#257;ori children and wh&#257;nau as a feature of their practice. Wh&#257;nau participation in the curriculum is encouraged and valued</p><p align="left">Positive and useful relationships formed with new entrant teachers at local schools support children&rsquo;s smooth transition and give families confidence about their children&rsquo;s next step in education.</p><p align="left">The owner/manager is well respected by parents and valued by teachers as a mentor and model of good practice. Strategic planning and self-review processes are developing. Management, teachers and ERO agree that continuing to build self-review capability, including further developing staff performance management processes, should improve teaching and learning.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Joyce Gebbie</p><p align="left">Acting National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Central Region</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
