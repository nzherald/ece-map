<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The service is well placed to embed newly established high quality practices and to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Diocesan School for Girls Foundation Class is located within the grounds of Diocesan School for Girls in Epsom, Auckland. The Foundation Class provides an early childhood education programme for four-year-old girls who are enrolled to start at the school. It operates within regular school hours, in a separate classroom with an attached outdoor area. The class also utilises school resources such as the library, swimming pool and playgrounds. Effective school transition practices are evident.</p><p>The Foundation Class is governed by the school board of trustees. Teachers value the professional support networks provided by school leaders. The two classroom teachers are registered teachers. They work effectively to ensure the programme is underpinned by <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. The programme is also influenced by the Reggio Emilia philosophy that emphasises respectful relationships, and the International Baccalaureate approach to inquiry learning.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of the Foundation Class that was established in 2011.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Children experience a high quality programme. They eagerly and confidently share their knowledge and ideas with teachers and other children. Girls manage their relationships and interactions with others successfully. Routines support their sustained participation in cooperative and imaginative play. The indoor and outdoor areas prompt exploration and investigation and are used creatively. In this environment children are articulate and show a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging. They are very well supported and extended as confident, competent learners.</p><p>A feature of the programme is the integration of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, New Zealand&rsquo;s early childhood curriculum with a Reggio Emilia influence<em>.</em> Curriculum priorities such as real-life learning and making links to children&rsquo;s home and community experiences are clearly evident in programme planning and implementation. Teachers skilfully integrate reading, writing, science and mathematical learning in meaningful ways. They include cultural experiences and languages in the programme and foster art and creative opportunities.</p><p>Teachers engage respectfully with children. They use rich conversations to prompt children&rsquo;s problem solving and critical thinking. Teachers have extensive knowledge of children&rsquo;s interests and strengths. They have established effective strategies for assessing children&rsquo;s learning. Useful curriculum and self-review systems enable teachers to evaluate and continually enrich the programme.</p><p>Parents/wh&#257;nau express a very high level of satisfaction with the foundation class programme. They value teachers&rsquo; good knowledge about individual children. Parents appreciate opportunities to discuss their children&rsquo;s learning, in learning portfolios, on the class blog site and in parent surveys. Regular conversations enable families and teachers to implement shared approaches to enhance children&rsquo;s learning. Parents report that they are well informed about, and increasingly involved in, the centre programme.</p><p>The lead teacher promotes effective professional and shared leadership practices. School leaders recognise and value the quality of leadership and teaching practices in the foundation class. They provide appropriate support to foster ongoing improvement, and a high quality early childhood education programme. Effective management systems have been established and school goals adapted to align with the 2008 Early Childhood Regulations.</p><h3>Areas for development and review&nbsp;</h3><p>To enhance existing high quality practices teachers could strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>their use of te reo M&#257;ori, and use the Ministry of Education&rsquo;s resource, <em>T&#257;taiako</em>, as a tool to enhance their understanding of cultural competencies</li>
<li>management practices by monitoring progress against annual and long-term goals as part of their planned self-review each term.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>2 Legal Requirements</span></h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Diocesan School for Girls Foundation Class completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practices teachers should ensure that parents sign accident records.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>18 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
