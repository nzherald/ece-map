<p>Mount Wellington Playcentre is a well established centre in Mt Wellington, Auckland. The centre operates as part of the Tamaki Playcentre Association and offers three family sessions each week. The Association provides an effective framework for centre operations, a parent education programme and a liaison officer who visits the centre several times each term. Centre members are well supported to enhance learning programmes and the environment. Strategies have been implemented to continue the development of t&#299;kanga and te reo M&#257;ori in the centre.</p>
<p>Children settle into the environment easily. They are confident learners who have the opportunity to choose from a variety of resources. Children&rsquo;s wellbeing is promoted and families feel a sense of belonging. Adults actively support children&rsquo;s interests and provide resources on request. Good systems are in place to promote the care and safety of children at the centre.</p>
<p>Since the 2009 ERO review centre members have undertaken significant property development. A dedicated group of parents are committed to the Playcentre philosophy. They work collaboratively and participate in ongoing education to further their knowledge and understanding of their roles and responsibilities in managing the centre effectively.</p>
<p>Centre members and ERO agree that members should now look at using self-review practices to document ongoing improvements in practice. Parents identify the need to further improve children&rsquo;s portfolios so that they provide a record of children&rsquo;s learning over time.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, members of Mt Wellington Playcentre were invited to consider priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and centre members. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atMt Wellington Playcentre.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Since the 2009 ERO review a new group of parents have joined the Playcentre. They demonstrate a strong commitment to maintaining good quality early childhood experiences for children. A good number of centre members hold training certification at various levels and a number of members are in training.</p>
<p>Centre members have undertaken significant property development including the renovation of the kitchen and toilet facilities. They are now ready to focus on further development of the indoor and outdoor learning environments.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p><em>Parent involvement.</em> The new parent co-operative is taking responsibility for the development of the Playcentre. There has been good progress with parents obtaining course-three level certificates to meet the supervisory requirements. Sustaining the good systems currently operating in the centre is an ongoing focus for centre members.</p>
<p>Parents actively support each other during sessions. They share responsibility for the learning and behaviour of all children and provide assistance for those with infants. Good modelling of language helps new parents with conversations with children. New members spoken to during the review feel welcomed to the centre.</p>
<p><em>Interactions.</em> A strength of the Playcentre is the highly respectful, caring and trusting relationships that foster a positive atmosphere for learning. Friendships have been established and children respond well to other parents in the environment.</p>
<p>Parents are responsive to children&rsquo;s care needs. They support children&rsquo;s social development by asking questions that encourage children to explore resources and engage in meaningful conversations. As a result of these good practices, children&rsquo;s sense of belonging and well-being is nurtured.</p>
<p><em>Outcomes for children.</em> Children are engaged in a variety of activities and are supported to be independent in the programme. Parents work and play alongside children to foster their interests and support their learning and development. Adults are becoming increasingly skilled at noticing, recognising and responding to children&rsquo;s strengths and interests. Parents use recently introduced individual evaluation sheets to record children&rsquo;s interests and learning at each session.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p><em>Planning and assessment.</em> Centre members agree that they could now promote more complex learning challenges, especially for older children, by using session evaluations to critically reflect on the quality of children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p>To improve children&rsquo;s portfolios, parents could focus more on showing how children&rsquo;s learning develops overtime. They could also identify how adults might enhance children&rsquo;s strengths and interests in the programme.</p>
<p><em>Self review.</em> Centre members appropriately identify the need to strengthen self-review practices. This could include a stronger focus on centre operations. Centre members acknowledge the need to sustain current good practices and systems. Developing robust self-review processes may support sustainability.</p>
<a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, members of Mt Wellington Playcentre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2>
<p>ERO and centre members agree that parents should continue in their good efforts to improve the quality of the programme.</p>
<a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>

Good systems are in place to promote the care and safety of children at the centre.</p>
<p>Since the 2009 ERO review centre members have undertaken significant property development. A dedicated group of parents are committed to the Playcentre philosophy. They work collaboratively and participate in ongoing education to further their knowledge and understanding of their roles and responsibilities in managing the centre effectively.</p>
<p>Centre members and ERO agree that members should now look at using self-review practices to document ongoing improvements in practice. Parents identify the need to further improve children&rsquo;s portfolios so that they provide a record of children&rsquo;s learning over time.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h4>About ERO Reviews</h4>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h4>Review Focus</h4>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h4>Review Coverage</h4>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h4>Review Recommendations</h4>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
