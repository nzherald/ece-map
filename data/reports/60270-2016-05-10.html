</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Johnsonville Childcare is an all-day centre and is one of three in the Wellington area owned by the same management company. The centre is arranged in two areas, with separate outdoor spaces to specifically cater for the younger and older children. There are two area leaders and nine other qualified teachers. The day-to-day operation of the service is overseen by a team leader.</p><p>Since the June 2013 ERO report Johnsonville Childcare 2 and the adjoining centre, Johnsonville Childcare 1 have merged under the present licence. It is now licensed for a maximum of 75 children at any one time, with 25 up to two years of age. The roll includes Māori, Pacific, Chinese, Filipino, Indian and Pākehā learners.</p><p>The philosophy is strongly underpinned by a focus on respect for children and their whānau, and encouraging children to take responsibility for their learning and environment.</p><p>An external consultant, in place at the time of the previous ERO review, continues to provide support to develop management and leadership capabilities. Centre staff have participated in a range of suitable professional development to strengthen systems and practices.</p><p>Centre management has responded positively to addressing the areas for improvement outlined in the previous report. Although progress has been made, the key next steps continue to require further development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience positive and respectful relationships with staff. They take the lead in their play and are highly engaged in spontaneous and planned activities. Teachers use a range of teaching strategies and practices that respond to interests and strengths. They effectively support and guide children to achieve their goals.</p><p>There is a positive and calm tone in the centre. Children use a range of appropriate resources to engage in active play. The newly refurbished outdoor play area for the older children provides opportunities for physical challenge. Mathematics and literacy experiences are successfully promoted in the programme. Teachers seek and value whānau contributions, sharing information with them in a variety of ways.</p><p>Responsive care is consistently evident, particularly in the nursery area for children aged up to two years. The planned review to establish a separate philosophy should be useful to guide teachers' practice for this age group. Teachers need to continue to build specific skills and knowledge related to infants and toddlers.</p><p>Children's diversity is respected and celebrated. Staff are inclusive and the service enjoys a high level of parental involvement in activities and events. How well te ao Māori is reflected in the curriculum continues to be an area requiring further development. ERO affirms the plan to provide professional development that builds staff capability in responding to Māori learners. Including <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em> as part of the appraisal process should support this planned development.</p><p>Curriculum planning and evaluating its effectiveness need improving. Limited progress has been made in response to the previous ERO report that identified these areas for development. Teachers and leaders should continue to strengthen their understanding of assessment and planning, and the impact of teaching practices on children's learning.</p><p>Children's portfolios are an attractive record of their experiences at the centre. Recent review has assisted leaders and teachers to clarify the purpose and content of learning stories about children. Recently-developed guidance should improve their recording of learning and progress.</p><p>An external provider has effectively supported leadership development. The team leader is growing her capacity to make curriculum decisions and manage personnel. Continued support is necessary to further strengthen capability in these areas. Building leadership effectiveness across the centre is also a next step.</p><p>Systems are in place that support staff to improve their practice. Teachers collaborate and share good practice. The appraisal process should be further strengthened to improve goal setting and better identify individual teacher's professional development needs. Including opportunities for teachers to inquire into the effectiveness of their practice should support them to improve. Strengthening how they gather and collate evidence should enable them to more effectively demonstrate how well they meet the professional teaching standards.</p><p>The strategic plan needs strengthening. It currently reflects the centre's vison and philosophy and it focuses on improving children's learning. It guides the timings of activities. Further developing the plan to include specific goals, monitoring progress and the evaluation of outcomes should better promote improvements.</p><p>The service's self-review framework has the potential to support effective internal evaluation. Sound evaluative questions are asked and good evidence about practice is being gathered. However further development is required for self review to be fully effective. The next step is to strengthen teachers' shared understanding of self review and fully implement an evaluative process that leads to improvement of practices that promote learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to sustain and improve the centre's performance in promoting learning and positive outcomes for children, management needs to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how well teachers are supported to improve their practice and performance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the quality of teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leadership and management capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strategic planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>capability in effective evidence based internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers' and leaders' capacity to respond to the needs of Māori learners.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Johnsonville Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Johnsonville Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>10 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
