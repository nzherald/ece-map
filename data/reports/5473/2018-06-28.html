</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hanan Free Kindergarten is one of 12 kindergartens governed and managed by the South Canterbury Free Kindergarten Association (SCK) in Timaru. It provides education and care for up to 42 children from two to five years old within a culturally diverse community.</p><p>The head teacher and three teachers are responsible for daily operations and the teaching programme. A teacher aide provides additional support for all children and teachers. Professional practice is supported by a senior teacher. All teachers are qualified and registered teachers.</p><p>Since the previous ERO report in 2014, there have been significant changes to the leadership and teaching team. After a time of change, a relieving head teacher was employed in mid-2017 to provide continuity for children and families. A new head teacher was appointed in 2018.</p><p>The teaching team has made progress with the areas for development identified in the 2014 report. This includes, strengthening internal evaluation systems and more recently, developing assessment, planning and evaluation practices for individuals and groups of children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews in the South Canterbury Free Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten's moemoeā/vision is made up of three values. These are manaakitanga, whānaungatanga and interdependence. The values guide the curriculum and teaching practices. They are evident in the positive and meaningful relationships that teachers have with children, parents and whānau. Teachers provide a positive, welcoming and familiar environment that supports a sense of belonging and promotes the engagement of all children.</p><p>Teachers engage in respectful, relationships with parents and whānau. They support the holistic needs of children and their families. Teachers use parent voice and whānau aspirations to enhance children's learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Teachers know the children well and support them meaningfully in their learning. They respond to the interests, strengths and capabilities of children authentically. Teachers provide children with opportunities to follow their interests and explore the environment and resources at their own pace.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well supported. Teachers work closely with children, parents, whānau and external experts to help children achieve and succeed. Cultural diversity is respected and valued in the kindergarten. A strong focus on whānaungatanga in the programme supports the language, culture and identity of all children. The head teacher and teachers are committed to implementing a bicultural curriculum that is authentic and meaningful for all children.</p><p>Teachers are developing respectful and considered culturally responsive practices. This includes knowledge, understanding and respect for Pacific languages and cultures. For example, a child's cultural background was recently celebrated by deliberately including the child's home language and culture in their learning plan.</p><p>The head teacher and teachers have built strong links with the community to enhance children's learning and to support their transitions into local schools. Collaborative ways of working are fostered with everyone in the service. This approach has helped to increase the social and emotional competence of all children.</p><p>The head-teacher and teachers are using internal evaluation processes to improve assessment and planning practices. A well stepped out action plan is supporting teachers to improve their practices and learning outcomes for children. The teaching team have reflected and challenged their practices through emergent reviews and role-modelling from the head teacher. This has helped teachers to discuss more deeply their understandings of Māori concepts in relation to their moemoeā/vision.</p><p>The SCK philosophy, vision, goals and systems are effectively promoting positive outcomes for children. The board, managers and leaders have proactively addressed the recommendations for the association in the October 2014 report.</p><p>There is strong alignment between the SCK strategic priorities and the kindergarten's priorities and plans. The board is well informed about how well each kindergarten is progressing and contributing to the strategic direction of the SCK. However, the board could know more about how well the kindergartens are improving outcomes for children and how well children are achieving in relation to the association’s valued outcomes (purpose).</p><p>The board is focused on improving outcomes for all children, including taking deliberate action to support Māori and Pacific children and children with diverse learning needs in the kindergartens. SCK leaders have developed strong networked relationships with community organisations to support children and their whānau. The next step for the board is to consider their culturally responsive practice as governors and to consult with whānau Māori to inform the future direction of SCK.</p><p>There are effective systems and processes to ensure that regulatory requirements are met within each kindergarten. Relevant professional learning, improved appraisal processes and effective ongoing coaching and mentoring by the senior teachers are building teacher capability.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">Key Next Steps</span></h3><p>The key next steps for teachers, with the support of the senior teacher are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen internal evaluation, curriculum assessment, planning and evaluation systems, bicultural practices and build on the positive changes to date</li>
<li>further unpack curriculum priorities to clearly identify valued learning outcomes that can inform assessment and planning for children</li>
<li>discuss the potential of reporting to SCK the progress children are making against the valued outcomes (priorities).</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hanan Free Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hanan Free Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>28 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
