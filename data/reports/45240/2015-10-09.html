</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>HBC - Home Based Childcare is located in Whakatane. It is licensed to provide home-based education and care for up to 80 children from birth to school age. Children are placed in family homes with one educator, who can have up to four children at any one time.</p><p>The service is managed by two directors, one of whom is also a coordinator. The quality of education and care is overseen by two coordinators, who are experienced, qualified and registered teachers. Their role is to regularly visit children in educators' homes, and provide leadership that promotes children's wellbeing and learning.</p><p>The service provides flexible part-time and full-time hours to respond to the needs of families. Children and educators have regular social and educational contact with others. They are able to participate in a community playgroup, a music programme, gymnastics and other outings and events in the local community. Children can also attend other early childhood services.</p><p>The service has a positive reporting history with ERO. Since the last ERO review in 2012, staffing has remained consistent and educators have remained with the organisation. Directors and coordinators have made positive changes to address the areas for development in the last ERO report, which included a review of the service philosophy and values.</p><p>Coordinators have continued to access relevant professional development to keep up-to-date with current research in early childhood education. Educators are offered training to improve their knowledge of how children learn. A unique feature of the service is the significant number of educators who are qualified and registered teachers.</p><p>In consultation with educators and families, the service has developed a vision that defines their values of quality education and care in the service. It is founded on the aspirations for children from <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The service believes in supporting children to grow as competent and confident learners, by providing a quality home based service for its community that meets the needs of parents/whānau diverse cultures and the wider community.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Directors and coordinators are committed to providing an inclusive early childhood education where all children's participation is welcomed and their diverse abilities, interests, and strengths are embraced. Through professional development, they have further enhanced their understanding of ways to be culturally responsive to Māori children's culture, language and identity.</p><p>Educators are supported by coordinators to implement <em>Te Whāriki</em>. Children experience a rich variety of curriculum experiences in the educators' homes and the local community setting. Educators include children in their family life and everyday experiences. Involvement in spontaneous and planned outings ensures children are learning in interesting and meaningful contexts.</p><p>Children benefit from the high level of support provided to educators by experienced and knowledgeable coordinators. The service prioritises and values respectful and trusting relationships among all members of the service. Coordinators support educators' professional practice in the following ways:</p><ul>
<li>they model effective teaching strategies and interactions for learning. Coordinators visit children in the home, participate in community playgroups organised by the service, and encourage educators to use the community environment to provide authentic learning opportunities</li>
<li>encouraging educators to reflect on their practice through regular documented feedback, by providing readings to develop understanding about how children learn, and by setting goals for ongoing professional learning</li>
<li>offering educational resources and equipment to further extend children's learning.</li>
</ul><p>The service acknowledges parents as the first educators of their children. It empowers educators to respond to the aspirations of parents and to involve families in the educational programme. Coordinators keep parents well informed about children's experiences in home-based care and share learning stories with families to celebrate children's success in learning.</p><p>The service provides positive learning outcomes for children. Management has established many effective systems, process and practices to ensure health and safety legislation requirements are met. This includes providing educators with a good range of resources to ensure the services high expectations for education and care are followed. They have established systematic practices to inquire into their practice and focus on outcomes for children's wellbeing and learning.</p><p>Directors and coordinators work as a collaborative team and there is a shared understanding for the vision and future direction of the service. Educators' strengths are valued and they take on many leadership roles. Educators with expertise share their knowledge, skills and understandings through learning workshops and networking with others. One educator contributed her research about ways to support the learning of infants and toddlers, and another provided coaching in te reo Māori.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, directors and coordinators agree that next steps for ongoing development are to use the service's strategic self-review processes to:</p><ul>
<li>align the appraisal process for coordinators' with the Education Council's Professional Teaching Criteria (PTC)</li>
<li>develop individual on-line e-portfolios to enhance family access to children's assessments.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of HBC - Home Based Childcare completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><p>• curriculum• premises and facilities• health and safety practices• governance, management and administration.</p><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of HBC - Home Based Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>9 October 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
