</table><p>Allenton Free Kindergarten is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Allenton Kindergarten is one of five kindergartens administered by the Ashburton Kindergarten Association. A manager oversees the association under the governance of a board. An education service manager (ESM) provides advice and guidance to teachers on the curriculum and programme. The head teacher manages the day-to-day operation of the kindergarten. The kindergarten provides for the education and care of children from two years old until school age. Many children in the kindergarten reflect the cultural diversity of the community. Managers and teachers have a vision that children will develop social and managing skills to support their learning in a safe and respectful environment.</p><p>The managers and teachers have addressed the areas for development outlined in the March 2011 ERO report.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews in the Ashburton Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>ERO observed children actively engaged in learning as individuals or in small groups. They have friendly and respectful interactions with others. They willingly shared ideas and invited others to join in their activities. Many children were confidently leading their own learning. They had access to a good range of resources including physically safe and challenging structures in the outdoor environment.</p><p>Teachers show respect for the cultural backgrounds of all children. They make sure children experience aspects of te reo and tikanga Māori naturally throughout their day. Children with specific learning needs participate in all aspects of the programme alongside their peers.</p><p>Children’s learning experiences strongly focus on literacy, numeracy, science and inquiry. Teachers value and respond positively to children’s ideas and opinions. They encourage children and their parents to contribute to the learning stories. Teachers are beginning to use the association’s indicators of good practice to identify the things they do that best supports children’s learning. These indicators have also been useful in the assessment of children’s learning. Teachers celebrate what children know and show a keen interest in what they enjoy doing. A greater focus on how well children attain the skills for learning will inform parents about how they can extend on this learning, at home.</p><p>To further strengthen the quality of their planning and assessment, teachers should develop a clear and consistent process for:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>identifying individual children’s learning within group planning and activities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>showing how assessment informs programme planning and resourcing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identifying the teaching strategies that add value to children’s learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Parents are warmly welcomed into the centre. They regularly contribute ideas to, and participate in, the centre’s curriculum. The managers and head teacher make good use of the feedback from children, teachers, parents and whānau when considering improvements to the centre’s programme. The next step is to develop ways to more explicitly monitor the impact of changes to practices made as a result of self review.</p><p>The association has a new board that is yet to be fully trained in its governance role. The manager agrees that the board needs to develop long-term plans to support the kindergarten’s vision and future direction.</p><p>The appraisal process effectively identifies and affirms good practice. However, some aspects could be further strengthened so that there is a clearer indication of next steps that will lead to improved teacher practice.</p><p>The kindergarten association has a comprehensive policy and procedure framework in place to provide good guidance for kindergarten operations and the monitoring of health and safety. Association goals are well known by all staff. These appropriately include a goal focused on promoting leadership. Since the 2011 ERO report, the association has improved the quality of the information the manager receives about the effectiveness of each kindergarten’s programme. The association's initiative of employing a speech language therapist to work with identified children is resulting in improved learning outcomes for some children and providing helpful additional support for families and teachers. Another useful initiative to support children’s participation in early childhood education is the association’s ‘no fees’ policy.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers and teachers have a strong focus on improvement. ERO and the managers agree with the following areas for review and development:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further strengthening the quality and consistency in planning and assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the appraisal process and monitoring and reporting the impact of changes to practice on outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The new board has identified that board members require further training to familiarise themselves with their roles and responsibilities, and to further develop the following areas of governance:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>association strategic planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the board’s role in supporting kindergartens to respond to priority learners within their communities, such as the growing populations of children and families from Māori and Pacific backgrounds and children who do not have English as their first language.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Allenton Free Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Allenton Free Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>29 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
