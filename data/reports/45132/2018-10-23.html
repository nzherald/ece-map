</table><p>Edukids Delamain is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edukids Delamain operates under the BestStart Educare Ltd management structure. BestStart is a large national organisation which owns early childhood centres across Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>The centre is licensed to provide education and care for 100 children, including up to 25 children under two years of age. The teaching programme is organised across four separate rooms, with different age groups in each room. Each room has a connected outdoor play area, with those children over three years sharing a play space with children from the preschool room. The centre is purpose built.</p><p>A centre manager (CM) oversees the day-to-day operation of the centre. Head teachers lead the programmes and practices in each room. A BestStart business manager (BM) and professional services manager (PSM) visit regularly to support the service. Most staff are trained early childhood teachers. A new CM was appointed in 2016. Since the 2015 ERO review, there have been some staff changes.</p><p>The centre's vision is, 'Children are at the centre of all that we do.' The philosophy is currently undergoing review. The centre's philosophy places importance on partnerships with parents, valuing children's cultures, respectful interactions and Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and the role of routines to support a sense of belonging.</p><p>Since the 2015 ERO review, the centre has made good progress towards addressing all of the areas identified for development. Improvements have been made to programme planning and identifying specific of teaching strategies. There is greater consistency of practices across the classrooms and increased valuing of different cultures in the learning programme and environment. Some areas for improvement identified in the 2015 ERO report require continued strengthening, as outlined in this report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s interests, strengths and dispositions underpin assessment, planning and programme provision. Children readily contribute ideas to group plans. Teachers extend children's learning by engaging their curiosity and helping them seek answers to their questions.</p><p>There are many good examples of assessment and planning for individuals. These examples clearly identify children's learning goals, specify teaching strategies to support the achievement of the goals, and show the child's progress towards attainment of these. Teaching strategies are evaluated for effectiveness.</p><p>Children under two are cared for and nurtured by teachers who are quick to notice and respond to them. Care routines are respectful and responsive to the natural rhythm of babies, infants and toddlers.</p><p>Leaders and teachers foster positive relationships and a culture of care across the centre. There is collaboration and connectedness between the four classrooms. Planned opportunities for all children to interact contribute to their sense of belonging. Transition processes into and, within the centre, and on to schools are thoughtfully considered.</p><p>Teachers are inquiring into their practice to deepen their knowledge base and continually improve outcomes for children. The best examples demonstrate an increasing level of reflection and critical thought about how to best meet the needs, interests and strengths of children. This can be seen in the way teachers are:</p><ul>
<li>using a range of useful strategies to support children with additional needs</li>
<li>empowering children's independence and confidence through positive interactions and engagement in learning with, and alongside , their peers</li>
<li>being more intentional about seeking parent and whānau aspirations for their children</li>
<li>beginning to explore the concept of Māori success as Māaori</li>
<li>showing greater awareness of children’s cultural backgrounds, particularly for children with Māori or Pacific heritage.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders are effectively building consistent practices between rooms. There is strong focus on building a cohesive teaching team, leadership capability and sustainable practices across the four classrooms. This is promoting a professional environment and shared conversations about teaching and learning. Appraisal is robust providing teachers with affirmation and challenge to support their teaching practice.</p><p>Well-established quality assurance systems help monitor how well the organisation's expectations are met, and support ongoing improvement. The centre's leaders and teachers work well with the PSM and BM. They benefit from the contributions of the PSM and BM who provide direct feedback, professional learning and development, business management and HR support.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO have agreed that the key next steps for further improvement are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>extend knowledge and use of internal evaluation, including more effective use of the centre's existing internal evaluation framework</li>
<li>empower children to take a greater lead in their own learning</li>
<li>be more deliberate about making connections to te ao Māori perspectives and including these in planning and programme provision.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edukids Delamain completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edukids Delamain will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>23 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
