</table><p>Riverside Kindergarten and Childcare requires development in leadership, teaching practice and clear policies and procedures to support effective assessment, planning, and evaluation leading to a curriculum that responds to and extends children’s strengths, needs and interests.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Riverside Kindergarten and Childcare is situated in Wainuiomata. It is privately owned and caters for up to 30 children aged over two years. The current roll of 27 includes 8 Māori and 4 Samoan children.</p><p>The centre has a welcoming environment, with a strong focus on manaakitanga. A rebuild of the centre occurred in 2013 resulting in a purpose-built, spacious and bright space.</p><p>Several areas identified in the March 2013 ERO report have yet to be sufficiently addressed. These include aspects of self review practice and assessment of children’s learning to inform curriculum planning and delivery. The centre has recently accessed professional development focussing on curriculum development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy each other’s company and socialising with each other. They are happy and actively involved in play. They show high levels of interest and competence in physical play.</p><p>Children are respectful of others, their teachers and the environment. They willingly follow routines and know the expectations for behaviour. Relationships between teachers and children are warm and affirming.</p><p>The service has a clear philosophy and a range of vision statements about management, and teaching and learning. It is timely for these to be reviewed and evaluated to determine what they mean to teachers, and to measure the effectiveness and quality of programmes and practices.</p><p>The centre curriculum is predominantly adult determined. Children engage well in organised activities. Nurturing their skills and dispositions to become self-motivating, confident and curious learners, through use of positive guidance and respectful interactions, is needed. This should enhance children's engagement and sustained play.</p><p>Children’s participation in the curriculum is documented in narratives. At times their learning and progress is illustrated. Incorporating and linking children’s emerging and evolving interests in the world around them with the aspirations of their parents and whānau would enhance planning and assessment.</p><p>Development is needed in noticing, recognising and responding to children’s interests, strengths and needs within the curriculum. The quality of the teaching should be strengthened to better promote children’s understanding, thinking and extension of their interests. This should begin with fostering shared understandings about effective practice, as informed by current research. To become more responsive to children, leaders and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>organise the environment to encourage investigation of materials and sustained engagement in child-led play</li>
<li>ensure that children are given real choices about their participation in adult-led activities and routines</li>
<li>continue to develop effective assessment, planning and evaluation so it informs the programme and better meets the children’s needs</li>
<li>further consider ways to support children's transition to school including developing an understanding of how the <em>New Zealand</em> <em>Curriculum</em>, the school curriculum, links to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</li>
</ul><p>Aspects of tikanga Māori are evident in practice and some adults use te reo Māori with children. Leaders should review how effectively the teaching and learning practices respond to children’s identity, culture and language. This can then be used as a foundation to better understand success for Māori as Māori and for Pacific children.</p><p>At the time of the previous ERO review staff appraisal was at an early stage of implementation. Improving teaching and learning practice still needs greater focus. Strengthened appraisal should include:</p><ul>
<li>specific goals linked to areas of teaching practice</li>
<li>high quality feedback based on observations</li>
<li>building teacher inquiry and reflection.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers need to extend their understanding of the Practising Teacher Criteria and the requirements for appropriate and sufficient evidence.</p><p>Leaders should develop their understanding of review and use of internal evaluation as tools for evaluating practices to inform change and promote better outcomes for children. Leaders agree that the kindergarten’s focus now needs to shift to review and evaluation of the curriculum, teaching and systems to better respond to children’s strengths, interests, and needs. This includes a need to distribute leadership roles and responsibilities to improve current practice and ensure sustainability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for leaders are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop and provide a responsive curriculum through improved teaching practice</li>
<li>implement effective assessment, planning and evaluation practice</li>
<li>sharpen internal evaluation practice and develop a systematic approach to the renewal of policies and procedures</li>
<li>review leadership roles, structures and responsibilities.</li>
</ul><p>The supervisor requires support and guidance to develop leadership and knowledge of current best practice through targeted professional development and appraisal clearly linked to effective leadership in an early childhood centre.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Riverside Private Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to the curriculum. To meet requirements the service needs to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>plan, implement and evaluate a curriculum designed to enhance children's learning and development<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008 R43, 1(a) C1-C4, C7-C10]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since ERO was onsite the centre management has developed systems and processes to manage risk for excursions, monitor playground safety and address hazards</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Riverside Private Kindergarten will be within two years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>8 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
