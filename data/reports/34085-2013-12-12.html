</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Thames Coast Community Kindergarten is situated in the coastal village of Te Puru. At the time of this ERO review, it had a total roll of 50 children. The early childhood centre is licensed for a maximum of 30 children at any one time, including 5 children who are under two years of age. Children come from a wide area, including from Thames and northwards along the coast to Tapu. The community includes some families who are resident for a short time.</p><p>The kindergarten has been established for 20 years as a community-based centre, operating under an incorporated society. It is managed by a committee that is elected annually. Recently, a substantial change to committee membership required newly elected members to gain management skills. They were assisted by a previous committee member and a teacher.</p><p>Children up to the age of three are able to attend two mornings sessions a week. Those children who are under two years of age are accompanied by a parent/whānau or a caregiver. On these days, older children attend an afternoon session, and can also attend three all-day sessions. Three fully qualified teachers are employed, of whom two job share.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy emphasises the right of children to high-quality early education and care which meets their needs and those of their families. The kindergarten aims to be inclusive and respectful of all children. Māori language and culture are to be included in the programme.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><h4>The Kindergarten Programme</h4><p>Children are warmly welcomed and find many opportunities to play in a range of learning areas, which are well-resourced for all age groups. There is a strong emphasis on forming cooperative relationships and managing conflict. Shared meal and snack times provide social occasions. This is a particular feature of the younger group session. Parents attend this session to support their children and form networks and relationships with other families. Children become familiar with centre routines, and form friendships with each other.</p><p>The kindergarten values and encourages outdoor play and an appreciation of the natural environment. Small group imaginative play is a strong feature for older children, who cooperate well together and explore a variety of ideas and possibilities. Literacy and mathematics are incorporated naturally in the programme, in a range of contexts. The programme is extended by trips into the community and visitors to the centre.</p><p>Teachers are strongly committed to the community nature of the kindergarten, and maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment. The programme is planned and aligned to <em>Te Whāriki</em> (the early childhood curriculum). Teachers prepare individual development programmes (IDP) in consultation with the parents. They maintain children’s portfolios, which contain records of learning and are shared with parents and children. Photographs of kindergarten occasions are displayed, offering opportunities for parents and children to discuss and share earlier experiences.</p><p>Teachers have been involved in professional developmental in te reo and tikanga Māori and are beginning to include aspects in the programme. Māori children take an active part in the programme. Further attention to recognising their cultural identity in learning stories would make their success as Māori more visible.</p><p>Teachers provide a transition to school programme that develops skills valued by teachers and parents. Teachers and parents consider children make good adjustments to school environments, assisted by the friendships already formed with future classmates.</p><p>The kindergarten’s management committee works closely with teachers, supporting them in their teaching role. They are aware of teachers’ generous contribution to the operation of the kindergarten and its identity as a community-based service with strong links in the coastal area. Newly appointed committee members have a commitment to the sustainability of the service. An experienced member has been elected as chairperson, and together committee members have developed a shared sense of direction for the future. They have obtained expert advice and appropriate guidance to address financial concerns. The committee is supporting the centre’s ongoing operation effectively, and establishing processes to manage the ongoing recruitment of committee members. Regular reports from the head teacher enables the committee to be well informed about the kindergarten’s day-to-day operation and service to the community.</p><p>The head teacher is highly respected by staff, committee and parents. She has developed a teaching team that works well together and has done so over a long period.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers need to review their processes for in-depth reviews of targeted practices. A documented approach to these planned reviews of teaching and learning practice should include:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing the kindergarten’s current practice</li>
<li>researching up-to-date theory and practice</li>
<li>making programme decisions that are focused on improving outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>The implementation of appraisal processes need to be reviewed to develop stronger links between strategic and appraisal goals, professional development and current practice. Appraisal should be closely linked to children’s learning by:</p><ul>
<li>developing personal goals based specifically on outcomes for children</li>
<li>including feedback to teachers based on planned, documented observation of their practice</li>
<li>undertaking relevant professional development and reviewing its influence on teacher practice</li>
<li>continuing to reflect on, monitor and record the implementation of personal goals throughout the year.</li>
<li>Including these points would assist the kindergarten to maintain a coherent and effective focus on improved outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>The kindergarten committee and ERO agree that priority should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>managing finances</li>
<li>planning for effective succession of committee members</li>
<li>considering the employment of a centre administrator.</li>
</ul><p>Achieving these priorities would be assisted by developing strategic goals with plans that specify appropriate outcomes, actions and timelines. This approach would enable the kindergarten committee to regularly track and review progress.</p><h3>Recommendations</h3><p>Recommendations are:</p><ul>
<li>that committee and teachers arrange for teachers to be appraised by an external appraiser in 2014</li>
<li>that teachers and committee undertake professional development in self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Thames Coast Community Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Thames Coast Community Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>12 December 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
