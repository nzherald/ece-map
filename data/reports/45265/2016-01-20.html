</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Superstart Pre School provides full day education and care for up to 93 children, including up to 5 under two year olds. The centre is located in an industrial area of East Tamaki and has two separate rooms known as the Pre School and the Kindy room. Many families travel from a wide geographical area to attend the centre.</p><p>The service’s philosophy prioritises fostering a supportive learning environment and good relationships with parents and whānau. Most children are of Chinese and Indian heritage. Smaller groups of children attending are Pākehā, Māori and Pacific. Some children have English as an additional language.</p><p>All teachers are qualified. The centre owner is currently the manager and has oversight of the daily running of the centre. The owner has recently appointed a new manager who will adopt this leadership role. Centre leaders are the owner and new manager.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO report the business has experienced financial difficulties which impacted on staffing and resourcing. The centre is currently in a better financial position.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report identified areas for improvement that included strengthening self-review, reviewing the learning environment, and programme management strategies. Good progress has been made in strengthening self-review. Other areas continue to be a priority.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s wellbeing and sense of belonging are nurtured through respectful and friendly relationships. Children, including those with special learning needs, are enthusiastic about their experiences in the centre. They are active, confident and interact positively with their teachers and each other. Children’s social and emotional competence is well promoted.</p><p>Children in the Pre School room are 18 months to three and half years of age. A separate space is available for younger children to have quiet time. The owner is seeking external help to review the environment and resources to offer children a better range of play areas. As part of this review, centre leaders could consider how effectively the programme caters for the developmental stages of these young children, as recommended in ERO’s 2012 report.</p><p>Children in the Kindy room experience a semi-structured programme. They have good opportunities to experience literacy, mathematics and science in meaningful ways. The learning environment is appropriately resourced. The spacious outdoor area prioritises environmental education and provides good opportunities for physical play.</p><p>Inclusive practices are promoted. Teachers reflect the diverse cultures of the children and make good attempts to use children’s home languages. Children who have English as an additional language are given good support to learn English.</p><p>Teachers have introduced a computer-based programme to record children’s learning assessments. This e-portfolio enables parents and whānau to view and respond to children’s learning online.</p><p>Leaders intend to improve programme planning, assessment and evaluation processes across the centre. Making this information more visible would invite parents to have greater involvement in their children’s learning. Children, too, would have opportunities to revisit their learning.</p><p>A feature of the programme is the frequent contribution of parents and members of the wider community and their participation in centre events. Cultural events and celebrations of significance such as Diwali and Matariki are well celebrated. Te reo Māori and waiata are used at group times.</p><p>The owner has sourced appropriate professional learning to support the new manager in 2016. She has also sourced an external adviser who will work with teachers during the year and personalise training to the needs of the centre. Professional learning could guide teachers to develop the quality of their conversations and interactions with children to promote better engagement in the programme.</p><p>Self review processes have improved and are continuing to develop. The centre’s appraisal process is comprehensive. Key goals for the centre are identified in the services strategic plan. This plan could be developed by identifying ways to enact these goals. Leaders agree that developing an annual plan would give more focus to specific goals that could be achieved in a 12 month timeframe.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders and ERO have identified key next steps that include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>embed effective self-review processes to increase teachers’ critical thinking and promote positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>improve teachers’ knowledge of how to foster children’s learning through effective assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>develop teaching strategies that extend children’s individual interests and complex play opportunities.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Superstart Pre School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Superstart Pre School will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>20 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
