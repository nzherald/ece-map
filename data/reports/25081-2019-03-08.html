</table><p>Uxbridge Early Learning Centre is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Uxbridge Early Learning Centre is a small well-established community service in Howick. The centre is operated by a non-profit incorporated society governed by a volunteer parent committee. It is licensed for 24 children, including eight children aged under two years. At the time of this review, all children attending were between two years and school age.</p><p>The centre community is predominately Pākehā, with a small number who identify as Māori. The centre has a waiting list and offers families full-day and sessional enrolment options. Most children attend three sessions per week.</p><p>The centre's philosophy and vision guides and underpins teaching practice and all centre developments. The philosophy emphasises the uniqueness of each child and the importance of providing opportunities for children to explore and learn through play at their own pace and in their own way.</p><p>The qualified teaching team is well led by the centre manager. The high number of teachers working with children allows for good quality interactions with children and their parents. The teaching team is committed to supporting children to become independent, resilient, capable and confident learners.</p><p>The centre has responded well to the 2015 ERO evaluation. Governance and management structures have been strengthened. Children's learning opportunities have been enhanced through a redevelopment of the outdoor learning environment, and by teachers further developing children's critical thinking and problem solving skills.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and parents are warmly welcomed into the very well resourced centre. An inclusive and respectful culture is strongly evident. Well planned and managed arrival routines help children to freely access resources and to settle quickly into self-directed play. Children are independent and play well, with and alongside each other.</p><p>The high proportion of qualified teachers and the centre layout give teachers good opportunities to engage with whānau, and to build effective relationships and partnerships with their parent community. A special feature of the learning environment is the recently redeveloped outdoor space.</p><p>Children benefit from the calm, unhurried pace and unobtrusive routines. They engage well with their teachers and with the responsive, child-centred programme. High quality resources and highly engaging activities provide challenging learning opportunities for children to explore, think and problem solve. Children experience extended periods of uninterrupted play that enables them to sustain their learning and interests.</p><p>Teachers respond well to children's interests. They have a strong focus on recognising and celebrating each child's unique identity. Learning programmes align well to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers authentically integrate literacy, numeracy and aspects of science into play throughout the day. Children's regular visits in the community help them to make meaningful connections to their local area.</p><p>Teachers respect and acknowledge children's capabilities and prior knowledge. They use children's interests to plan programmes that add complexity to children's knowledge, and deepen their interest in topics. Teachers offer opportunities for children to plan and lead their learning through play.</p><p>Learning stories and portfolios provide parents with good information about their child's learning and development. Leaders and teachers are now planning to further improve learning stories by including children's next learning steps.</p><p>Children's transitions into the centre and onto school, are very well planned and managed. Leaders and teachers now plan to further strengthen their links with local schools.</p><p>Teachers effectively support children's cultural identities. There are numerous opportunities for children and families to contribute and share their language and culture. Bicultural practices are very evident. Te reo Māori is interwoven through the learning programme, and teachers use te reo Māori in waiata. Leaders and teachers plan to continue to build their knowledge and capability in te reo and tikanga Māori.</p><p>The centre is well managed. A useful three year strategic plan was introduced in 2018. This is now being used by the governing committee and the recently appointed centre manager, to review and monitor progress. The centre manager effectively leads a highly collaborative team of teachers who have a strong commitment to the philosophy and goals of the centre.</p><p>Leaders and teachers use internal evaluation practices well to ensure continuous improvement to children's learning outcomes. Recent and useful internal evaluation has focused on <em>Te Whāriki</em> and on transitioning to school.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that the key next steps for the centre include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>deepen teachers' shared understanding of the revised <em>Te Whāriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make children's dispositions and next learning steps more visible in planning and assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen teachers' knowledge and capability in te reo and tikanga Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen their links with local schools.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Uxbridge Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>8 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed</li>
<li>Well placed</li>
<li>Requires further development</li>
<li>Not well placed</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
