</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Brockville Kindergarten is one of 24 kindergartens operating under the Dunedin Kindergarten Association (DK). It is located in the Dunedin suburb of Brockville next to the school. It provides learning experiences for up to 40 children aged two-to-five years. Children may attend for part or all of the daily six-hour session. Children come from diverse family backgrounds.</p><p>Teachers at Brockville Kindergarten aim for children to be confident, competent, lifelong learners. They aim to do this by providing a fun, nurturing learning environment.</p><p>The qualified teaching team is experienced. Since the June 2012 ERO review, there have been improvements to the building and playground and a new teacher has joined the team. Teachers have addressed the recommendations in the 2012 report and made improvements, particularly in the areas of planning, assessment and evaluation (self review).</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 24 reviews in the Dunedin Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from the nurturing and respectful relationships they have with their teachers. They develop friendships with one another. They play well together and have fun.</p><p>Teachers recognise and value the importance of building positive relationships with families in children's early learning years. This is evident in the way they:</p><ul>
<li>provide family events within the kindergarten</li>
<li>seek parents' wishes for their children’s learning</li>
<li>encourage families to share their skills and knowledge within the programme</li>
<li>sensitively support children and families when they start kindergarten.</li>
</ul><p>The parent committee has recently become inactive. The teachers identified that they should continue to explore other ways to involve families.</p><p>Children learn in well-organised and well-resourced indoor and outdoor play areas. The outdoor area provides children with opportunities to explore and develop their physical skills.</p><p>The teachers have identified what the important things are for children to learn at Brockville Kindergarten. Some of these things are stated in the kindergarten philosophy. It would be useful for the teachers to make other priorities more visible. This may help parents to better know what learning is valued. In addition this would better support teachers to evaluate how effectively their programme and practices support the desired learning.</p><p>Teachers provide a well-planned programme to meet children’s interests and needs. Children’s learning and wellbeing is supported by:</p><ul>
<li>consistent routines</li>
<li>teachers’ clear expectations for behaviour</li>
<li>many opportunities to make choices and develop independence</li>
<li>experiences that involve them working together in small groups.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are continuing to strengthen the way they include Māori perspectives in the programme. They have identified that this is an upcoming area of planned review and agree it is an area of ongoing learning for them. They should include their commitment to New Zealand’s bicultural heritage in the kindergarten philosophy.</p><p>The teachers have developed useful systems for planning for individual and groups of children’s learning. The focus for the group plan arises from children’s interests and particular learning that the teachers wish to support. Records show children have benefited from rich and interesting experiences and additional resources that are likely to stimulate and extend their learning. Learning experiences include imaginative and dramatic play, learning about science and developing their physical skills. All children’s learning is regularly planned for. The profile books are attractive records of children’s learning at the kindergarten.</p><p>Teachers work well as a team. Through a process of self review they are reflecting on the quality and breadth of the programme they provide. For example, teachers have planned to enrich the music programme after identifying they could do better in this area. Self-review practice could be strengthened by having a very clear focus to investigate and by ensuring the indicators of good practice relate to the focus. Teachers should then identify how well their practices match those outlined in the indicators.</p><p>The vision of the DK is to provide excellence in early childhood education for all children. The DK is governed by a board and managed by a long serving general manager. The kindergarten teachers told ERO they appreciated the support they receive from the association and the advice and guidance of the senior teachers.</p><p>The board, general manager and senior teachers:</p><ul>
<li>provide opportunities for parents and staff to contribute their ideas about matters in the association</li>
<li>are responsive to identified needs of children and families within the association and provide funding and support to enable these to be met</li>
<li>have developed a framework to guide their work</li>
<li>take all reasonable steps to ensure safe environments for children, teachers and staff</li>
<li>maintain their professional learning and provide ongoing professional learning for teachers in the association.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Next steps for the teachers, with the support of the senior teacher, are to deepen the philosophy and individual and group planning. This includes strengthening the way they record:</p><ul>
<li>the planned strategies to support children’s learning</li>
<li>the progress children have made</li>
<li>the difference they have made to children’s learning</li>
<li>what they value as important outcomes for children’s learning in the philosophy.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have some ideas about what they want for the future of the kindergarten. Their ideas could be developed into a strategic plan that shows the priorities and actions to achieve the desired outcomes. Related systems such as professional learning, appraisal, self-review topics and senior teacher support could then be aligned to strengthen the strategic focus.</p><p>Next steps for the board, with the support of the general manager and senior teachers, are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to define what excellence in education looks like in the DK</li>
<li>further develop strategic planning to better show future goals and priorities and how these will be achieved in the association and in the kindergartens</li>
<li>ensure that the reports they receive show how well the DK’s vision and goals are met, are evaluative and inform future planning</li>
<li>continue to strengthen the appraisal process and be assured that appraisals are rigorous and consistent throughout the kindergartens.</li>
</ul><p>With the appointment of a new senior teacher it is timely for the board and general manager to review the role of the senior teachers and strengthen systems to ensure consistent high-quality practice across all kindergartens within the association.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Brockville Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Brockville Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>27 October 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <colgroup> <col> </colgroup> <colgroup> <col> </colgroup> <colgroup> <col> </colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
