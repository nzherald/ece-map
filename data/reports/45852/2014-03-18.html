</table><p>The service’s governance and management systems and teaching practices are not adequate. The service requires support to improve the quality of management and to develop consistently high quality teaching practices that promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Li’l Champs is in Blockhouse Bay and was opened in 2012 as a purpose built facility. This is the first ERO review of the service. The centre manager, who is a fully qualified teacher, was employed by the owners to assist with the final stages of the centre’s development including overseeing building, employment of staff and establishing centre documentation. The centre was fully licensed in August 2013.</p><p>Li’l Champs is licensed for forty children including fifteen children up to two years of age. At the heart of the centre’s philosophy is the goal of having children experience a caring and challenging environment where they are able to explore. This philosophy is linked to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and also emphasises children enjoying their learning as they develop skills and relationships.</p><p>The centre has six qualified teachers, four of whom are provisionally registered. Teachers have participated in professional development to do with planning, learning stories and self review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are affectionate and caring toward children. Children enjoy the opportunity to play outdoors where they interact with each other and make decisions about their play. Some children seek assistance from teachers. Teachers plan a good curriculum for infants and toddlers, and families are well informed about their children’s current learning through informative assessment portfolios.</p><p>Parents report that they are supportive of the centre and appreciate the relationships between teachers and their children. Children’s transition into the centre is supported by pre-enrolment visits. The centre is well maintained and children enjoy being there. Parents report that children bring their learning home, especially aspects of karakia, play and song. Centre managers work hard to maintain a clean, efficient work environment.</p><p>Despite the positive aspects of the programme noted above, the centre’s philosophy is not reflected in the curriculum. Older children spend too much time in formal learning as part of the daily routine. Teachers need to be more responsive to children’s interests and understand the importance of play based learning. They should provide more opportunities for complex learning experiences in the context of play, especially for older children. Managers could also find ways to support parents to understand the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em> and the value of child centred teaching and learning approaches.</p><p>The centre managers must ensure that there is sufficient adult supervision to consistently allow children to use the whole environment. Giving children greater opportunity to move freely would help them to engage in learning. Teachers should also provide more opportunity for infants and toddlers to play outdoors.</p><p>Effective, collaborative self review is still in the early stages of development. The centre needs an annual plan with goals to guide ongoing improvements in teaching and learning, governance and management. The centre manager and staff should develop processes for regular reviewing the effectiveness of centre operations and monitoring progress toward planned goals. Better and regular self review should help the centre to systematically build its capacity to be more responsive to children and their learning.</p><p>The staff appraisal system should be reviewed to include the Registered Teacher Criteria. Through her own appraisal, the centre manager identified the importance of leading programme planning. She has established good relationships with her teaching teams. Teachers receive constructive feedback about their teaching from her. These feedback processes are happening most effectively for the teachers in the under 2’s area. The next step is to ensure similar practices are established with the teachers of the older children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers and ERO agree that;</p><ul>
<li>teachers require professional development to establish a programme and teaching practices that reflect the centre’s philosophy and are responsive to children’s learning</li>
<li>a documented process and schedule for self review of the effectiveness of centre operation be developed which includes recorded outcomes that demonstrate improvement</li>
<li>the roles of the owners and the manager be more clearly specified</li>
<li>centre policies and procedures should be reviewed to ensure that practices match expectations</li>
<li>the centre manager requires greater opportunity to work with her teachers to improve the teaching and learning programmes</li>
<li>teachers should be appraised against the Registered Teacher Criteria and appropriate procedures put in place which are reviewed regularly to ensure employees are meeting legislative requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Li'l Champs Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas and ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>minimum adult to child ratios are maintained at all times<em>[Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008, Section 44 (1b) Schedule 2]</em></p>
</li>
<li>an ongoing process of self review is established to maintain and improve the quality of education and care <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6]</em></li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<p>suitable human resource management practices are implemented <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<p>the centre plans, implements and evaluates a curriculum that is designed to enhance children’s learning and development through the provision of learning experiences that reflects an understanding of learning and development that is consistent with current research, theory, and practices in for the older children in the centre <em>[Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008, Section 43 (1a) (1aiii)].</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Li'l Champs Educare will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>18 March 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
