</table><p>Leaps and Bounds Preschool is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Leaps and Bounds Preschool is a privately-owned and operated Early Childhood Centre. The centre provides education and care for infants, toddlers and preschool children in a small, home-like setting. The centre has two separate classrooms and one shared playground.</p><p>Since the last ERO report in June 2010, the centre owner and head teacher have developed some processes to improve programme planning and self review and have made significant progress in documenting assessment. They are committed to the ongoing strengthening of these areas to sustain and build on improvements. Parents are well informed of their children’s individual learning progress.</p><p>There have been some changes to staff in the Pepi area for under three year old children since the last review. The new teaching team work well together and communicate effectively to support the learning and well being of children. Staffing in the preschool area has remained stable and has provided consistency for children and families.</p><p>The centre owner and teachers have a shared teaching philosophy that successfully integrates a blend of Montessori beliefs and <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum. The teaching team is made up of experienced and newly-qualified teachers. A number of these teachers are working towards or have an additional qualification in Montessori teaching.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are warm and welcoming to children and families. They build positive and respectful relationships that foster a good sense of belonging for children that helps them to settle into the centre. Calm routines are consistently implemented in ways that give children a sense of security and support them for what will happen next.</p><p>Teachers notice and respond well to children’s interests. They involve children in conversations that extend their language skills and ideas. Teachers and children enjoy one another’s company and have fun together.</p><p>Children are actively involved in an attractive and well-organised learning environment. They have easy access to a wide range of quality resources including natural materials and Montessori equipment. Visitors to the centre and trips into the community enhance the learning programme offered to children.</p><p>Teachers promote literacy, numeracy, and creative learning experiences in ways that encourage children’s curiosity and participation. They help children to develop independence, respect for themselves, others and the environment. Teachers are developing ways to integrate more te reo and tikanga Māori into the programme.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are happy, settled and secure in their relationships with their teachers. Teachers work with children in sensitive, calm and unhurried ways. Those children benefit from a small group size and a well-paced and interesting learning programme where they have space and time to lead their own learning.</p><p>Transitions from the Pepi room to the preschool classroom are well managed. Children are well supported when they show a readiness for different challenges. The shared playground provides many opportunities for older and younger children to learn from and play with one another.</p><p>Teachers are very responsive to the individual needs of children and families. Parents' views are valued and well used. They are actively encouraged to be involved in the programme and contribute to children’s learning.</p><p>Children with specific learning needs are well supported. Teachers work with parents to plan ways to assist and extend on children’s strengths, interests and capabilities. Teachers have purposeful links with specialist agencies and schools to strengthen the learning opportunities that they provide for individual children.</p><p>The centre is effectively led and managed by the centre owner and the head teacher. They provide good leadership and have high expectations for teaching practices and learning outcomes for children. Teachers are well supported to develop ways of looking at and improving teaching practices, including making good use of professional development. Teachers communicate openly with one another and share information to enrich children’s well being and learning.</p><p>The centre owner and teaching team have developed a positive team culture that is focused on working in ways that benefit children and families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre owner and head teacher have identified, and ERO agree, that children’s assessment, programme planning, self review and some management systems need to be strengthened to support the ongoing improvement and sustainability of the service. This includes further development of programme planning and evaluation by:</p><ul>
<li>making stronger links between long term and yearly planning</li>
<li>building on shared understandings of the course of action and the impact of planned self review</li>
<li>continuing to review and develop stronger appraisal and verification processes.</li>
</ul><p>ERO has identified, and the owner and head teacher agree, that they need to continue to give prominence to bicultural perspectives.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Leaps and Bounds Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Leaps and Bounds Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>5 September 2013</p><h4>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h4><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
