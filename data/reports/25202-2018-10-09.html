</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hunua Playcentre is a parent-led, sessional early childhood education service. It is part of the Counties Playcentre Association, situated in a rural area of Hunua, near Papakura. The centre is licensed for 26 children, including 10 under two years. It offers two supervised sessions per week catering for up to 11 children from birth to school age in a mixed-age setting.</p><p>The centre's philosophy reflects the aspirations of the Playcentre Federation, of whānau and children learning together through child-initiated play. The programme is guided by <em>Te Whāriki,</em> Early childhood curriculum and honours the Treaty of Waitangi.</p><p>The playcentre operates as a parent cooperative run by volunteers and is governed by a regional body with national governance from New Zealand Playcentre Federation (NZPF). During 2018, playcentre is transitioning from operating as a federation with 32 regional associations to becoming one national body with six regional offices. The Auckland region is now made up of 45 playcentres from the Auckland, Tamaki and Counties Playcentre Associations. A regional manager oversees the governance, management and administration for this region and has a team of staff to support individual playcentres. The restructuring includes policies, technology and adult education. There continues to be a period of transition for all playcentre whānau and staff as they adapt to new systems and responsibilities.</p><p>The federation employs a part-time centre support worker (CSW) and centre administrator (CA) to manage day-to-day operations, curriculum and administration. To enable the playcentre to meet licensing requirements a qualified early childhood teacher attends each session. Other members have or are working towards attaining course two and course three qualifications.</p><p>Members have responded positively to recommendations in the 2015 ERO report. They have engaged in professional learning and development to strengthen self-review processes, improve documentation of children’s learning and increase awareness of bicultural practice. Sustainability is a priority for the centre, with experienced members and their families moving on.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three playcentre reviews in the Counties Playcentre Associations.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The programme provides children with an effective combination of child-initiated and parent-led activities and experiences. Children demonstrate confidence as they make choices and interact with a wide variety of materials and equipment that respond to their interests and provide opportunities for problem solving and challenge. Sustained periods of uninterrupted play are thoughtfully combined with shared routines to provide children and adults with meaningful opportunities for social interactions. Children benefit from a well-resourced and presented environment that is focused on their learning.</p><p>Children experience a learning environment that is well-prepared. Through regular planned excursions, children are able to engage with the wider community. Aspects such as literacy, mathematics, science and the creative arts are well integrated throughout the programme. The extended session offers further extension and opportunities for children to develop working theories. Children benefit from learning through play alongside their parents and other supportive adults.</p><p>Children's emerging interests, identified strengths and areas for development inform planning. There are regular opportunities for parents to share their aspirations and knowledge of their child as a learner. This information is displayed, supporting all members to respond to each child's interests, dispositions and learning. Photographs, examples of art and the child's engagement in the life of the centre are recorded by parents in their child’s portfolio. Assessment continues to be an area for ongoing development.</p><p>Members are at the beginning stages of enacting culturally responsive practices. Resources and equipment with a Māori theme are integrated throughout areas of play. The centre support worker models the use te reo Māori when interacting with children, giving them a greater understanding of their bicultural heritage.</p><p>A flexible and inclusive approach support the effective transition of children and their families into and throughout the centre. A buddy system offers support to new members undertaking playcentre course work and learning about playcentre. Centre members have established positive relationships with, and close involvement in, the local primary school. Children enjoy opportunities to join in school events.</p><p>Children under the age of two years enjoy a calm and responsive learning space. Parents maintain a relaxed and caring pace in which infants have space and time to lead their early learning. Young children benefit from tuakana-teina relationships as they participate with older children in a mixed-age setting.</p><p>Collaborative leadership opportunities allow members to extend and share their knowledge and skills. Roles and responsibilities are divided amongst the members. They recognise there is an urgent need to fill key positions. Members are actively encouraged to undertake training to support building capability and meet licensing requirements. Family commitments and distance of professional development opportunities remain a challenge for members' participation. A strategic and annual plan are improvement focused, including building members capacity and focused on positive outcomes for children. Self review is developing and informs decision making. Children benefit from experienced leaders who role model quality practice that is focused on positive learning outcomes.</p><p>The regional management team take responsibility for specific tasks relating to effective operations of individual playcentres. Newly appointed regional personnel are making progress with existing systems and establishing regional management structures for supporting centres. Centre support workers are guided by regional centre support coordinators. Systems are being developed for monitoring the quality of programmes for children, adult education levels, and health and safety requirements. The teams are aware of the unique strengths and needs of the playcentre and the Regional Manager provides professional leadership to sustain improvement, growth and the focus on fostering positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Through self review, consideration should now be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>reviewing the centre philosophy to ensure it reflects the current playcentre members and community and aligns to the revised <em>Te Whāriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing expectations, offering mentoring and guidance for members to ensure consistency in assessment practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using <em>Te Whāriki</em> to inform planning, including bicultural perspectives.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve and strengthen practice the Auckland Playcentre regional leaders should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>revisit the commitment to Te Tiriti partnership to increase bicultural understanding and integration of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori to support playcentres' practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clarify and upskill playcentre support roles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build regional office capability to embed new parent education programmes and qualifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve understanding and use of internal evaluation as a tool to guide practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop, evaluate and report against a regional long-term and annual action plan aligned to goals for improvements at national and regional level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embed and evaluate how effectively the new playcentre structure and systems support all learners including Pasifika and children with additional needs.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hunua Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hunua Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Adrienne Fowler</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>9 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/#ngapou" class="ss-broken"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
