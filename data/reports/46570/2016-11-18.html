</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Reggio Bambini Private Preschool and Infant Centre is a privately owned and operated all day education and care centre located in Tawa. This is the first education review for the centre which has been operating on a full licence for approximately one year.</p><p>The service is licensed for 39 children, including 16 children aged up to two years of age. The children attending are mostly from the surrounding neighbourhood and come from a number of ethnic backgrounds, including Māori.</p><p>Of the six teaching staff, five are qualified and have full practising certificates.</p><p>A weaving together of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum and Reggio Emilia inspired practices underpin the service philosophy and curriculum.</p><p>The physical environment is organised in a way that allows the service's youngest children the opportunity for uninterrupted play, exploration and rest. Specific teaching teams are assigned to each of these separate spaces.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's holistic development and learning are well planned for and nurtured. The philosophy goal for children is for them to be valued, included and feel safe as they actively engage in a range of spontaneous and planned activities or experiences.</p><p>The curriculum includes an appropriate emphasis on literacy and mathematical skills development. These are incorporated in the daily programme through meaningful contexts. Attentive teachers support children to make new discoveries and develop new knowledge and abilities.</p><p>Te ao Māori and te reo Māori are part of children's daily experience, as is the opportunity for them to hear and use Pacific languages. Leaders identify building teachers' cultural competence and celebrating children's and families languages, cultures and identities through the curriculum as next steps. ERO affirms this direction.</p><p>A calm, positive and inclusive tone prevails in the centre. Interactions between adults and children are nurturing, respectful and reciprocal. Families and whānau work in partnership with centre staff to support their children’s learning.</p><p>Children's transitions into the centre and between age groups are well supported. These practices and close communication with families contribute positively to continuity of care and learning between home and the centre. Centre leaders continue to establish relationships with local school staff to enhance children's transition to school.</p><p>Provision for the service’s youngest children is guided by teachers’ research into best practice. A relationship-based approach results in teachers knowing young children and their whānau very well. Adults are nurturing, highly attuned to these youngsters’ verbal and nonverbal cues and responsive to their needs and requests.</p><p>Leaders and teachers use assessment information well. Individual learning journals celebrate children’s achievements, their dispositions for learning as well as their developing skills, knowledge and attitudes.</p><p>Teachers' analysis of assessment information identifies individual and groups of children's interests and this is the basis for ongoing planning. Teaching strategies provide children with increasingly complex learning experiences over time.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers are focused on continually improving outcomes for children, their families and whānau. Self review for accountability and improvement is well understood. Processes for review and internal evaluation bring staff together collaboratively and include a focus on learners. These guide ongoing decision making effectively.</p><p>Building and supporting professional practice is well considered and aligns to the service’s strategic and annual priorities for development.</p><p>Review and development of the appraisal process continues and supports leaders’ and teachers’ ongoing development. The recent inclusion of a summary document, for demonstrating that teachers have met the requirements of the Education Council should enhance the process further.</p><p>Teachers are developing as highly reflective practitioners who seek out current theory and best practice, and adapt their teaching in light of this new knowledge.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service should continue to use review and internal evaluation processes to generate timely information about progress toward goals, and evaluate the impact of innovations for children and their families.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Reggio Bambini Private Preschool and Infant Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to: </p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Reggio Bambini Private Preschool and Infant Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>18 November 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
