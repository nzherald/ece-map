</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bowen Early Childhood Education Centre Incorporated is located on the grounds of Cardinal McKeefry School in Wilton, Wellington. It is licensed for 30 children, with provision for 10 children under two years of age.</p><p>The centre is an incorporated society. A committee of parent volunteers is responsible for the overall governance of the service. The centre manager and assistant manager undertake the day-to-day running of the service.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review, the centre has strengthened its provision for infants and toddlers. They have a separate space but are able to freely interact with older children in a safe and supportive environment.</p><p>The service has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are nurtured in an environment that is welcoming and strongly reflects the centre’s philosophy. Teachers know the children and their families well. A sense of belonging for children and families is fostered through positive reciprocal relationships.</p><p><em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, children’s interests and parent aspirations guide the curriculum. Literacy, mathematics and science are well integrated throughout the daily programme. Good use is made of community resources to enrich the curriculum and to extend children’s learning.</p><p>Children engage in child initiated play. They have access to a wide range of activities and resources. They are supported to develop physical skills, problem-solve, and grow their social competencies. Teachers and children enjoy learning and have fun.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are nurtured through sensitive caregiving. There has been a deliberate focus on providing young children with a safe space and resources that support their interests and development. Routines are unhurried and flexible. Teachers make the most of these to foster children’s self-help skills and independence.</p><p>Developing their cultural competencies and integrating te ao Māori across the curriculum is a strength for some teachers. The centre manager and assistant manager recognise that this is an area for ongoing development.</p><p>Assessment practices have been reviewed. This has increased teachers’ focus on recognising and responding to children’s learning. Progress towards achieving individual goals is monitored through learning journeys. Leaders should continue to build teachers’ understanding of effective assessment practice to promote children’s culture, language and identity and to increase the complexity of children’s learning.</p><p>Portfolios are attractive and keep parents well informed about their child’s learning and participation. Children enjoy sharing them. The newly introduced e-portfolios are a useful way of sharing children’s learning between the centre and home.</p><p>Transitions into the centre and on to school are planned and responsive to the individual needs of children and their families. Regular visits to the adjacent school provide the opportunity for children to experience school life.</p><p>Positive outcomes for children are promoted by teachers working collaboratively. Ongoing communication ensures the needs of children are responded to throughout the day.</p><p>There is a strong focus on continual improvement and capacity building through appraisal. Teachers reflect on their practice and gather evidence which effectively supports ongoing teacher development.</p><p>There is an established process for self review. It contributes to decision-making about centre operation and teaching and learning. Leaders have identified that they should strengthen the process by evaluating the effectiveness and impact of their practices on outcomes for children.</p><p>The strategic plan provides clear direction for the service. Parent committee members bring a range of knowledge and skill to the governance role. They are reviewing and strengthening systems and processes to support sustainability and succession planning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Parents and teachers are focused on improving outcomes for children. They should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>develop their cultural competencies and understanding of te ao Māori</li>
<li>build teachers' knowledge and understanding of current assessment practice</li>
<li>strengthen self-review practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bowen Early Childhood Education Centre Inc. completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bowen Early Childhood Education Centre Inc. will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>11 November 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
