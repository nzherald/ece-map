</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids at Play Childcare Centre is located in the inner city suburb of Mt Eden, Auckland. The service has served its community since 1987, and operates as a not for profit incorporated society. The management committee, made up from elected parents and the centre manager, is the governing body for the centre.</p><p>The committee appoints a centre manager who has responsibility for professional leadership and for the daily operations of the service. The centre provides education and care for 42 children up to the age of five years, including 12 under the age of two. Children are organised into two specific groups and areas, those under two years and those over two years old.</p><p>The centre has a history of positive ERO reports. The 2012 report recommended the centre focus on extending children’s learning through a review of the environment and the opportunities it offered children. A further suggestion for teaching staff was to engage cognitively with children to lift the level of complexity in their play. Progress has been made in these areas and they continue to be a focus for centre development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Families and children are warmly welcomed into the centre. Children settle quickly, demonstrate a sense of belonging and engage confidently with adults and each other. Teachers respond sensitively to children’s care routines and specific ongoing needs and preferences.</p><p>Staff offer a programme based on emerging topic activities, developed from teachers’ observations of children at play. There are often three or four different emerging topics to engage children simultaneously in the centre’s learning environment. This provides a variety of choice and some degree of challenge. Teachers now need to extend and strengthen children’s individual learning in these contexts in line with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Assessment portfolios show that teachers write informative learning stories centred on children’s learning experiences and on their progress over time. The children’s portfolios are of good quality in this respect. Teachers’ planning would benefit from better use of the portfolio information about children’s interests, strengths and abilities, to feed into the learning programme.</p><p>Older children are regularly grouped together, particularly in the afternoons, to follow a transition to school programme. Centre leaders could consider professional development for staff to explore the most effective and current practice for supporting the learning of this age group.</p><p>Since ERO’s review in 2012 the centre has focused professional development on the understanding of schema. This knowledge has enabled teachers to deepen children's learning experiences. The centre manager and teachers are accessing other current and relevant sources of professional learning to ensure a high quality curriculum and programme are provided for children.</p><p>Some spontaneous self review has been effectively conducted by the centre manager and teachers to improve centre policies and procedures. There now needs to be a focus on developing strategic planning and the use of self review to bring about continuous improvement to learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO endorses the centre leaders’ self-identified next steps to:</p><ul>
<li>think and plan strategically to work meaningfully towards the centre’s vision and philosophy</li>
<li>strengthen learning partnerships with parents that focus on children’s interests, strengths and abilities and feed this information into the planned programme</li>
<li>continue to focus on the development of te reo me ōna tikanga Māori in the centre’s programme to support children’s understanding of New Zealand’s bicultural heritage.</li>
</ul><p>ERO also recommends that centre leaders and teachers:</p><ul>
<li>make links between assessment and planning to better support individual children’s learning and interests and to reflect current best practice in early years education</li>
<li>continue to develop self review that promotes better learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids at Play Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids at Play Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>9 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
