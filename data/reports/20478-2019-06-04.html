</table><p>Collectively Kids Ltd is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Collectively Kids Ltd is a well-established centre in Mount Albert. It is licensed to provide education and care for 30 children, including up to 10 under the age of two years. There are separate indoor and outdoor play spaces for the two age groups. An emphasis on children of all ages learning with and from each other, means that there are regular opportunities for them to mingle.</p><p>The centre has remained in the same ownership since it was established. The owner, team leader and head teacher work collaboratively to lead the centre. All teachers hold current practising certificates. An additional staff member supports teachers in working with children with additional learning needs.</p><p>The centre's vision, philosophy and goals are well articulated. An emphasis on environmental education, social justice and the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand underpins the play-based curriculum.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report noted very positive relationships and high levels of communication between children, parents and staff. Interactions were consistent and focused on children's wellbeing and learning. These positive features of the centre continue to be apparent. The 2015 report identified that teachers' next step was to continue increasing their focus in assessment portfolios on individual children's learning. Very good progress has been made in this regard.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children confidently lead their own learning in a well-resourced and presented environment. They make choices about what they want to do and who they will play with. They demonstrate care for each other and are keen to help. Children learn to take responsibility for themselves and have opportunities to be leaders. They are very well supported to develop social skills and to regulate their own behaviour and emotions. Children under the age of two receive very good quality care.</p><p>Teachers are skilled in the ways they work with children. They know children and their families well and consistently promote children's wellbeing and learning. They often read to children and provide very good support for language development. Teachers are inclusive and responsive to children's individual needs and preferences, and respect all children as competent and capable learners. Their interactions are underpinned by the concept of ako. Teachers and children learn from and with each other. There is evidence of children participating in tuakana/teina relationships. Parents and whānau are seen as an integral part of their children's learning.</p><p>The curriculum is well developed and reflects the centre's vision and philosophy. Priorities for children's learning are well articulated and observable in practice. Children have very good opportunities to contribute to caring for their local environment and to learn about global issues of sustainability. They experience an environment where te reo and tikanga Māori are interwoven in interactions, routines, rituals and documentation. Children learn about diversity, and consideration of others is fostered. Parents who spoke to ERO expressed their appreciation of what the centre offers their children.</p><p>Teachers implement effective planning and assessment processes. Records of children's learning are highly individualised. Parents are invited to contribute to the planning for their children. Parent aspirations are incorporated into children's individual learning goals. Very good provision for non-contact time enables teachers to plan for and record children's learning within the framework of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Curriculum projects and annual cultural events ensure that children benefit from rich and varied learning experiences. Centre leaders are now focusing on how they can strengthen the evaluation of curriculum plans to better evidence positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Centre operations are supported by well-established systems and processes. A comprehensive strategic plan guides centre development. Internal evaluation and teacher appraisal promote critical inquiry and help sustain continuous improvement. The owner encourages distributed leadership, and good use is made of mentors to strengthen professional practice. The current review of centre policies and procedures will help to enhance these sound foundations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have identified appropriate key next steps for centre development, including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen the evaluation of curriculum planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further developing the visual arts within the curriculum.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Collectively Kids Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>4 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
