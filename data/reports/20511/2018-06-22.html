</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>White Heron Learning Centre - Manurewa is one of four early childhood centres owned and operated by White Heron Learning Centres Ltd. The centre is licensed to provide for 50 children, including up to 15 under two years of age. Most children who attend the centre are Māori.</p><p>The centre provides programmes for children in two age groups, in separate buildings. Children under two have their own outdoor play area. They mix with the older children at the beginning of the day for karakia and waiata, and at various other times, particularly at the end of the day.</p><p>The centre's philosophy focuses on providing opportunities for children to become confident in their cultural identity, particularly Māori children. It recognises the development of the whole child as important to establishing a positive attitude and approach to learning.</p><p>The centre manager leads a team that includes eight qualified teachers and two unqualified staff. She is responsible for the day-to-day operation of two centres in the organisation. A White Heron area manager has oversight of all four centres. She and the centre managers support teachers' professional development and improvements in outcomes for children.</p><p>The positive features identified in the 2014 ERO report continue to be evident. In response to ERO's recommendations, very good progress has been made in fostering children's individual interests and promoting more child-led, creative, complex and sustained learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and confident in the centre, where their home languages and cultures are affirmed. They have positive relationships with teachers and engage in play that interests them. Children enthusiastically explore the outdoor environment. They often play in small groups, communicating respectfully with each other and respond well to adult support. Indoor spaces are uncluttered and there is a good variety of resources. Teachers foster children's social competence and promote their independence through many opportunities to make choices and develop self-help skills.</p><p>Teachers know children well. They respond to individual interests and are sensitive and responsive to children with additional learning needs. Adults' conversations with children encourage them to share their ideas and sustain their play for long periods. Teachers integrate te reo Māori and foster the use of children's first languages. They support children to develop early literacy and mathematics concepts in meaningful ways.</p><p>Infants are nurtured very well. Appropriate teaching philosophies and high adult-to-child ratios enable infants to quickly develop a sense of belonging in the centre. Capable teachers respect the competence of these very young children. They enable them to explore independently, undertake physical challenges and develop relationships with others. Infants confidently interact with adults and make choices about their play.</p><p>Teachers play with the children, engaging them in conversation to support their ideas. They prompt children's problem solving, and encourage inclusive games and shared explorations. The older children are highly independent and competent. The outdoor environment provides physical challenge and opportunities for imaginative play.</p><p>Teachers have made good progress in strengthening their programme planning and including child and whānau voice in the process. They engage in professional learning and reflection about the curriculum and current best practices in early childhood education. They are now integrating aspects of their new learning into their planning and assessment processes. The positive impacts of these initiatives are very apparent in child-directed play sessions that clearly promote creative, complex and sustained play. These positive aspects are not so apparent in the teacher-led group sessions that also form part of the daily programme.</p><p>Parents are interested partners in their children's learning. Teachers actively foster family involvement through regular informal discussions and surveys. These enable parents to share their aspirations for their children. Parents who spoke to ERO were enthusiastic about children's learning opportunities at the centre and the relationships they have with teachers. They appreciate how well teachers know their children and support them to be independent learners.</p><p>Leaders have a good understanding of the strengths and next steps for the centre. They encourage and support teachers' ongoing professional development. Internal workshops, mentoring, and external learning opportunities are linked to whole-centre goals. Leaders are keen to increase teachers' leadership capabilities and their knowledge about extending children's learning.</p><p>The centre is well managed. Leaders have developed a sound policy framework, appropriate health and safety practices, and effective systems for the efficient management of the White Heron Learning Centres. The strategic plan provides broad guidelines for future directions. The annual plan helps leaders to ensure that legal requirements are met. Evaluating for effectiveness has become the standard practice. The organisation is well placed to integrate new Education Council requirements into its teacher appraisal processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps that will support centre progress and sustainability include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to plan and implement ways to develop learning partnerships with whānau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that all aspects of the programme reflect the intent and underpinnings of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>including goals related to implementing <em>Te Whāriki</em> as part of the teacher appraisal process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of White Heron Learning Centre - Manurewa completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of White Heron Learning Centre - Manurewa will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>22 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
