<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Kindercare Learning Centres Preschool (12 P) is located in Botany Downs, Auckland, caters for children from two to five years of age. It is part of a two-licence, purposebuilt complex catering for children up to five years of age. The operation of both centres is underpinned by the Kindercare organisation&rsquo;s well developed philosophy, policies and practices.</p><p>The Kindercare philosophy of &lsquo;safe, loved and learning&rsquo; is reflected in the way teachers interact with children. Teachers work closely with children, supporting them in their play and engaging them in meaningful conversation. Teachers respond well to parents&rsquo; aspirations for promoting their children&rsquo;s literacy and numeracy abilities, and children have many opportunities for learning in these areas. Teachers are working with parents to develop their understanding of the value of learning through play.</p><p>The preschool rooms provide opportunities for children to learn about the world around them through topics of interest. Children are enthusiastic about learning and keen to talk about what they have learned. They are confident, articulate, friendly, cooperative, and confident to approach adults. A range of interesting activities and resources is provided to support children&rsquo;s exploration and learning.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s new director was appointed at the beginning of 2012. She provides good professional leadership and manages the centre well. Most staff have a long association with Kindercare and are familiar with its systems and processes.</p><p>Self review is being used effectively to set clear strategic direction for centre development over the next three years. Areas identified for development include strengthening teacher practice in assessment and planning,to better cater for children&rsquo;s emerging interests. ERO&rsquo;s review findings align well with findings arising from the centre&rsquo;s own self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>Before the review, the management of Kindercare Learning Centres - (12 P) was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKindercare Learning Centres - (12 P).</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2009 ERO report for the centre identified the need to improve planning and opportunities for fostering child-initiated learning. There has been some progress in these areas of centre performance.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><em>Interactions.</em> Teachers work with children at their level, taking an interest in and supporting their play. Teachers take time to listen to children and respond to encourage and extend conversations. They use open-ended questions effectively to promote children&rsquo;s thinking and learning.</p><p><em>Developing independence.</em> Teachers provide children with many opportunities to develop independence. These include opportunities for children to make choices about their play, to select from available resources, and to decide whether they will participate in organised activities.</p><p><em>Partnership with parents.</em> Teachers seek and respond to parental aspirations for their children. Parents have a strong desire for children to develop good early literacy and numeracy skills. Children develop knowledge and skills in these areas through their play.</p><p><em>Science.</em> Children have many opportunities to develop early science knowledge and positive attitudes towards science learning. Science displays and activities are prominent in all preschool rooms.</p><p><em>Leadership.</em> The new centre director is well supported by the Kindercare management team and is well informed about the characteristics of effective teaching practice. She has built positive relationships with staff and has begun a planned process to raise teaching practice and build leadership capability across the centre.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>Centre managers and ERO agree that centre practices would be improved by:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening programme planning to better cater for the emerging interests of individuals and groups of children</li>
<li>strengthening performance management systems to support ongoing improvement in teaching practice</li>
<li>providing support to help teachers to increase the use of te reo M&#257;ori throughout the day</li>
<li>strengthening self review and programme evaluation by clarifying the goals set for each room and by providing teachers with feedback on the quality of their programme evaluation</li>
<li>increasing opportunities for uninterrupted outdoor play for all preschool children.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Kindercare Learning Centres - (12 P) completed an ERO<em> Centre Management Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practice the managers should strengthen systems for managing risks when children go on excursions outside the centre.</p><a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendation</h2><p>ERO and the centre managers agree that managers and teachers should continue to strengthen self-review practices to promote ongoing improvement.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

It is part of a two-licence, purposebuilt complex catering for children up to five years of age. The operation of both centres is underpinned by the Kindercare organisation&rsquo;s well developed philosophy, policies and practices.</p><p>The Kindercare philosophy of &lsquo;safe, loved and learning&rsquo; is reflected in the way teachers interact with children. Teachers work closely with children, supporting them in their play and engaging them in meaningful conversation. Teachers respond well to parents&rsquo; aspirations for promoting their children&rsquo;s literacy and numeracy abilities, and children have many opportunities for learning in these areas. Teachers are working with parents to develop their understanding of the value of learning through play.</p><p>The preschool rooms provide opportunities for children to learn about the world around them through topics of interest. Children are enthusiastic about learning and keen to talk about what they have learned. They are confident, articulate, friendly, cooperative, and confident to approach adults. A range of interesting activities and resources is provided to support children&rsquo;s exploration and learning.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s new director was appointed at the beginning of 2012. She provides good professional leadership and manages the centre well. Most staff have a long association with Kindercare and are familiar with its systems and processes.</p><p>Self review is being used effectively to set clear strategic direction for centre development over the next three years. Areas identified for development include strengthening teacher practice in assessment and planning,to better cater for children&rsquo;s emerging interests. ERO&rsquo;s review findings align well with findings arising from the centre&rsquo;s own self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information About Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
