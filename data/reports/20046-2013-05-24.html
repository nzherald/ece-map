<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The centre is well placed to continue developing its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Educare 2012 Ltd in Glenfield, Auckland provides all day education and care services for children between two and five years of age. Management of the privately-owned centre is the responsibility of a recently appointed centre manager.</p><p>The centre is currently in a significant period of progress and change. Team building and re-establishing centre-wide expectations and practices have been goals in the past six months. The centre manager has worked with teachers to lift the quality of teaching practices, the learning programme and environment. Building positive relationships with children and their families has also been a priority.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The centre manager has a clear long-term vision for the centre. She models a positive, collaborative style of leadership and is open and responsive to feedback. The manager provides skilful professional guidance and support for centre staff. These effective practices have swiftly contributed to a culture of improvement and the development of an enthusiastic and committed teaching team.</p><p>Positive changes include:</p><ul>
<li>a programme that is responsive to children&rsquo;s interests</li>
<li>flexible routines that promote children&rsquo;s independence and provide opportunities for sustained play</li>
<li>regular informal communication between teachers and families about children&rsquo;s experiences at the centre</li>
<li>the introduction of individual records of learning for all children.</li>
</ul><p>Children have a sense of belonging and settle quickly into the centre. A calm, relaxed and respectful tone supports their engagement in the programme. Children are confident to ask questions and make decisions about their learning. They play well with and alongside their peers.</p><p>Teachers form warm, caring relationships with children. They work beside children to support their learning. Good questioning techniques challenge children&rsquo;s thinking and encourage them to share their ideas.</p><p>The indoor environment reflects teachers&rsquo; pride and their commitment to improving children&rsquo;s learning experiences. It is attractively and thoughtfully presented with accessible resources. A variety of meaningful activities supports children&rsquo;s learning. Literacy and numeracy opportunities are increasingly included in children&rsquo;s play.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>While substantial progress has been made, ERO, the owner and centre manager agree that significant next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>establishing long-term and annual planning systems as a way to review and monitor progress</li>
<li>developing shared understanding of the benefits and process of self review</li>
<li>improving programme planning, assessment and evaluation practices</li>
<li>implementing effective staff management processes, including annual appraisal for teachers and the centre manager.</li>
</ul><p>Staff will need time to reflect on and modify their teaching and to implement new programme, self review and long-term planning systems. The centre manager should ensure that staff have regular opportunities to review and discuss all aspects of their work.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Educare 2012 Ltd completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>24 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
