</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mairangi Bay Playcentre is a well established centre which operates as a parent-led cooperative within the North Shore Playcentre Association. The centre runs four mixed-age sessions each week, catering for children up to six years of age. It also offers one session a week for children over four years old.</p><p>The centre has a positive history of ERO reviews. A high level of training amongst centre members and positive relationships and practices continue to be evident. Members have responded well to the recommendations in ERO’s 2010 report. A culture of robust reflection has contributed to enjoyable and meaningful learning experiences for children.</p><p>The North Shore Playcentre Association is the umbrella organisation for twenty one playcentres situated in North Auckland. Many of these centres are semi-rural. The association manages and distributes centre funding and provides a training programme for parents/whānau to achieve playcentre qualifications. It also has good systems to support centre members in managing the centres and providing educational programmes for children. The association is currently reviewing many aspects of its operations to help reduce the administrative workload for its members.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of twelve playcentre reviews in the North Shore Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Adults provide a welcoming and calm atmosphere that helps children to interact positively with each other. They are attentive to children, engage in rich conversations and encourage children to be creative. Adults constructively consult children during planned self reviews and value their feedback. High levels of trust are evident between adults and children.</p><p>Children know each other and adults well. They are supported to interact in caring and respectful ways that enable infants, toddlers and children to learn with and from each other. Children benefit from a programme which naturally integrates literacy, numeracy and science in meaningful contexts. They enjoy opportunities for sustained play in a well resourced environment. Children enjoy the extensive outdoor area that is complete with fruit trees, gardens and native bush. This provides challenge and exploration opportunities for children.</p><p>The centre has established good relationships with local iwi and marae. Bicultural practices are respectfully included in the programme and learning environment. A significant feature of the playcentre is its well established Matariki celebrations, which include past families and local community involvement. The promotion of bicultural partnerships with Māori whānau is also evident in the wider association operations. The management team show a strong commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and to building both adults’ and children’s familiarity with te reo and tikanga Māori.</p><p>Children’s cultural backgrounds are recognised and valued. Adults work collaboratively to respond meaningfully to Pacific children’s cultures. Pacific families support the centre by sharing their skills and knowledge with children and adults.</p><p>Good quality, innovative processes for programme planning and assessment are evident. Adults evaluate sessions on a daily basis, and carry out more in-depth evaluations of sessions once a term. They are highly reflective and collaborative, sharing responsibilities for centre operations and learning programmes. The centre’s annual plan is referred to regularly and guides ongoing discussion and review. A new vision statement outlines the expectations the centre has to be ‘an outstanding playcentre’.</p><p>Centre members have developed positive relationships with nearby schools. They are invited to a number of school events and regular school visits are undertaken by parents and children. They evaluate the four year old session annually, and recognise the importance of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, in guiding this programme. Adults empower children to be confident, capable learners who are well prepared for school.</p><p>The association management team takes responsibility for specific tasks relating to the function of the association. They are committed to, and enthusiastic about, their involvement in playcentre and actively foster emergent leadership to help sustain the association. The management team demonstrates the professional leadership necessary to help the association respond to change, make decisions and manage issues as they arise. The North Shore Playcentre Association provides effective support to help this playcentre remain very well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre members have identified the following areas as key next steps for the playcentre:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to enhance the indoor and outdoor learning environments to promote deeper exploration and challenges for children</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen individualised learning plans for children within and alongside the emergent curriculum</li>
<li>continuing to develop strategies to include children’s perspective during planned self reviews.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mairangi Bay Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mairangi Bay Playcentre will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>15 November 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
