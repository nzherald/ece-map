</table><p>Kindercare Learning Centres (21) Sylvia Park is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres - Sylvia Park, is owned and administered by Kindercare Learning Centres Limited. All centres operate under the Kindercare vision, values, philosophy and strategic goals. Together these form the philosophy on which each centre and the organisation base their practices. Each Kindercare centre provides children with nutritious meals and snacks.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 70 children with a maximum of 25 aged up to two years. The large teaching team provides for infants, toddlers and young children in four different areas. Infants and toddlers play in two separate indoor and outdoor play areas. The older children share a spacious, outdoor play space. Most of the older children play and learn in a large indoor room with a small number of the oldest children using a different room for specific aspects of their learning.</p><p>Families are from diverse cultural backgrounds. Many children are learning English as an additional language. Parents have the opportunity to participate in a Kindercare parent education programme.</p><p>Since the 2015 ERO review, there has been a significant number of staff changes. The long-serving centre director has responsibility for the day-to-day operation. She works closely with newly appointed room leaders. Most staff are qualified early childhood teachers. Leaders and teachers are continuing to address the key next steps identified in the 2015 ERO report. These included bicultural practices, annual planning and programmes that reflect best practice in early childhood education.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight Kindercare Learning Centre reviews in the Auckland area.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and friendly. They experience respectful, caring interactions with teachers and each other. Children:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>play cooperatively in small groups or are able to work alone in the spacious indoor and outdoor areas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>follow their interests in the well-presented, prepared environments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have many opportunities to extend their ideas and oral language skills.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Infants and toddlers play and learn in a calm, nurturing environment. Teachers respond to children's verbal and non-verbal cues. They use information from home to support each child's routines, and foster their sense of belonging and wellbeing at the centre.</p><p>Teachers are welcoming of children and families. They respectfully acknowledge each family's culture. Some teachers are able to speak with families in their own language. Teachers of older children use a range of approaches to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>integrate literacy and mathematics concepts into meaningful learning experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure children have consistent access to a range of creative art materials</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>talk with children about their interests and extend thinking through questioning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>keep parents well informed about their children's participation in the centre's learning programmes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Transitions into and within the centre are flexible, thoughtfully managed, and well-paced to meet the needs of the family. Older children have many opportunities to build self-help and independence skills to support their successful transition to school.</p><p>The Kindercare organisation provides a broad range of support for centres and families. Comprehensive management and accountability systems across the company include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>support for centre directors through regular visits by area managers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effective processes for ensuring that children have safe and healthy learning environments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal, mentoring and well targeted professional development that supports teachers to build their capability.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to build teachers' knowledge and understanding of the Treaty of Waitangi and the integration of aspects of tikanga Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the extent to which children can independently access and revisit records of their own learning at the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further developing assessment, planning and evaluation processes to show children's next learning steps more clearly and also to indicate how teachers' planned strategies for adding complexity to children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing shared understandings about internal evaluation and ensuring it is guided by evaluative questions and reasoning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next Steps for the Organisation</h3><p>Key next steps for the Kindercare organisation include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>make progress with ensuring the company's vision, values, philosophy, systems and practices reflect and enact the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi</li>
<li>evaluate how consistently leaders, including area managers and centre directors, build teachers’ capability and improve practice</li>
<li>embed practices that support leaders' ongoing commitment to strengthening, and reporting about the outcomes of, strategic planning and internal evaluation across the organisation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres (21) Sylvia Park completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>28 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
