</table><p>Lincoln Village Preschool and Nursery is well placed to promoted positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lincoln Village Preschool and Nursery is located in the semi-rural town of Lincoln in Canterbury. The centre places an emphasis on developing strong links to the community and supporting local families and diverse cultures within the Lincoln University Village.</p><p>The centre has three classrooms to cater for the specific learning needs of infants, toddlers and young children. Most staff are qualified early childhood teachers or in training to become qualified.</p><p>The management and staff, with the support of the Ministry of Education and external professional development, have made good progress, and in some instances exceeded expectations, with all of the areas identified in the March 2014 ERO report. These areas included the development of the centre philosophy, strategic planning, self-review processes, staff appraisal, bicultural understandings and a programme based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the Early Childhood Curriculum.</p><p>The centre manager and some teachers are part of a local community cluster of primary schools and early childhood centres. These relationships promote professional networks and shared professional development to support the learning of children in their community from early childhood to school.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The management team and staff demonstrate a strong commitment to enacting their philosophy. Respectful and inclusive relationships are fostered between management, staff, children and parents. Staff warmly welcome children and families and help them to develop a good sense of belonging. Transitions into the centre and between rooms are personalised and well supported. Parent contributions to the programme are encouraged and valued.</p><p>Children play well with and alongside others, sharing ideas and developing friendships. They are actively involved in a wide range of interesting learning experiences. Conversations between teachers and children are encouraging and supportive.</p><p>Staff have an increased focus on intentional teaching strategies that add value to children’s learning. They provide a curriculum that gives emphasis to literacy learning, oral language development and creative play. Children have opportunities to develop understandings of sustainable practices and to care for the environment. Excursions into the community and visitors to the centre enhance the learning programme.</p><p>The needs of infants and toddlers are well supported. Consistent caregivers foster respectful and caring relationships with children. They sensitively respond to each child’s changing needs and preferences. The importance of play to promote learning is respected and valued. Children are encouraged to independently explore the calm and settled environment, where their wellbeing is actively nurtured.</p><p>Parents are well informed of their children’s interests and learning through informative profile books, wall displays and frequent discussions with teachers. Teachers have focused on strengthening the way they write children’s learning stories. These stories capture the essence of the child as a learner at the centre. Children transitioning to school receive a useful overview of their learning. This includes a summary of learning against the strands of <em>Te Whāriki</em>.</p><p>The centre is well led and managed. Centre managers have a good focus on building sustainability through developing staff leadership skills and confidence. They empower staff to take on lead roles, and support others with centre developments. Staff work well together and are developing a reflective professional culture.</p><p>An increasing commitment to bicultural practice is apparent at management and staff level. Staff with skills and knowledge in te reo and tikanga Māori provide good modelling and support for others. Māori perspectives are becoming more prominent in some key documentation, and practices.</p><p>Centre managers and staff are focused on ongoing improvement and have been very responsive to external professional support. They have made very good use of extensive, targeted, professional development that has resulted in a greater strategic approach and improved management systems to guide the operation of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps are to continue to develop new initiatives and practices across the teaching team. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening understandings and use of in-depth planned self-review and appraisal processes</li>
<li>increasing the focus on the child as a learner in the context of their culture and language</li>
<li>refining and embedding group planning and evaluation</li>
<li>building on parent and child involvement in the child’s learning and goal setting</li>
<li>strengthening bicultural perspectives in practices, documentation and the environment.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lincoln Village Preschool &amp; Nursery completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have been taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lincoln Village Preschool &amp; Nursery will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>28 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
