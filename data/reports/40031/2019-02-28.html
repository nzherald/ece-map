</table><p>Mananui Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mananui Playcentre is a parent-led education and care service located in Whakatane in the Eastern Bay of Plenty. It caters for children from birth to school age and operates two mixed-age morning sessions per week. Two Supporting Parents Alongside Children's Education (SPACE) sessions are also available for parents with infants. The playcentre is licensed for 25 children including up to 15 children under the age of two years. The current roll of 41 children includes six who identify as Māori.</p><p>Through their national philosophy, the playcentre places emphasis on whānau tupu ngātahi – families growing together. They empower adults and children to play, work and grow together and value and affirm parents as first and best educators of their children.</p><p>During 2018, the New Zealand Playcentre Federation transitioned from operating with 32 regional associations to become one national body with six regional offices. In the central North Island six associations have merged into a regional hub renamed Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island Region that now includes 95 playcentres over a large geographic area. During this transition there is some overlap between associations and the new national regional systems and processes. At Mananui Playcentre a role model, centre administrator and support worker are provided by the federation.</p><p>Mananui Playcentre has a positive reporting history with ERO. Since the last ERO review in 2015, the centre has recently responded by strengthening internal evaluation. Assessment and planning of children’s learning remains an area to strengthen.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews in Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive and respectful relationships between children, parents and other trusting adults supports learning through play. Adults are responsive to children's interests. Oral language and social competence development are promoted by rich conversations and open-ended questioning. Māori learners are supported by the use of waiata and te reo Māori is visible in the environment. Members should continue to strengthen the bicultural curriculum. A well-prepared environment invites children to engage in play. Literacy and mathematics are naturally integrated into the daily programme. Children develop a sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>A rich curriculum promotes positive learning outcomes for children. Well-resourced learning spaces are accessible and inclusive of all, including younger children up to the age of two years. Physical challenge, risk taking and active play are encouraged. Children engage with nature in a thoughtfully designed bush area with native plantings and educational information boards. Children lead their own learning, make choices and develop independence and confidence.</p><p>Leaders have identified through internal evaluation that assessment and planning for children’s learning needs strengthening. Members are at early stages of recognising what learning is happening and are using the principles and strands of the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki</em>. Further support is needed to document progression and complexity of learning, and reflect individual children’s language, culture and identity.</p><p>Leaders are promoting a positive culture for learning. Regular meetings are well documented and focused on improvements and sharing of knowledge with all members. The experienced president and committee members encourage parents to participate in adult education courses in early childhood development. A knowledgeable and long-standing role model has developed some useful tools to support members and also facilitates the SPACE programme. Connections with the local community are strengthening with the recent inclusion of a Japanese group. Members are at early stages of developing the strategic plan. This now needs to be completed and an annual plan developed. An induction process for new members is also needed to build their capability.</p><p>The Playcentre Aotearoa overarching strategic plan, philosophy, vision and individual annual plans have been implemented. There is a focus on building capacity through recently reviewed and improved parent education programmes. Regular communication and support between the Playcentre Aotearoa and regions through the restructure support business as usual. Existing policies and systems support centre operations until all new systems developed by Playcentre Aotearoa are implemented nationally. The federation is committed to offering more accessible localised training to respond to the needs of the community.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for Mananui Playcentre are for leaders to support members to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment and planning of children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to build knowledge of <em>Te Whāriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>complete the localised playcentre strategic and annual plans aligned to the strategic vision of Playcentre Aotearoa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop an induction process for new members.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mananui Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Mananui Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>28 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.<span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
