</table><p><span>Wondernauts <span>is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</span></span></p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wondernauts was previously known as Melody Childcare Centre. It is a community based, not-for-profit early childhood centre governed by a trust board and located in the grounds of the Ruakura Research Centre campus. The centre provides full-day education and care and is licensed for 60 children, including 18 up to two years of age. At the time of this ERO review, there were 67 children on the roll, of whom 12 are Māori. Children learn and play in three purpose built, age-related areas, each staffed by a head teacher and a team of teachers. Children participate in an outdoor education programme that includes ongoing and regular excursions to bush areas. A centre van supports these, and other experiences within the local community.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in 2016, the centre manager continues to provide leadership for teachers and the Wondernauts community. There have also been some changes to the teaching team and a new board chairperson. All teachers have a recognised early learning qualification. Developments to property and grounds include enhancements to the bike track area and the large grassed areas for play and exploration in each age-group space.</p><p>During 2018 the centre philosophy was reviewed. The centre vision is 'to lead and affirm our children, whānau and team, fostering a radiant community with a strong focus on exploring, respecting, creating, life-long learning and the natural world'. This vision is woven through the four principles of Te Whakamanawa, Kotahitanga, Whānau Tangata and Nga Hononga. The principles are supported by the pillars of Tamariki First, Quality Team, Community Orientation, Environmental Sustainability and Good Governance.</p><p>The centre has made very good progress in addressing the areas for development from the previous ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Management and staff engage in an effective partnership in learning and care with children, parents and whānau. Families are warmly welcomed and enjoy opportunities to participate and be involved in children's learning. Parent aspirations are gathered and used by teachers to plan individual programmes that respond to each child's strengths, interests and learning dispositions. Parent partnerships are strengthened through on-line individual portfolios which enable them to be involved in ongoing two-way communications about their child's learning. There are also many other formal and informal opportunities for parents to be involved in centre decisions, including in the recent review of the centre philosophy.</p><p>Teachers and leaders have developed respectful, reciprocal relationships with children that promote each child's learning and wellbeing. Teachers continually affirm children for who they are and what they bring to their learning. They notice opportunities to engage in intentional conversations that support children's ideas and scaffold learning. Teaching interactions are calm and unhurried across the centre. This is particularly evident in the infant area where teachers intentionally support these very young children to explore, communicate and develop a sense of belonging within the centre. Positive outcomes for children with additional needs are effectively promoted through close partnerships with families and individual education plans where appropriate.</p><p>Centre leadership is effective in sustaining current strengths and enabling ongoing improvements to the quality of education and care. Sound systems are in place to support clear communication and high levels of professionalism among the teaching team. Leaders maintain high expectations for teacher development, ensuring relevant professional learning is available to support building teacher capability. A robust appraisal process is well aligned with a focus on improving teacher practice and enhancing outcomes for children. Centre leadership contributes to high levels of trust and respect among teachers and ongoing sustainability of centre development.</p><p>Learning environments are thoughtfully planned and generously resourced. Areas are specifically planned to invite children's involvement and challenge their developing physical skills. This enables children to take risks within closely monitored boundaries. Children engage in literacy and mathematical learning which is woven across the curriculum. Learning is well supported by regular trips to nearby bush areas, sustainable practices and a focus on natural environments. The 'Intergenerational Programme' connects young children to the older generation through ongoing meaningful interactions. Resources are also provided to ensure children can access outdoor areas in all weathers. Centre organisation and resources enable children to learn in authentic contexts and real-life scenarios both within and beyond the centre environment. The centre programme affirms and values Aotearoa's bicultural partnership. The language, culture and identity of Māori children and whānau are supported naturally across the centre during conversations with children and throughout centre routines.</p><p>The board provides effective governance oversight for the centre. Trustees receive regular reports from centre leadership. These reports enable them to be well informed and involved with decisions about centre direction and development. Strategic and annual planning provides clarity of direction for the centre and a documented foundation for ongoing internal evaluation. The recently reviewed approach to internal evaluation provides a sound basis for spontaneous, planned and strategic review to support improvements in outcomes for children across all aspects of the service.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO can affirm centre direction in building on current initiatives, including further development of teaching as inquiry across the teaching team.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wondernauts completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>18 December 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
