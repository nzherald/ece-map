</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Akoteu Tuingapapai o Uesile (Fanau Valevale) in Mangere is a well established early childhood centre under the umbrella of the Free Wesleyan Church of Tonga (New Zealand). The centre operates two licences on the one site. Since the 2011 ERO review, extensions to the building have resulted in there being two licensed spaces. This part of the centre is licensed to provide care and education for 15 children, including up to 10 under the age of two years. In 2014 a review of governance and management structures was completed. A Trust Board which includes parent representatives governs the two centres.</p><p>Since the time of the 2011 ERO review, a new centre manager has been appointed to oversee the operational aspects of the centre. The over two’s supervisor oversees the day to day operations of the two licences and works collaboratively with the infants and toddlers supervisor and centre manager. The centre is undergoing some further changes and is being renamed as Matavai Sila’i.</p><p>The majority of the teachers are registered and some are working towards full registration. All the leaders in the centre are new to their roles but not to the centre.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy is to nurture the seed of “loving to learn” in children and to grow their competence. The visual image for this philosophy is of a garland, threaded in the seven papai. The centre philosophy is evident in the curriculum. Children’s language and their physical, social, emotional, spiritual, intellectual, and cultural development are being promoted.</p><p>The programme is Christian based and guided by <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A peaceful and welcoming tone supports infants and toddlers to settle quickly into the programme. They move freely and confidently between the indoor and outdoor environments. Children have formed trusting relationships with their teachers. They are happy to play alongside their peers and participate in sustained play.</p><p>Teachers’ interactions with children are caring and respectful. They work alongside children. There is a sense of calm and the well paced day gives children time to engage in learning. Teachers know individual children well and are responsive to their needs. They have formed strong partnerships with whānau and the onsite church community. A deep respect for and knowledge of Te Tiriti o Waitangi is clearly evident throughout the centre.</p><p>The centre’s Christian philosophy and values along with the Tongan culture are interwoven throughout the programme. Programme planning systems have been reviewed and make clear links with <em>Te Whāriki</em>. Teachers plan collaboratively and develop programmes that emerge from children’s interests. Planning is now displayed on the centre wall and this gives teachers and parents the opportunity to view and contribute to planning regularly.</p><p>Children’s participation in the programme is documented and their learning is identified in their individual portfolios. Teachers should consider making children’s portfolios and displays of their work more accessible for children so that they can readily revisit their own learning. ERO recommends that teachers review the use of templates in the programme and consider how they could provide better opportunities for children to express themselves more creatively. In addition, it is timely for teachers to review how they are guided in their practice and seek further professional development in order to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre manager is establishing effective management practices. He is strengthening systems and processes to encourage transparency and collaboration among staff. A newly appointed supervisor and regular team meetings are contributing to the growth and sharing of leadership within the service. Centre staff are focused on continuous improvement. Leaders agree that providing focussed external professional development should strengthen teaching and learning in the centre and help build leadership capacity.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The Board of Trustees, centre leaders and ERO agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop a strategic and annual plan to guide ongoing development</li>
<li>review documented policy and procedures to ensure they are current and up to date</li>
<li>review performance management systems to ensure they meet Practicing Teachers’ Certificate requirements</li>
<li>develop more systematic self-review processes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Akoteu Tuingapapai O Uesile (Fanau Valevale) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO recommends that the Board of Trustees seek an ECE external advisor to work with management to review centre policies and procedures to ensure that they are current and provide better guidance for staff. For example, it is necessary for the centre to develop a protected disclosure policy and have a privacy officer.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Akoteu Tuingapapai O Uesile (Fanau Valevale) will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>12 August 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
