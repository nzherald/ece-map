</table><p>The service needs support to further develop the quality of the programme, its leadership, and how well its management systems promote high quality provision for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Junior Junction Northcross belongs to a group of six privately owned education and care centres that operate under the Junior Junction organisation in Auckland. This organisation also has centres in other parts of New Zealand. Junior Junction Northcross provides full day education and care for 48 children, including up to 14 infants and toddlers under two years of age.</p><p>The centre originally opened in April 2003 under the name of Kid’s Corner-Northcross Learning Centre. Since then there have been changes in the ownership and staffing of the centre. In June 2012 the centre was closed for reconstruction and refurbishment. It was re-opened in December 2012 as Junior Junction Northcross. New staff were employed. Staff turnover has continued to be high and nearly all of the staff are new. The current owner took over sole ownership of the centre in May, 2015.</p><p>The owner is involved in the business management of the centre. A centre manager and assistant centre manager, who are both new to their roles, oversee the day-to-day running of the centre. Two head teachers, also new to their roles, have overall responsibility for the programmes in separate rooms that cater for children under three years of age and those between three and five years old.</p><p>After many years of disruptions, Junior Junction Northcross is now entering into a more settled period of development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children transition into the centre well. They are settled and engaged in the activities available. They are provided with an attractive learning environment that has a clear child focus. Children benefit from the trusting relationships they have with their positive and affirming teachers. They demonstrate growing social and emotional competencies. Babies and infants are nurtured by teachers. Close emotional bonds with teachers are evident.</p><p>Children and teachers come from diverse cultural backgrounds. These cultures are well represented in the centre. Children are greeted in many languages and cultural and displays capture the multicultural nature of the centre. Teachers and several children are bilingual. Teachers use their language skills to converse with children in both English and their home languages to stimulate children’s thinking and learning.</p><p>The centre has a new governance structure. The new sole owner is keen to strengthen and improve the quality of centre management and leadership systems. To help support the new leaders and managers at Junior Junction Northcross, an organisational review of policies and procedures in light of changes in legislation and external requirements is now timely.</p><p>A strong focus on personnel management and appraisal policies and support systems is also required to help induct, support and develop newly qualified staff in line with the <em>Practising Teacher Criteria</em>. The centre owner is committed to allocating further professional learning and development resources to support this process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the service owner and leaders agree that, to promote further positive outcomes for children, the service leaders and teachers would benefit from external professional development from the Ministry of Education. This support should help the centre to:</p><ul>
<li>evaluate more robustly the quality of the outcomes and provision for children</li>
<li>enhance leadership capability and develop more suitable performance management processes</li>
<li>extend children's learning by strengthening planning, assessment and evaluation cycles</li>
<li>improve the consistency in the quality of teaching and learning practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Junior Junction Northcross completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>During the review some health and safety strategies to improve current practice were discussed with the managers. These included securing items on high storage shelves, and ensuring that the sleep room is well ventilated and meets temperature requirements.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Junior Junction Northcross will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>6 November 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
