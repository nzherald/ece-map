</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Picton Kindergarten is licensed for 22 children aged over two years. It provides all-day education and care four days a week, with a half day on Fridays. All permanently-appointed teachers are qualified and certificated early childhood teachers. The kindergarten is located in the Picton School grounds.</p><p>The kindergarten is administered and supported by the Marlborough Kindergarten Association (MKA). The association is a not-for-profit community-based provider. A general manager is responsible for the operation of the kindergartens. A senior teacher provides ongoing advice and guidance to the kindergartens. A kaiarahi Māori supports culturally responsive practice. Strategic direction and governance decisions are the responsibility of an elected board of trustees.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy gives emphasis to children learning in an environment that focuses on te ao Māori, positive relationships, wellbeing and the local environment.</p><p>Since ERO's 2014 report, Picton Kindergarten has had staff changes. The kindergarten has improved assessment, planning and evaluation practices. The quality of annual planning is now highly effective.</p><p>The association is involved in the Piritahi and Te Wheke Akoranga Kāhui Ako |Communities of Learning. Picton Kindergarten is a member of the Te Wheke Akoranga Kāhui Ako|Community of Learning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Marlborough Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a wide range of choice and a rich learning environment with many opportunities to lead their own learning. They learn in a calm, well-considered learning environment. Children are well supported by teachers and the kindergarten’s routines to develop their confidence and leadership. Routines are consistently implemented, giving children a sense of security. Teachers support children well, to problem-solve and relate to others.</p><p>Teachers actively respond to and care for children with diverse needs. They nurture a sense of belonging through positive, sensitive and responsive relationships with children. Teachers effectively meet children's needs through intentional teaching strategies. They are very deliberate about the way they interact with children to extend their learning and support their social development.</p><p>Teachers effectively promote literacy, mathematics and oral language development. Teachers' planning identifies children's learning needs and goals and the strategies teachers use to monitor children's progress. Teachers foster a respectful and inclusive culture. Individualised learning processes and practices value each individual child. Group-based learning encourages children to explore, and provides them with extended opportunities for sustained play and learning.</p><p>Strong, responsive and respectful relationships are formed with whānau to support children’s sense of belonging. Teachers know families well and integrate whānau knowledge and wishes for their children into the learning programme.</p><p>Children are well supported in transitions into and from the kindergarten. Transitions to school are carefully managed through a thoughtful and nurturing process. Tuakana-teina (where older children look after younger children) is evident in transitions to school.</p><p>Teachers have a strong commitment to teaching and learning that provides meaningful learning contexts for children. Children benefit from a localised bi-cultural curriculum. The kindergarten has strong connections within the local community. Teachers foster these relationships to increase learning opportunities for children to be engaged with and connected to their wider community.</p><p>Te reo Māori is used in meaningful contexts as part of everyday language and woven into the learning programme. Whanaungatanga (working together with a sense of belonging) and kaitiakitanga (guardianship of the environment) are evident in the interactions that occur at the kindergarten. Planning and assessment records show children’s identity as successful learners. These practices support Māori children to identify as Māori and know what Māori success looks like.</p><p>Teachers are well supported by professional learning opportunities. Leadership ensures the service’s vision and goals are focused on learning. Staff effectively use internal evaluation processes to improve outcomes for children. Teachers are focused on extending internal evaluation practices to give more emphasis to deeply inquiring into teaching practices.</p><p>Since ERO’s 2014 reviews of kindergartens in the association, a new general manager, senior teacher and office administrator have been appointed. The board is working towards a new strategic plan. Managers and leaders have proactively addressed ERO’s recommendation for the association identified in previous reports, by strengthening the appraisal policy and processes. However this is in the early stages of implementation.</p><p>The MKA is strongly committed to ensuring all children have equitable access to inclusive education. This is highly evident in the association's philosophy that promotes facilitating learning opportunities through positive relationships, celebrating diversity and ensuring equitable access to education. The philosophy is reflected in decisions made by the board and leadership.</p><p>Kindergartens receive a high level of support from the Marlborough Kindergarten Association. With a number of new head teachers, attention has been placed on growing leadership and building a cohesive culture across the kindergartens. MKA’s involvement in the Kāhui Ako|Communities of learning is making a significant difference to developing teaching as inquiry, transition to school and culturally responsive practices. Teachers are well supported by the kaiarahi Māori to build culturally responsive practices.</p><p>The board and leadership work well together with clear roles and responsibilities. Leadership provides quality reports to the board so they are well informed. Trustees and leaders make good use of internal evaluation to consult with the parent community and staff, to reflect on their own practice and support decision-making.</p><p>The board and association have identified that strategic planning is a key next step. ERO and the association acknowledge that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>plans need to be more focused on strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>significant board decisions need to be underpinned by action plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the association's values need to be more clearly articulated.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and ERO also agree that there is a need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop guidelines that outline association expectations for teaching and learning to better support consistency of practice and sustainability across the kindergartens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fully implement planned observations into appraisal practices in all kindergartens.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Kindergarten leaders and teachers have clearly identified, and ERO agrees, that the next step is to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further consolidate and embed the evaluation of individual and group planning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Picton Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Picton Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>4 September 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
