</tr></tbody></table><p>Collingwood Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p>
<p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Collingwood Playcentre operates under the guidance of the Nelson Playcentre Association. The playcentre is a parent cooperative. Parents are encouraged to be involved in all aspects of the programme and centre operation. A feature of Nelson Playcentres is the provision of a whānau room. These rooms are well used by parents to, socialise, care for very young children rest and participate in training.</p>
<p>Collingwood is a small, isolated rural community. The playcentre is the only early childhood centre in the area. The centre is well supported by parents and the local community. Many families have to travel long distances to attend playcentre sessions. Parents and centre staff also have to travel considerable distances to attend professional development and parent-training courses.</p>
<p>The centre operates three morning sessions. The supervisory team is rebuilding with a number of long-serving, experienced parents leaving the centre as their children transition to school. Currently, there is one supervisor in charge for all three sessions. Parents are encouraged to complete the playcentre parent-training courses. Some are currently in training.</p>
<p>Since the 2012 ERO review, the centre staff and parents have improved child assessment and planning practices.</p>
<p>The review was part of a cluster of 14 playcentre reviews in the Nelson Playcentre Association.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>The centre is welcoming of parents and extended whānau. Many of the parents have a long history of involvement with the centre. Parents are supportive of the centre and are involved in fundraising to assist the operations of the centre.</p>
<p>Children are happy and play well independently or in groups. Parents and supervisors are actively involved in supporting children in their learning. Supervisors know children and their families well. There are good links with home. Children bring their interests to the programme.</p>
<p>Indoor and outdoor environments are spacious and presented to a high standard. There is a focus on science in the programme. The centre has a good range of attractively presented activities and resources which are easily accessed by children.</p>
<p>Child assessment and programme planning provide clear direction for extending children’s learning and building on their interests. Learning stories show the learning occurring for each child and in many cases possible next learning steps. Parents are encouraged to write learning stories for their children.</p>
<p>There is a strong focus on children effectively transitioning to school. The playcentre is located in the grounds of the area school. The centre has an excellent relationship with the new-entrant class with mutual visits a feature of the programme.</p>
<p>Whilst children play well in mixed age groupings, the supervisor and parents are aware of the need to have a dedicated space with appropriate resources for children under two years of age. They have applied for funding to purchase more suitable resources for babies.</p>
<p>The supervisor and parents are committed to including te reo and tikanga Māori, and a bicultural dimension in the programme. They acknowledge that ongoing professional development is necessary to increase their confidence in this area.</p>
<p>The most recent self review by the supervisor and parents focussed on parent ideas and outcomes for children. The understanding and knowledge of self-review processes has been lost through turnover of members of the supervision team. The parent cooperative is committed to developing an understanding of, and implementing self-review practices that contribute to positive outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>The centre and the association identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps for improving children’s learning include:</p>
<ul><li>strengthening processes for sustaining a focus on bicultural Aotearoa/New Zealand and the use of te reo Māori</li>
<li>improving the supervisor’s and parents’ understanding of self review as a tool for improvement</li>
<li>the centre receiving ongoing support from the association to assist in building capacity and sustainability amongst the parent cooperative.</li>
</ul><h3>Nelson Playcentre Association</h3>
<p>The playcentres, with support from the association are increasing their interest in te reo and tikanga Māori, and getting to know Māori parents and their aspirations better. The re-establishment of Te Rōpū, a special group for Māori parents, is beginning to grow Māori parents’ confidence and pride in being Māori.</p>
<p>Playcentre environments are inviting, attractively presented, well resourced and spacious. Good use is made of self review to ensure the wide range of equipment and resources are regularly updated and build children’s creativity, confidence and resourcefulness. Centres often have a strong focus on literacy, mathematics and science.</p>
<p>Families are valued and provided with considerable support in their parenting role. Parent-education courses are held during playcentre sessions and the majority of parents attend. A high percentage of parents are progressing quickly through the education courses.</p>
<p>Children and parents are well supported by experienced and long-serving supervision team members, who have also been or still are playcentre parents. Supervision team members provide considerable support to parents to understand and put into practice:</p>
<ul><li>the playcentre philosophy</li>
<li>cooperative ways of working and sharing responsibilities</li>
<li>the best ways to promote the learning and development of infants, toddlers and children.</li>
</ul><p>Individual centres are well supported by the association executive and the liaison officers who have a good knowledge of children’s wellbeing and learning, and playcentre operation. They are committed to making playcentres work well for families.</p>
<p>The association and centres have a good range of policies and procedures to guide the day-to-day operation of individual playcentres. The liaison officers use their extensive knowledge of playcentre to ensure the centres provide high standards of health and safety, are well maintained and activities are well presented and interesting for children.</p>
<p>There continues to be significant change occurring in the structure of governance and management at association and federation levels.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps for the association</h3>
<p>The association executive and ERO agree that the key next steps for the association to continue to provide positive outcomes for all children include:</p>
<ul><li>sustaining and strengthening of Māori perspectives in the curriculum and supporting Māori children to experience success as Māori</li>
<li>developing ways to ensure that children of Pacific heritage and other cultures maintain connections to their cultural identity and language</li>
<li>establishing an ongoing, well understood self-review process that monitors progress in achieving the strategic goals and improving learning and teaching</li>
<li>reviewing and strengthening the appraisal process for liaison officers and supervisors to ensure all children experience high-quality learning</li>
<li>establishing strategic direction for the organisation that clearly shows the association's priorities for its long-term development and sustainability.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Collingwood Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Collingwood Playcentre will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p>
<h4>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h4>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p>
<h4>Review Coverage</h4>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
