</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>BestStart Paraparaumu is situated at Paraparaumu Beach. It provides education and care for children from three months to school age, five days a week. The centre is licensed for 75 children, including 19 up to the age of two. It offers a choice of full and part time sessions. At the time of this ERO evaluation, 17 of the children enrolled identify as Māori.</p><p>Since the September 2015 ERO evaluation a new centre manager has been appointed. Significant changes to the teaching team have occurred. Most teachers are fully qualified. Day-to-day operation is the responsibility of the centre manager, who supports the teaching team.</p><p>The outside learning environment has been upgraded to connect the three learning rooms. This enables easier access for younger and older children to interact, play and learn together.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified areas requiring further improvement:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing the oral language programme for children' s learning</li>
<li>developing an approach to a bicultural programme</li>
<li>reviewing the appraisal policy, and document guidelines.</li>
</ul><p>Good progress has been made in addressing these identified areas for improvement.</p><p>BestStart Paraparaumu is owned and operated by BestStart Educare Ltd. BestStart is a large national organisation that owns a number of early childhood services across New Zealand.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy was developed collaboratively with leaders, teachers, parents and whānau. Leaders should consider ways they can develop indicators of good practice that guide and support the key valued outcomes for children. Further engaging with whānau Māori and their pacific community to deepen their understanding of what educational success looks like for them and their children in this context would enrich this.</p><p>Children participate in an environment that promotes a sense of belonging. They experience warm and respectful relationships. Their resilience, independence and social competence are fostered throughout the centre. Challenge, curiosity and creativity are encouraged. Teachers work alongside children supporting and affirming their play and learning. Older children learn and play confidently and collaboratively in peer groups. Tuakana teina interactions are actively encouraged.</p><p>Teachers sensitively respond to and support infants’ and toddlers’ needs for strong and secure relationships. These young children confidently explore the well-considered learning environment at their own pace.</p><p>Effective collaborative systems are in place to promote the learning and wellbeing of children with diverse needs. Teachers work in partnership with the families, whānau and outside agencies to plan and monitor their progress.</p><p>Te ao Māori is promoted and evident in the centre. A key feature of the programme is regular excursions into the community to develop children's sense of place and connectedness with sites of significant value to Māori. A next step is to enrich the bicultural programme through more consistent use of te reo Māori in everyday practice in the centre.</p><p>A useful individualised planning for learning framework responsive to whānau aspirations and dispositional learning, is developing across the centre. Leaders and teachers should ensure that assessment documentation consistently shows how planned teaching strategies have purposefully extended children’s learning, with clear evidence of improved outcomes.</p><p>A sound appraisal system is in place to support and grow teachers' capability. Teachers use an inquiry-based approach to strengthen their practice. Observations help to identify good practice and inform next steps for development. Leaders identified the need to align teachers' development goals to the centre philosophy and strategic plan. ERO's external evaluation affirms this direction.</p><p>The professional service management team provides feedback, support and guidance for the centre manager and teaching team. BestStart provides a range of professional learning and development opportunities for staff.</p><p>An effective internal evaluation process with clear expectations is implemented. Leaders work collaboratively with the centre manager and teaching team to build their evaluative understanding. Teachers are beginning to build their knowledge to evaluate the impact of their practices on children’s learning.</p><p>Strong positive leadership, based on relational trust is in place. Teachers are highly collaborative and committed to the vision, values and philosophy of the centre. They are responsive to the changing needs of children, families and whānau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop indicators of good practice that support the effective implementation of the centre's philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen teachers' understanding of what educational success looks like for Māori and Pacific children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encourage teachers to use te reo Māori in their practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance aspects of the assessment, planning and evaluation cycle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>align strategic goals and the centre's philosophy to the appraisal system.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of BestStart Paraparaumu completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of BestStart Paraparaumu will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>22 August 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
