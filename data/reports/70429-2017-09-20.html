</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>First Steps Pioneer is operated by the BestStart group. The service is led by a centre manager and head teacher. A BestStart Business Manager and BestStart Professional Services Manager visit regularly to support the service.</p><p>Most teachers are qualified early childhood teachers. The current centre manager started at the centre in mid 2016. Ongoing staff changes in the last three years have impacted on the progress made in regard to some centre developments.</p><p>First Steps Pioneer provides full-day education and care for up to 36 children from birth to school age. The centre has separate nursery and preschool areas, each with its own outdoor space. Changes made to the physical environment have included improving the changing facilities.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s individual learning and social needs are well supported. They are actively involved in the programme. Teachers are responsive to individual needs. They notice children’s interests and learning dispositions and use this information effectively to respond to children within the programme.</p><p>Teachers use a range of different strategies to engage children in conversations. Unhurried, flexible routines support children’s learning and provide them with periods of uninterrupted play. Children have many opportunities to hear te reo Māori and learn about tikanga Māori.</p><p>Children are provided with an interesting range of activities and experiences that offer choice, challenge and opportunities for exploration. Older children are encouraged to be independent and develop leadership skills.</p><p>Children in the nursery benefit from nurturing relationships and positive interactions in a small group setting. Teachers follow home routines closely and focus on meeting children’s individual needs. They provide time for infants and toddlers to explore in unhurried ways.</p><p>Teachers effectively assess the learning environment regularly and consider the impacts of physical spaces on children’s learning. They make alterations as needed to improve outcomes for children’s learning and ensure resources are readily available.</p><p>Parents are welcomed into the centre and kept well informed. Teachers seek parents’ opinions and emphasise positive interactions, creating positive relationships with children and their families.</p><p>The new teaching team is effectively building a reflective culture. They have undertaken regular reviews of aspects of the centre programme and practices to develop shared understandings of practice and build a consistent approach. Managers make good use of staff strengths to support practice in particular areas.</p><p>The centre manager is well supported by BestStart management. They implement systems to ensure accountability and provide regular feedback about aspects of the centre’s programme and practices. Managers have clear expectations for teaching and learning and appropriate systems for supporting teachers' and leaders' capability and professional growth.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, BestStart managers and the centre leaders agree that the teaching team is in the early stages of implementing and embedding some practices that would enhance the curriculum and improve outcomes for children.</p><p>These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>finding out about the aspirations Māori whānau have for their children, and ensuring teachers make use of this information to support Māori learners to experience educational success as Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recognising children’s language, culture and identity more across the programme, environment and in learning documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing and strengthening planning and assessment practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using internal evaluation more purposefully to improve outcomes for children, and evaluate the effectiveness of the curriculum and teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>continuing to extend relationships with local schools to support children's successful transition to school.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of First Steps Pioneer completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of First Steps Pioneer will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer - Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>20 September 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a>.</p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
