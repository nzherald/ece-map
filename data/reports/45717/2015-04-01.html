</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Montessori 3-6 Trilingual Early Childhood Education is a privately owned service catering for 30 children between the ages of two and a half and six years. The centre evolved from Manaakitanga Montessori which was established in 2008 as a Puna Kohungahunga, trilingual parent-led service.</p><p>Children may attend full time, five days per week. Morning or afternoon options are also available. The programme includes an introduction to te reo Māori and Spanish language. Families and teachers represent a range of cultures and ethnic backgrounds. Of the children enrolled, 15 identify as Māori.</p><p>Staffing has been stable over time. A core group of five full-time teachers, including the pouwhakahaere (founder/team leader), is supported by part-time staff and two bilingual language assistants.</p><p>The September 2013 ERO review found significant development was needed particularly in relation to the quality of self review and teaching. Key next steps were identified which included developing the quality of assessment and positive guidance for children, and the range of opportunities in the outdoor play area, particularly for boys.</p><p>Since that time, the pouwhakahaere and staff have received targeted support to further develop their practice through self-funded professional learning and development, and a Ministry of Education funded programme, <em>Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities</em> (SELO).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The pouwhakahaere and teaching team have made good progress in improving centre practice and operations. Professional development has supported greater understanding about quality and accountability in early childhood education.</p><p>The environment is carefully organised to facilitate children’s access to a range of materials and learning experiences. Since the previous ERO review, additional resources have been purchased and some development of the outdoor area has been undertaken. Increased choices for outdoor play are enjoyed by the children.</p><p>Staff work well as a team to engage children’s interest in activities and settle them into the life of the centre. They are strongly focused on assisting children to use the Montessori materials, complete tasks, and recording their progress through the Montessori programme. Positive guidance is well used to support children’s social learning, emphasising independent action, wise decision making and the development of respectful relationships with others. Appropriate support is accessed for children with additional learning needs.</p><p>Suitable practices are in place to support children’s transition to primary school. Teachers should continue to explore links between early childhood and primary programmes and ways of sharing individual children’s early learning and progress with new-entrant teachers.</p><p>Some progress has been made in integrating aspects of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and the Montessori approach. The centre environment, guiding curriculum documents and children’s work books and photo albums now include reference to the principles and strands of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, alongside the Montessori elements. Teachers should continue to work on supporting families’ understanding of <em>Te Whāriki</em> and recognising and responding to children’s emerging interests as they explore the environment and resources available. Supporting teachers to work in depth with the goals, dispositions and learning outcomes of <em>Te Whāriki</em> and using these as a basis for evaluation is a next step.</p><p>Families and whānau are welcomed as partners in their children’s learning. Carefully considered opportunities for discussion, including initiatives such as home visiting and weekend discovery journeys, allow families to share children’s interests and aspects of their lives. Children are encouraged to lead discussions with their parents about their learning. Families’ feedback about the programme is sought and valued.</p><p>Families’ cultures, languages and identities are acknowledged. A bicultural perspective is strongly evident through the authentic integration of the language and some protocols. The pouwhakahaere has accessed up-to-date of Ministry of Education resources to further support staff in working with Māori learners. These elements, along with the strong relationships with families and whānau, should contribute to practices that acknowledge and support children’s success as learners in their own cultures and effectively identify and meet family and community needs.</p><p>The pouwhakahaere is providing good support for teachers’ development. She encourages regular reflection on their practice and discussion focused on outcomes for children. Staff appraisal is beginning to be a useful, constructive and well documented process linked to professional teaching requirements. A process of peer feedback is helping teachers to support each other to identify strengths and personal goals, and develop the sense of team. Staff have access to regular professional learning opportunities.</p><p>A strong commitment to developing a more effective self-review process resulted from the findings of the previous ERO review. The use of an appropriate framework, increased knowledge about self review and improvement to aspects of practice are evident. The pouwhakahaere should now work with staff to promote their understanding and involvement in a more evaluative process that supports sustained and improved practice.</p><p>A vision, revised philosophy and long-term plans for development of the centre and leadership are in place. Further definition and refinement of priorities linked to the vision should clarify direction for development and support the monitoring and measurement of progress.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The pouwhakahaere and staff should continue to focus on strengthening practice to improve outcomes for children. ERO and the pouwhakahaere have agreed the next development steps should be:</p><ul>
<li>continued integration of <em>Te Whāriki</em> in curriculum and assessment practices</li>
<li>the further definition of strategic priorities to support monitoring and measurement of progress</li>
<li>supporting teachers’ shared understanding and use of self review to sustain practice and promote improvement.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Montessori 3-6 Trilingual Early Childhood Education completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice the pouwhakahaere should ensure that quality assurance is strengthened in relation to ensuring ongoing compliance with all legal requirements linked to health and safety practices.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Montessori 3-6 Trilingual Early Childhood Education will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>1 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
