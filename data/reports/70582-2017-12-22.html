</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Estuary Road Preschool Limited is a privately-owned centre providing care and education for babies, toddlers and children to school age. A centre manager oversees the daily operation of the centre. Most staff are registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>This centre is one of two centres owned by the same service provider. The other centre is Templeton Nursery and Preschool. A curriculum leader works across both centres. She provides support and guidance to this centre in curriculum and planning.</p><p>The centre was significantly rebuilt in 2016 to better meet the 2008 Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations. There are separate nursery and preschool buildings with distinct outdoor areas.</p><p>The centre owner and leaders have made good use of the support they received from the Ministry of Education and professional development providers to improve the areas identified for development in the 2015 ERO report. The most improvement has occurred in appraisal, strategic planning and internal evaluation practices.</p><p>The centre is an active member of a local learning cluster with other early childhood services and schools.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A collaboratively developed and well defined philosophy helps guide centre practices. There are appropriate systems in place to ensure the regular review of the philosophy.</p><p>Teachers provide a curriculum with a wide range of learning opportunities where:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>children's self-help and independence skills are well supported</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>routines are calm and unhurried, providing flexibility for infants, toddlers and children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children have regular opportunities to hear and use te reo and tikanga Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children's opportunities to interact and learn to play successfully with others are encouraged.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers interact with infants, toddlers and children in ways that are positive and affirming. They make sure infants and toddlers are supported by adults who are familiar to them and who know them well. They actively seek parent's aspirations for children's learning and are beginning to make more use of this information in planning and assessment practices.</p><p>Teachers promote children taking the lead in their play and following their own interests and ideas. They join children in their play and extend oral language and conversation skills.</p><p>Curriculum leadership is actively supporting improved teacher practice in assessment, planning and evaluation. Teachers consistently recognise individual children's interests and learning tendencies. They are developing more consistent documentation of how they are responding to and evaluating children's learning.</p><p>The centre culture is becoming increasingly reflective and supportive at improving professional practice among teachers. Appraisal practices have been strengthened. Centre leaders are providing appropriate support for professional dialogue.</p><p>Centre leaders have a greater understanding of internal evaluation processes as a result of professional development. Evaluation has been useful in identifying strategic goals for centre improvement and planning to support the achievement of these goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders and ERO agree that to improve outcomes for children, the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>complete and embed new planning, assessment and evaluation initiatives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase the focus on outcomes for children and the effectiveness of teaching practices in internal evaluation, strategic planning, planning and assessment, and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a clearer appraisal process for centre managers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support teachers to become more familiar with Tātaiako and how this is reflected in centre practices to more effectively support educational success for Māori children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Estuary Road Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Estuary Road Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>22 December 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <i>E<a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">RO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a></i><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
