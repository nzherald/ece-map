</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Windy Ridge Playcentre provides for up to 30 children and their families. The playcentre is cooperatively managed and families who are members implement the programmes for children. Centre practices are based on the playcentre philosophy of families learning and growing together. The centre offers three family sessions each week and a ‘Big Kids’ session for older children. A paid co-ordinator is employed to lead this session.</p><p>Good quality practices identified in ERO’s 2010 report remain evident. In the past three years, a group of experienced and newer members have worked together to further improve the quality of teaching and learning, curriculum implementation and long-term planning.</p><p>The playcentre operates as part of the North Shore Playcentre Association, an umbrella organisation for twenty one playcentres situated in North Auckland. Many of these centres are semi-rural. The Association manages and distributes centres’ funding and provides a training programme for parents/whānau to achieve Playcentre qualifications. It also has good systems to support centre members to manage the playcentres and to provide educational programmes for children. The association is currently reviewing many aspects of its operations to help reduce the administrative workload for its members.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of twelve playcentre reviews in the North Shore Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are regularly involved in meaningful and sustained play. The play centre’s tone is calm and settled. Infants and toddlers are encouraged to explore and make decisions and have free access to a well-resourced environment. Older children have frequent opportunities to play cooperatively with each other and to express their thoughts and ideas. Respectful and reciprocal relationships between adults and children are a feature of the programme and provide a strong foundation for children’s learning.</p><p>Centre members use effective teaching approaches and skilfully work alongside children. Experienced members model high quality practices and support newer members to develop their understandings. As a result of these good practices, children are engaged in complex play and empowered to take responsibility for their learning.</p><p>The playcentre’s curriculum is guided by <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the New Zealand early childhood curriculum and the belief that children are capable and competent learners. Members have a sound knowledge of a play- based curriculum that is highly responsive to children’s emerging interests. They work together, contributing their ideas and interests to enrich children’s experiences. Members document children’s learning in well presented and easily accessible individual portfolios.</p><p>The centre is effectively managed. Members work collaboratively to promote a high level of engagement and belief in the centre’s vision. They are regularly involved in playcentre training. Established mentoring and ‘buddy’ systems have resulted in a confident group of members who are strategic and reflective in their approach to centre development. Focused and purposeful self review contributes to a culture of ongoing improvement and sustainability.</p><p>A bicultural partnership with whānau Māori is evident in association operations. The management team have a strong commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and to building both adults’ and children’s familiarity with te reo and tikanga Māori. Members at Windy Ridge Playcentre plan to review how they could further support tamariki Māori and their whānau to experience belonging and success at the centre.</p><p>The association management team takes responsibility for specific tasks relating to the function of the association. They are committed to and enthusiastic about their involvement in playcentre and actively foster emergent leadership to help sustain the association. The management team demonstrates the professional leadership necessary to help the association respond to change, make decisions and manage issues as they arise.</p><p>The Association provides effective support to help Windy Ridge Playcentre remain very well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children. Members particularly appreciate the support and guidance provided by the field officer.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To enhance existing high quality practices, ERO and centre members agree that members could:</p><ul>
<li>continue to strengthen their focus on children’s learning in assessment and self-review records</li>
<li>follow up on identified next steps to extend children’s learning and show their progress over time.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Windy Ridge Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Windy Ridge Playcentre will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>25 November 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
