</table><p>Piccolini Private Nursery and Kindergarten Havelock North is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Piccolini Private Nursery and Kindergarten Havelock North is a privately owned and operated early learning service for up to 109 children, including 30 children aged up to two years. At the time of this ERO evaluation there are 83 children enrolled including 12 who identify as Māori.</p><p>Prior to 2018, there were two Piccolini services adjacent to each other in Havelock North. At the beginning of 2018 these services combined and moved to larger premises operating under one licence. Two distinct areas within the building cater for nursery and kindergarten children.</p><p>The Piccolini philosophy reflects the expectation of a values-based early learning service. It is expected that children will feel loved and accepted, have fun and learn and develop to their greatest potential.</p><p>Staffing has remained stable with high numbers of registered teachers employed. Governance and management has continued to develop since the 2016 ERO evaluation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Continuous improvement through internal evaluation focuses on positive outcomes for children. Their sense of belonging is highly promoted to support their developing confidence, competence and independence as successful lifelong learners.</p><p>Parents are valued partners in their children's education and care. Internal evaluation effectively provides the service with strategies to identify what is working well and where improvements are needed. Teachers have focused their recent internal evaluation on the effectiveness of the service in regard to parent aspirations. Ongoing daily discussions with parents and surveys provide teachers with valuable feedback to continue to develop processes. Information indicates that parents are satisfied with the quality of education and care their children receive.</p><p>Children make decisions and choices about their learning in a supportive and inclusive environment. Assessment, planning and evaluation practices enable teachers to know individual children well and to recognise and promote their strengths and interests. Teachers identify high quality teaching strategies that support individual children's learning needs.</p><p>The philosophy is highly evident in practice. The curriculum is well developed and reflects the underpinnings and intent of <em>Te Whāriki.</em> Through internal evaluation teachers identify what is working well and what more needs to be done.</p><p>Māori children and their whānau are respected by staff for the rich experiences they bring to their learning. Teachers have worked positively to provide an environment that respects and acknowledges te reo me ngā tikanga Māori. Leaders and teachers have identified that evaluating how well the service promotes children's language, culture and identity will further support Māori children's success as Māori.</p><p>Respectful practices are highly evident. Teachers are attentive to infants, toddlers and young children. They encourage all children to make choices which allows very young children to develop independence. Staff work closely with parents to ensure that children's routines and care needs are implemented to reflect home experiences as closely as possible.</p><p>Well considered and successful transition processes are embedded and promote children's sense of security and wellbeing. Within the centre, younger children interact positively and regularly with older children. The foundations for successful transitions from the nursery to the kindergarten environment are seamless. The service has developed and maintained a very strong working partnership with the local school. Teachers share children's learning to make transitions to school a positive experience for children and their families.</p><p>Collaborative leadership has a clear focus on supporting children to experience positive outcomes. Mentors provide appropriate support to provisionally certified teachers and student teachers. Focus on a professional learning culture to provide children with high quality education and care is evident.</p><p>The service's strategic goals are clearly focused on positive learning outcomes for children and the expectation for how this will happen. This links well with the service philosophy and is reflected in practice across all areas of the service's operation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Continue to use effective internal evaluation to determine how well the service is meeting the needs of all children and their families and what ongoing steps can be taken to improve performance.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Piccolini Private Nursery and Kindergarten Havelock North completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Piccolini Private Nursery and Kindergarten Havelock North will be in four years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>1 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
