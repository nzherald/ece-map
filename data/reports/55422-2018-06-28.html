</table><p>Robust systems and processes are not yet in place to support sustained and ongoing improvements needed in the curriculum, leadership, teaching practices and compliance with all legislative requirements</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>High Five Early Education Centre is a privately owned service providing education and care for up to 55 children, including 20 aged up to two years. The centre comprises three learning areas: one for infants (aged under 20 months); one for toddlers aged up to three years (junior school); and one for children over three years old (senior school). The groups combine occasionally according to numbers, staffing, and shared activities.</p><p>The philosophy and vision highlight the importance of children being children within an environment that has a family atmosphere.</p><p>A managing director/owner oversees the business operation. A centre manager is the pedagogical leader, responsible for the day-to-day organisation, teaching and learning. She is supported by room/team leaders.</p><p>The September 2015 ERO report of the service identified significant areas of non-compliance relating to teaching practices, governance and management, and human resources. Ongoing support from the Ministry of Education was provided to support the centre to meet licensing requirements.</p><p>Although some progress is evident, the service has not sufficiently addressed the areas requiring improvement. Further development is required for the service to be well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Further work is required to improve curriculum design, teaching and assessment practices and internal evaluation. Systems to monitor health and safety procedures and the review of centre policies need to be sufficiently robust to ensure that legislative requirements are consistently met.</p><p>Leaders and teachers should continue to deepen their understanding of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and strengthen their understanding of best practice linked to teaching and learning.</p><p>Creating a co-ordinated approach to assessment, planning and evaluation that is responsive to individual children is a priority. Leaders have developed a useful framework that should provide good support for teachers to strengthen their understanding of planning and assessment. However, deliberate planning for, and evaluation of, individual children's learning to better inform decisions about the curriculum, is not yet in place.</p><p>Regular self review that leads to some change is established. Leaders are building their knowledge of internal evaluation. Developing the teaching team's evaluative capacity to measure the quality and value of programmes and operation remains a priority.</p><p>Responsive relationships are evident between children, teachers, and parents. Flexible transitions in to the service are sensitively managed to meet the needs of children and their families. Primary caregiving promotes a sense of belonging and security for infants and toddlers. Tuakana teina is valued, and siblings are supported to maintain close connections with each other during the day.</p><p>Aspects of the philosophy are evident in practice. Developing children's sense of belonging and establishing close relationships with whānau are priorities. Leaders have identified that further strengthening teaching practice to consistently reflect the philosophy and priorities for children's learning is a next step. ERO's external evaluation confirms this.</p><p>Older children's exploration of literacy, mathematics and science concepts is supported by access to a range of suitable resources. Teachers use Pacific music to promote early numeracy development.</p><p>Children have opportunities to participate in waiata, karakia, pūrakau and meaningful literacy experiences. Teachers should continue to improve their understanding of te ao Māori concepts and use of te reo Māori. Strengthening learning partnerships with whānau Māori, to better inform individual planning is a key next step.</p><p>Connections between home and the service are used well to promote children's sense of belonging. Their cultures are evident within the environment and are beginning to emerge in children's assessment records. Leaders have identified that continuing to strengthen relationships with Pacific families and their communities is a key next step.</p><p>The appraisal process has been strengthened to provide better support for teachers to reflect on their practice in relation to professional requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key priorities for improvement are:</p><ul>
<li>systems for identification, monitoring and assurance of all legislative requirements</li>
<li>leadership to guide professional practice to promote high quality education and care</li>
<li>shared understanding and use of internal evaluation for improvement</li>
<li>clear indicators of good practice that align to the service's philosophy and identified priorities for learning</li>
<li>learning partnerships with Māori and Pacific whānau to inform individual planning</li>
<li>planning, assessment and evaluation practices that respond to the learning needs of individual children and align to the principles, strands and outcomes of <em>Te Whāriki</em>.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of High Five Early Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to children's health and wellbeing and governance and management. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>when children leave premise on an excursion parents/caregivers have given prior written approval to their child's participation and have sighted the proposed ratio for special excursions prior to the excursion taking place</li>
<li>records of all medicine (prescription and non-prescription) given to children attending the service include evidence of parental acknowledgement</li>
<li>safe and hygienic animal handling practices are implemented with regards to any animals at the service</li>
<li>records of all injuries, illnesses and incidents that occur at the service include evidence that parents have been informed</li>
<li>the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>, and <em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres, 2008</em> are prominently displayed at the service for parents and visitors</li>
<li>the service is effectively governed and managed in accordance with good management practices and that legislative requirements are consistently met.</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008,</em> HS17, HS28, HS16, HS27, HS34, GMA1, GMA7 and HS5]</p><p>Since the on-site stage of this evaluation the service has:</p><ul>
<li>provided evidence for one excursion that demonstrates how the criteria is met</li>
<li>developed systems to monitor records for administering medication</li>
<li>developed a flowchart setting out expectations for responding to incidents and events</li>
<li>developed policies and practices related to animal welfare</li>
<li>prominently displayed documents for parents and visitors.</li>
</ul><p>ERO will continue to monitor compliance and evaluate the effectiveness of implementation to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of High Five Early Education Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>28 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 614px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review<a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"></a></h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
