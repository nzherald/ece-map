<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2>
<p>Mt Albert Playcentre provides a high quality learning programme for children from birth to school age. Located in a residential area of Mt Albert, the Playcentre operates as part of the Auckland Playcentres Association. The Association provides guidance and support with administration and professional development.</p>
<p>Children benefit from many opportunities that parents provide to initiate and sustain complex play. They are able to develop as capable, competent learners in the centre&rsquo;s environments that are thoughtfully presented and challenging. Children enjoy caring, positive and respectful relationships with the adults, who know them well. Mixed age play is well supported and supervised. Children include others in their play. They are confident to approach adults and work away from their own parents for large parts of the session.</p>
<p>Adults support younger children to develop age-appropriate competencies. They promote children&rsquo;s creativity and critical thinking. Open-ended conversations promote learning and there are rich opportunities for children to develop early literacy, mathematics and science skills. Centre members have high levels of expertise and provide good support for each other. They have developed a shared understanding of Playcentre philosophy and apply this in consistent, high quality ways.</p>
<p>Centre members have developed good quality assessment processes. Portfolios are attractive and valuable records of childrens' learning. Adults are highly responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and use evaluation effectively to refine the programme. The programme supports individual children&rsquo;s interests well. Centre members are well positioned to further explore ways to encourage children to evaluate their own learning and development.</p>
<p>The centre has well established and useful decision-making processes. Adults share key roles and responsibilities and build the capacity of newer members. Centre members value the contribution of M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau and are committed to using te reo M&#257;ori. Self review is effective and informs centre operations and enhances learning opportunities for children. Further refinements to strategic planning could help develop the capacity of all centre members to promote biculturalism in the programme.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, centre members of Mt Albert Playcentre were invited to consider priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and centre members. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atMt Albert Playcentre.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The 2009 ERO report commended centre members for their high quality practice and responsiveness to children&rsquo;s interests. Centre members have maintained these high standards and have responded well to recommendations.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p>Positive atmosphere. Centre members and children work in partnership and this creates a happy, settled and caring feel to the centre. Through their shared philosophy and high levels of parent education, centre members actively promote the culture which is based on:</p>
<ul><li>respectful relationships which value children&rsquo;s and adults&rsquo; contributions</li>
<li>welcoming, friendly interactions which help families to settle quickly</li>
<li>flexible routines to support children&rsquo;s self help and independence</li>
<li>using music in meaningful ways to reflect the culture and heritage of learners</li>
<li>consistent expectations and positive language.</li>
</ul><p>Outcomes for children. Children have many opportunities to develop as confident and capable learners. They invite others to play and respect each other&rsquo;s expertise and contributions. Children&rsquo;s social and emotional competence is well supported which further promotes their sense of belonging and wellbeing.</p>
<p>Programme. The high quality programme is characterised by many opportunities for children to initiate and sustain play in complex ways. Adults are responsive to children&rsquo;s interests. They make consistent use of open ended questioning and active listening to challenge children&rsquo;s thinking and promote new learning. Meaningful play to support early literacy and mathematics skills includes a relevant and interesting focus on science and the natural world. Well supervised mixed age play promotes children&rsquo;s leadership skills.</p>
<p>Learning environments. Well resourced learning environments are attractive and accessible. Children are supported to use materials in interesting ways and move resources around the centre to enhance their play. Children are encouraged to explore environments and frequently engage in creative and messy play. Outdoor equipment is challenging and supports children to play collaboratively and in small groups. Children have easy access to the outdoors and enjoy opportunities to be physically active and independent.</p>
<p>Portfolios and assessment. Children&rsquo;s portfolios are attractive records of their interests and achievements. Parents make many valuable contributions to children&rsquo;s learning. Children enjoy and value their portfolios. Learning is well analysed and identifies some next learning steps. Centre members make good use of each others&rsquo; expertise and knowledge to document children&rsquo;s progress. It would be beneficial for children if centre members found more ways for children to evaluate their learning. Documenting these evaluations could further inform learning.</p>
<p>Parent involvement. Parents show a high level of commitment to the playcentre. Centre members report they appreciate opportunities to receive training from the Playcentre Association. They also value the support they receive from each other and the positive impact on their parenting skills. Centre members will continue to explore ways to increase diversity and reflect the local community.</p>
<p>Leadership and self review. Centre members take a variety of leadership roles. New co-ordinators and former co-ordinators work together to ensure smooth transitions. Self review is well developed and used thoughtfully to enhance operations and plan for centre sustainability. Spontaneous and planned review is used to respond to annual plans and children&rsquo;s interests. Session evaluations inform programme planning and build centre members&rsquo; self-review skills.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p>Long term planning and self review. To enhance self review, connecting the strategic plan more comprehensively to the annual plan could enable centre members to more easily evaluate progress towards the strategic goals. The annual plan could be enhanced by adding indicators of progress, expected outcomes and timeframes.</p>
<p>Biculturalism. Centre members have identified and ERO agrees that children could further benefit if the Playcentre added biculturalism to the philosophy and continued to expand adults&rsquo; capacity to use te reo M&#257;ori. Further promoting children&rsquo;s use of te reo M&#257;ori in the programme and increasing opportunities for children to learn about te ao M&#257;ori using partnerships with local iwi could continue to build children&rsquo;s expertise and understandings.</p>
<a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Mt Albert Playcentre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2>
<p>ERO and the centre members agree that the Playcentre could continue to develop their programme and self review to reflect New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage.</p>
<a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>

<p>To the Parents and Community of Mt Albert Playcentre</p>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Mt Albert Playcentre.</p>
<p>Mt Albert Playcentre provides a high quality learning programme for children from birth to school age. Located in a residential area of Mt Albert, the Playcentre operates as part of the Auckland Playcentres Association. The Association provides guidance and support with administration and professional development.</p>
<p>Children benefit from many opportunities that parents provide to initiate and sustain complex play. They are able to develop as capable, competent learners in the centre&rsquo;s environments that are thoughtfully presented and challenging. Children enjoy caring, positive and respectful relationships with the adults, who know them well. Mixed age play is well supported and supervised. Children include others in their play. They are confident to approach adults and work away from their own parents for large parts of the session.</p>
<p>Adults support younger children to develop age-appropriate competencies. They promote children&rsquo;s creativity and critical thinking. Open-ended conversations promote learning and there are rich opportunities for children to develop early literacy, mathematics and science skills. Centre members have high levels of expertise and provide good support for each other. They have developed a shared understanding of Playcentre philosophy and apply this in consistent, high quality ways.</p>
<p>Centre members have developed good quality assessment processes. Portfolios are attractive and valuable records of childrens' learning. Adults are highly responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and use evaluation effectively to refine the programme. The programme supports individual children&rsquo;s interests well. Centre members are well positioned to further explore ways to encourage children to evaluate their own learning and development.</p>
<p>The centre has well established and useful decision-making processes. Adults share key roles and responsibilities and build the capacity of newer members. Centre members value the contribution of M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau and are committed to using te reo M&#257;ori. Self review is effective and informs centre operations and enhances learning opportunities for children. Further refinements to strategic planning could help develop the capacity of all centre members to promote biculturalism in the programme.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p>
<p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
