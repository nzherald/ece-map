</table><p>Little Lights Kindy is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Lights Kindy is located in a semi-rural area on the slopes of Mount Ngongotaha in Rotorua. It is set in extensive grounds with access to nearby paddocks, farm animals and a bush area. The centre provides all-day education and care service for children from birth to school age. Licensed for 50 children, including up to 16 under two years of age, it is organised into two areas, one for children under three and a separate area for children over three. At the time of this ERO review 78 children were enrolled, including 11 who identify as Māori and three from Pacific nations.</p><p>Little Lights Kindy is one of eight centres in the Bay of Plenty region owned by the Evolve Education Group. An area manager, teaching, learning and development manager, and centre support manager provide professional leadership and support to the onsite manager. Since the 2014 ERO review there have been many changes to the teaching team and a new area manager has been appointed.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy is ‘Te aroha te mea nui, o nga mea katoa, te punga o nga mea ko te karaiti’ - love is the key to everything we do, and Jesus is the source of it all.’ Christian beliefs underpin a caring and fun environment where each child feels secure, loved and respected. The centre aims to inspire children, families and staff to shine, valued and reach to their God-given potential in every way.</p><p>The centre has responded positively to the areas identified in the previous ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers use a range of deliberate strategies to enhance learning. They enrich and extend oral language through activities and play. Children’s social competence is promoted and encourages self-management and positive relationships. Teachers have an understanding of each child and they effectively support their learning. Some use of te reo Māori is naturally integrated into the daily life of the centre. This promotes a sense of belonging for Māori children. Leaders and teachers acknowledge the need to continue to strengthen the celebration and enhancement of language, culture and identify for Māori, Pacific and other children in the centre programme.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years enjoy secure, warm, calm and responsive relationships. A strong sense of belonging is promoted. Children benefit from the opportunity to play and learn in a purpose built environment.</p><p>The centre’s curriculum effectively caters for the needs of all children. A wide range of resources encourage creativity, exploration and independence. An extensive natural environment supports learning through authentic contexts. The environment promotes choice, there is a calm atmosphere and children can learn at their own pace. Children are able to engage in sustained and uninterrupted independent play. They are well engaged in a rich and varied curriculum.</p><p>Learning portfolios are a thorough summary of children's learning and play. Children’s progress and development are reviewed to inform positive transitions within the centre. There is an inclusive approach to supporting children with additional learning needs and their families.</p><p>Leadership is building a collaborative team to enhance positive outcomes. A team approach to identifying and discussing the learning needs of children promotes consistency in responding to their needs. Positive partnerships for learning are promoted through regular communication with parents and whānau. Leaders should continue to develop teacher capability in inquiry to further improve outcomes for children.</p><p>Comprehensive systems and processes guide all centre operations. There has been clear identification of the service’s priorities through strategic planning, including strengthening bicultural practices. Effective policy review is informed by parents and whānau. Clear frameworks for appraisal and self review are supporting ongoing centre improvement. Leaders effectively support teachers through professional learning and development, and coaching and mentoring. Children benefit from a well-managed centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers now need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop a shared understanding of priorities for children’s learning informed by <em>Te Whāriki,</em> The New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further clarify the values that underpin centre operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further strengthen planning and assessment to meet the individual needs of all children and identify their next steps for learning</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Lights Kindy completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should fully embed the organisation's hazard identification process.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Lights Kindy will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>25 February 2019</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
