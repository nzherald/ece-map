<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Miramar Central Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>A recent positive initiative is Te Manawa, the association&rsquo;s criteria for curriculum implementation. This provides a clear framework for teachers to deliver a high-quality, inclusive early childhood education programme.</p><p>Since the 2008 ERO report significant changes in staff have occurred. Despite these changes teachers have striven to maintain an effective programme for children and to continue to build relationships with wh&#257;nau.</p><p>A settled, cheerful and purposeful tone pervades the kindergarten. Teachers use children&rsquo;s interests to form the basis of the programme. They work alongside children effectively sustaining their engagement and extending their learning.</p><p>Teachers are respectful, responsive and affirming. They effectively encourage children's contributions and support their developing social and language skills.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor learning environments are inviting and well organised. The multicultural diversity of children and their families is valued and celebrated. Building relationships with wh&#257;nau and involving them in the life of the kindergarten is a strong focus.</p><p>Teachers have identified that an area for ongoing improvement is the integration of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori and working with multicultural communities. ERO concurs with this direction. Teaching staff are in the early stages of implementing Te Manawa. When embedded this should assist in strengthening assessment and curriculum implementation. Evidence-based self review to examine and build teacher practice requires further development.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Miramar Central Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atMiramar Central Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The June 2008, ERO review identified that teachers continue to provide a free play programme that effectively supports children&rsquo;s learning and engagement. Since this review several personnel changes in teaching positions have occurred.</p><p>The kindergarten offers session times within an all day licence. Changes made to the outdoor environment have improved safety and added additional physical challenge for children.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Programme</p><p>Child initiated play-based activities form the basis of the programme. Children are actively engaged in a range of interesting learning experiences reflective of their interests. Teachers sensitively enhance and extend children&rsquo;s engagement and learning across the curriculum.</p><p>Routines are flexible and support children&rsquo;s developing independence skills. Children&rsquo;s developing social skills are supported through cooperative play. Teachers encourage parents to contribute to the programme. This enhances the links between home and kindergarten.</p><p>Spontaneous review has been used to improve outcomes for children.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation</p><p>Planning is responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and broadens learning experiences.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s portfolios are well presented and informative. They highlight children&rsquo;s developing relationships and engagement in the programme. The teacher&rsquo;s role in supporting the child&rsquo;s learning is made evident and links are drawn between entries to show continuity of learning.</p><p>Environment</p><p>The kindergarten is well resourced and is a positive learning environment where children are confident to explore. The wide range of learning resources available offer different levels of challenge resulting in children engaging in play for extended periods.</p><p>Easy access to indoor and outdoor spaces promotes children&rsquo;s curiosity and exploration. A wide range of movable equipment outdoors adds additional challenge to children&rsquo;s developing physical skills. The atmosphere is calm, settled and purposeful.</p><p>Interactions</p><p>Teachers are warm, welcoming and respectful in their interactions with children and adults. They are responsive and supportive of children and parents particularly during transition times. A strong sense of belonging and partnership is promoted.</p><p>Rich, descriptive language is used by teachers to promote children&rsquo;s language development. Teachers effectively facilitate and extend children&rsquo;s learning through the use of open-ended questions. This promotes thinking and additional learning opportunities. Children who have English as a second language are well supported by teachers who draw on a range of strategies to engage them in learning.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation Teachers and ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation identifies that assessment documentation should be further developed by providing entries that:</p><ul>
<li>more regularly document planned and implemented strategies that show how depth and complexity has been added to children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>show children&rsquo;s learning and progress</li>
<li>increase opportunities for parent contributions.</li>
</ul><p>Programme evaluations should be documented to further support teachers to make judgements about the quality and effectiveness of the experiences provided and the impact on children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Self review Teachers have identified that evidence-based self review requires further development. ERO agrees with this direction. A full cycle of review has yet to be completed and teachers are unsure about the difference between development and review. To improve teachers&rsquo; ability to review, consideration should be given to framing reviews around an evaluative question. The implementation of rigorous self review should promote ongoing development and foster sustained improvement overtime.</p><p>Bicultural programme Teachers have identified and ERO agrees that they should continue to strengthen their bicultural programme.</p><p>Multicultural programme The teaching team has shown a commitment to increasing its knowledge of working with children and families who have English as a second language. Supporting children&rsquo;s learning and families&rsquo; engagement in the programme could be strengthened through considering parental aspirations and how assessment information is shared.</p><h3>Association Support</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</li>
<li>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</li>
<li>a wide range of professional development opportunities</li>
<li>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</li>
</ul><h4><span>Areas for development and review</span></h4><p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen their support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</li>
<li>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice, as a result of feedback</li>
<li>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association strategic priorities.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
</ul><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Although no children with moderate to severe special learning needs are enrolled in the kindergarten, teachers are committed to providing a welcoming inclusive environment for all learners. The association has a policy and procedures to ensure children attending the kindergarten are respected as learners and have equitable access to support and resources for learning.</p><p>The physical environment is spacious and open-ended resources provide opportunities for children to play independently or as part of a group. Teachers indicate that the varying levels of the outdoor environment may inhibit some children&rsquo;s ability to make full use of the playground.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Miramar Central Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist.

</table><p>13 January 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-miramar-central-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Miramar Central Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Miramar Central Kindergarten.</p><p>Miramar Central Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p>A recent positive initiative is Te Manawa, the association&rsquo;s criteria for curriculum implementation. This provides a clear framework for teachers to deliver a high-quality, inclusive early childhood education programme.</p><p>Since the 2008 ERO report significant changes in staff have occurred. Despite these changes teachers have striven to maintain an effective programme for children and to continue to build relationships with wh&#257;nau.</p><p>A settled, cheerful and purposeful tone pervades the kindergarten. Teachers use children&rsquo;s interests to form the basis of the programme. They work alongside children effectively sustaining their engagement and extending their learning.</p><p>Teachers are respectful, responsive and affirming. They effectively encourage children's contributions and support their developing social and language skills.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor learning environments are inviting and well organised. The multicultural diversity of children and their families is valued and celebrated. Building relationships with wh&#257;nau and involving them in the life of the kindergarten is a strong focus.</p><p>Teachers have identified that an area for ongoing improvement is the integration of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori and working with multicultural communities. ERO concurs with this direction. Teaching staff are in the early stages of implementing Te Manawa. When embedded this should assist in strengthening assessment and curriculum implementation. Evidence-based self review to examine and build teacher practice requires further development.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Kathleen Atkins</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
