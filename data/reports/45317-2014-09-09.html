</table><p>Paula’s Tiny Tots Tahunanui is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Paula’s Tiny Tots Tahunanui provides education and care for infants and toddlers. The centre is owner operated. One of the co-owners is the licensee and centre manager. She is a qualified early childhood teacher and carries out a supportive, mentoring role in the programme.</p><p>Almost all the teachers are qualified. The small roll allows children to enjoy close, nurturing relationships with teachers in a family-like environment. Positive relationships exist between teachers, children and their families.</p><p>The centre managers have used ERO’s April 2011 report to strengthen their self-review process, their assessment procedures and the usefulness of their strategic plan and annual plan. Although progress is evident, the updating of the centre's long-term planning needs to be completed. The use of evaluative questions are likely to achieve the quality the centre desires.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>During the review, ERO observed children happily settled and enthusiastic about their play. They have many activities linked to mathematics, literacy, the arts and physical activity. They have good opportunities to hear te reo Māori. Teachers enjoy the support they receive from Māori parents in using te reo and tikanga Māori.</p><p>The centre staff use the Māori values of manaakitanga (caring and nurturing) and whanaungatanga (family-like relationships) to enhance the positive culture in the centre. The manager strongly supports the teachers’ focus on Māori values and the way these add to the positive relationships in the centre.</p><p>Teachers have developed strong two-way relationships with parents and families. Parents regularly make useful contributions to the centre programme. Centre staff are respectfully supportive of the children and their families. Parents’ wishes for their children are effectively used by teachers to complement their planning.</p><p>Most teachers provide useful information to parents about their children’s progress and learning. In the best examples, teachers:</p><ul>
<li>identify children’s learning and extend on their interests</li>
<li>include feedback from parents and children</li>
<li>identify next steps in learning.</li>
</ul><p>Centre managers have a useful self-review process that focuses on ongoing improvement. This could be further strengthened by staff focusing more on how effectively the programme is meeting outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre is very well led by the supervisor. The centre manager includes the supervisor and assistant supervisor in many decisions about how the centre is run. This includes developing the centre’s long-term plans and managing self review. This approach is building staff capability and maintaining and building on current good practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers and ERO agree that the next key steps for promoting high-quality learning and teaching include extending self-review practices and completing the update of the centre's long term plan.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Paula's Tiny Tots Tahunanui completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Paula's Tiny Tots Tahunanui will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>9 September 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
