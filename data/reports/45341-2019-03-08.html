</table><p>Parua Bay Childcare&nbsp;is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Parua Bay Childcare is a purpose-built centre in a semi-rural, coastal location. The centre is licensed for up to 60 children, including 20 up to the age of 2 years. Two separate rooms accommodate the children, with outdoor areas for children up to two years of age and those over two. Since the last review the centre has changed to private ownership.</p><p>The centre owner is responsible for all administration duties. A centre manager is assisted by a head teacher and teaching team. The majority of teachers are qualified and registered.</p><p>The philosophy prioritises relationships and respect. It also highlights the value placed on providing learning experiences in the natural environment.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report noted the warm relationships and deep respect teachers showed for children and the opportunities for children to learn about caring for the environment. These practices are still evident. The report identified the need to strengthen internal evaluation practices, and develop alignment between the centre's strategic and annual planning. Good progress has been made in these areas. Strengthening planning, assessment and evaluation practices is still in progress.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Respectful and responsive relationships established with families contribute to the children's sense of belonging and community. Children are welcomed into the centre and teachers know their families well. Inclusive practices are evident in the centre.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from good adult to child ratios, and they enjoy warm, nurturing care. Toddlers play in an attractively presented space that encourages them to explore, make discoveries and be independent. Language and communication skills are nurtured through teachers' thoughtful interactions with children.</p><p>Older children are viewed as confident and capable learners. They are busy, and purposefully engage in self chosen play. Children enjoy friendships that enhance their social skills. Teachers encourage them to try things out, problem solve and be independent. Children's knowledge of numeracy, literacy, science and the natural world is extended through their play.</p><p>The respect for the natural world is woven through centre practices and evident in the focus on sustainability. Thoughtfully designed learning spaces are focused around natural resources. The outdoor area promotes imaginative and creative play and physical challenge.</p><p>Teachers seek parent aspirations to support programme planning. Wall displays keep parents informed with children's current interests in the centre. Online ways of documenting children's learning progress enable parents to share this with wider wh&#257;nau.</p><p>Transition practices into and through the centre are well considered and carefully tailored to suit the child and family. Strong relationships with neighbouring schools support children's transition to school.</p><p>The centre's commitment to bicultural practice and embedding te ao M&#257;ori in the programme is a growing strength. Adults use te reo M&#257;ori words, phrases and waiata in routines and conversations.</p><p>The programme is guided by <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers are continuing to enhance their planning, assessment and evaluation practices. Shifting to a stronger focus on child-led learning, investigation and inquiry will also strengthen teaching practice.</p><p>Internal evaluation processes have been established, and continue to be refined. An appraisal system is in place to support teachers' growth and professional development. Appraisal could be strengthened by developing 'teaching as inquiry' approaches, and providing teachers with ongoing feedback from teaching observations.</p><p>The centre is well governed and managed. The owner, manager and team leader work collaboratively to ensure positive outcomes for children. An up-to date policy framework supports centre operations, and the strong strategic and annual plan is future focused.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next key steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>building teachers' capability to critically reflect on their teaching practice, and contribute to robust internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing teachers with ongoing, relevant feedback on their teaching practice through robust appraisal.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Parua Bay Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>8 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <i>ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on ERO&rsquo;s website.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
