</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>St Marys Family Centre is located in Bayfair, Mount Maunganui. The centre is a community-based, not-for-profit service that operates under the governance of the Anglican Parish of Mount Maunganui and the St Mary’s Child Care Governance Board. The centre works in close collaboration with the ‘sister centre’, St Mary's Tahatai Centre, which operates under the same governance structure. The centre is open from 7.30am to 5.30pm on Monday to Friday. It is licensed for 50 children including 21 aged up to two years and has a current roll of 60 including 19 children of Māori descent and a small number of children from diverse ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>The centre includes two age-based areas, one catering for babies and toddlers aged up to two and a half years and another for older preschool children. The centre is staffed by a manager who is responsible for the operation of both areas. She is new to the position since the previous ERO review in 2013. Head teachers in each age-based area provide support and leadership for the teaching team.</p><p>The centre philosophy is strongly centred around relationships, with respect and manaakitanga being the two principles underpinning all interactions. The philosophy documents the intent to provide affordable, high quality education, empowering children to learn and grow within a caring, stable environment. The inclusion of Christian principles and the Anglican ethos of care, respect and equity are also important aspects of the centre philosophy.</p><p>The centre curriculum is based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, the Christian-based 'Fruits of the Spirit' and the Pikler philosophy, which are interwoven to provide an holistic, flexible and child-centred approach to teaching and learning. The curriculum is also responsive to feedback from parents, whānau and the wider centre community. Regular yoga, the church programme, the celebration of cultural festivals including Matariki and Diwali are also important aspects of the centre curriculum.</p><p>St Marys Family Centre prioritises employing qualified teachers. Two are working towards a post graduate diploma in specialist teaching and early intervention endorsement. The centre has responded positively to the areas for improvement identified in the previous ERO report and has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The programme at St Marys Family Centre provides children with many opportunities to make independent choices from a range of attractive and well-presented areas for play, resources and experiences. The centre strongly supports the language, identity and culture of tangata whenua and actively promotes the presence of te ao Māori in the learning environment and teaching practice. This is supporting Māori children and whānau to be secure in their cultural identity within the centre. The programme effectively integrates early mathematical and literacy learning throughout all areas of play and interactions.</p><p>Daily programme planning includes an appropriate combination of teacher-initiated and child-led learning. There are valuable opportunities for children to be part of a group during spontaneous mat times and group activities. The many independent activities planned are responsive to each child's strengths, interests and ideas. The programme is planned to ensure children can experience varied levels of challenge and include a te reo Māori perspective.</p><p>Teachers have undertaken a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of children's transition into, within, and out of the centre to primary school. Successful transitions are supported by effective partnerships between families, the service and local schools.</p><p>The outdoor area is large and well prepared to encourage physical and imaginative play. The area also enables children to experience respect for nature and take part in specific projects. Children are supported to extend and challenge their learning and development about the natural world. This learning is fostering children's sense of mana whenua (belonging) in tamariki and their roles as kaitiaki (guardians of the natural world). The indoor areas are well resourced, large and well prepared to invite children's engagement with play and learning.</p><p>ERO observed that children were happy, settled and confidently approaching adults for support and affirmation. The centre environment enables whānau to join in, feel at ease, and stay as long as they wish. Teachers' interactions are sensitive, appropriate and responsive to children’s wellbeing and learning.</p><p>Teachers are welcoming to children, parents and whānau. When children arrive at the centre key caregiving relationships are established between teachers and children. These relationships support each child’s need for strong secure attachments and relationships. Flexible, unhurried, routines for young children encourage exploration, child choice and independence. There are many opportunities for children to be the leaders of their learning, take risks and to become confident decision makers and communicators.</p><p>Teachers' strategies for managing children's behaviour are highly effective and focused on positive guidance and support. The ‘Guidance Approach Programme’ and respectful practice philosophy fosters children’s social and emotional competence and is developing resilience and self-regulation in children at the centre.</p><p>Leadership maintains a focus on spontaneous, planned and strategic internal review for improvement. Leaders are strongly committed to the philosophy and goals of the service giving priority to equitable outcomes for all children and families. A planned approach to building leadership capacity supports sustainability of the service. Centre leaders have also made strategic appointments and accessed relevant professional learning to strengthen bicultural (te reo/tikanga Māori) practice in the centre. Teachers articulate strong team work, collaborative ways of working and high levels of support from centre leaders.</p><p>Generous provision for regular teachers' professional learning is building teachers' collective capacity and supporting their individual development needs. This development is enabling teachers to be up to date with current research and best practice in early childhood education.</p><p>Teachers, centre leaders, and the trust board are focused on continual improvement, equity and social justice for children and families. The trust is highly supportive of teachers’ professional growth and improvement. There are well-developed processes for reporting and continual internal review at a strategic level and a suitable range of policies and procedures that contribute to a safe and healthy environment for children. Clear reporting frameworks keep trustees well informed about centre operations, developments and outcomes for children and families.</p><p>The partnership with whānau ensures children and their families share a strong sense of belonging to the centre. Teachers record significant learning, milestones and children's achievements in attractive assessment profiles. These documents enable children to revisit important learning and share with parents, teachers and peers. The recent introduction of web-based portfolios is enabling parents and whānau to more easily share children's learning and respond using smart phones, tablets or computers. The centre intends to further develop this initiative to include all children and families. This innovation is enhancing the partnership with parents and whānau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre acknowledge that the further development of parent education initiatives is an additional step to support partnerships with families that are focused on children's learning.</p><p>Centre leaders have also prioritised the further enhancement of appraisal processes so that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers' development goals are more specifically linked to the Practising Teacher Criteria of the Education Council</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal processes include targeted observations of teaching practice in relation to professional goals, with specific feedback about practice and next steps for professional growth.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO agrees that these developments are likely to strengthen outcomes for children and families.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of St Marys Family Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a</p><p>potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of St Marys Family Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>16 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
