<a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2>
</div><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Ladybird Early Childhood Centre is well placed to continue to promote positive outcomes for children. The centre is well established, has a number of long-serving teachers and systems in place to sustain its good practices.<b></b></p><h3>Context</h3><p>The Greytown privately owned and operated centre is open from 7am to 6pm to meet a range of families&rsquo; needs, including commuters to Wellington.</p><p>The centre caters for children aged between two and five years. There is a separate infant and toddlers' centre on the same site. Transition into the centre, and between the two facilities, is well considered. Two distinct programmes appropriately cater for particular age groups.</p><p>The centre has set a vision to provide high quality bilingual education and a caring environment. Its philosophy statement emphasises the provision of a safe, secure and resource rich environment. It promotes positive relationships and values including developing children&rsquo;s independence. The philosophy incorporates a Reggio Emilia approach to teaching and recognises biculturalism.</p><p>This report confirms the strengths identified in ERO's March 2009 review, and also notes that there is a continued need to develop areas identified at that time.&nbsp;</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Key documentation such as the philosophy statement, strategic plan and policies are available to parents and wh&#257;nau and are regularly and consultatively reviewed. The policies appropriately consider children&rsquo;s physical and emotional needs.&nbsp;</p><ul>
<li>The management plan has been developed for three years, ending in 2012. It is timely to consider the next plan and to have a greater focus on outcomes for children.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s 2009 review identified self review as an area for development. Since then the centre has contracted external professional learning and development to meet that need. The focus has been on spontaneous reviews and through this process the centre has identified areas for programme development.&nbsp;</p><ul>
<li>There is still a need to make self review more robust, especially related to strategic self review of the annual plan and implementation of the philosophy.</li>
</ul><p>The owner and some teachers recently attended professional learning and development related to performance appraisal, and have identified strategies to help teachers further develop their knowledge and skills.</p><p>Teachers place a strong emphasis on literacy and mathematics. Children learn Spanish and some te&nbsp;reo M&#257;ori. The parents report that the programme for four-year-olds provides a very sound foundation for transition to school.</p><p>The programmes are planned, based on the child&rsquo;s interests and focus on activities.&nbsp;</p><ul>
<li>The next step is for the assessment, planning and evaluation to have a greater focus on extending children's learning.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Teachers also need to integrate the bicultural practice and philosophy statements more effectively across the curriculum.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers reflect on their practice, and collaboratively discuss ways to support individual children.&nbsp;</p><ul>
<li>It would be useful to document reflections and thinking behind planning decisions in staff meeting notes for future reference.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have warm relationships and clear communication with families.&nbsp; Their interactions with children are positive and contribute the settled tone.&nbsp;</p><p>Teachers are caring, responsive and respectful. They provide good opportunities for these articulate children to extend their language. The children are self motivated, confident in their own ability and stay engaged for sustained periods.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Ladybird Early Childhood Centre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.&nbsp;</p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> National Manager Review Services<br> Central Region (Acting)</p><p>5 October 2012</p><h3>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h3><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
