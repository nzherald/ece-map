</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>City Heights Montessori 2 is one of three centres on the same site in central Dunedin. It provides education and care for up to 58 children aged from approximately three and a half years to school age. Many children come from diverse cultural backgrounds. Programmes in Montessori 2 are in two separate buildings, begin at 9.00am and finish at 3:30pm. Children begin and end their day in an adjacent Montessori centre. The service provides nutritious meals and has recently achieved the Gold Healthy Heart Award.</p><p>There have been significant changes in staff at Montessori 2, as well as changes in staff within the City Heights services since the 2013 ERO review. This includes a new manager for the three centres. The new manager has established leadership roles within the service, including two head teachers to oversee educational programmes in the three centres. Currently there is one head teacher in this role, mainly supporting the other two centres. The manager is seeking a suitably qualified Montessori head teacher to support Montessori 2.</p><p>The manager has led significant developments and made very good progress on the key next steps and actions from the previous ERO report. She has:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>extensively consulted with staff and families to redevelop the City Heights vision and philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developed long and short-term plans to guide the direction of the service and inform decision making</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>introduced systems for monitoring goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>made ongoing improvements to children's play areas.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This review was part of a cluster review of the three centres in the City Heights service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from rich and interesting programmes that emphasise the Montessori approach to teaching and learning. Children are given rich opportunities to develop their thinking, reasoning and creativity skills. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers supporting children's interests to develop into long-term projects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>authentic contexts for literacy and numeracy learning, for example weekly baking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dramatic play, art and creativity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using the skills of the wider family in the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opportunities for children to take the lead in their learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The manager has introduced the expectation of a daily outdoor programme where children can explore with a wide range of materials, learn to garden and care for pets. A recently introduced weekly outing into the local bush provides children with many opportunities for open-ended exploration, and learning about the natural world from a scientific and a Māori perspective.</p><p>Children and their families benefit from the supportive relationships they have with the teachers. Teachers are skilled in the way they identify learning and follow children's interests. Children are well supported as they transition to school. The transition process has improved as a result of recent carefully considered developments.</p><p>The manager has introduced an online tool to support planning for individual children. There are some very good examples of teacher reflection and documentation of individual children's learning. However, planning, assessment and evaluation practices still need to be improved.</p><p>The manager has a strong commitment to including Māori perspectives within the service. This is reflected in long and short-term planning, professional learning for leaders and teachers, involvement in community events and the development of a centre mihi.</p><p>The manager has high expectations for teacher practice and is building this through a new appraisal process and regular professional discussions. She is assisted in her role by the head teacher. With the appointment of a second head teacher, it is time to review the head teacher role to ensure the key focus is on supporting and improving learning programmes and the quality of teaching in the centre.</p><p>The philosophy gives good guidance about what is valued and what is important learning for children at City Heights. Leaders and teachers across the service should use the philosophy to guide curriculum priorities. These desired outcomes for children’s learning need to be more evident in planning and in intentional teaching. The manager has plans to further improve centre environments and should use the philosophy and vision to guide decisions around this.</p><p>Staff turnover and limited uninterrupted time for teacher planning have impacted on the progress of improvements to curriculum design, teaching and learning. The manager and head teachers need to develop assessment, planning and evaluation guidelines to help them and the teachers in their work and support consistency of practice.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation processes require further development across the service. Teachers and leaders need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to find ways to consistently gather parents’ wishes for their children’s learning and development, and show how they respond to children’s language, culture and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>plan strategies and experiences to extend learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies and experiences in supporting children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>show children’s progress over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Group planning needs to consistently show intended priorities for learning and the experiences and intentional teaching to achieve these priorities. Evaluations should show the difference teachers have made to children's learning.</p><p>The manager and some staff have undertaken professional learning and development to improve self-review practices. Whilst this PLD gives a framework for improvement, self review is still a work in progress. To further develop self-review practices, the manager, head teachers and teachers need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure the focus of the review is guided by an evaluative question</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop indicators that guide the review and ensure they match the focus of the review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistently use the indicators throughout the process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that policies and procedures give very clear guidance to staff.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The manager has developed useful systems and processes for the management and leadership of the service. However, she agrees that it is now time to update the policy framework to reflect the service's vision and current practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for the manager, with the support of the leaders are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>redefine the head teacher roles to have greater emphasis on curriculum leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use the philosophy to guide all aspects of the centre operations, including curriculum priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure teams have regular, scheduled and uninterrupted time for planning, assessment and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop planning, assessment and evaluation practices, including guidelines of best practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refine self-review practices and review the policy framework.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of City Heights Montessori 2 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve service practice, risk-management plans for excursions need to be strengthened. The excursions policy needs to give clearer direction to teachers.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of City Heights Montessori 2 will be in three years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>22 July 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
