</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Morrinsville provides education and care services for children from approximately 3 months to school age. The centre had renovations completed in 2014 which increased the inside and outside areas available for children's learning and play within a mixed-age setting. The licence was subsequently increased to a maximum roll of 50 children, with 12 under two years of age. There are currently 70 children enrolled of whom 9 are identified as Māori.</p><p>The centre is privately owned by the umbrella organisation BestStart Educare Ltd. which provides effective governance, leadership and management support underpinned by a clear vision and values. BestStart is committed to providing equitable opportunities for local families to increase their access to early childhood education.</p><p>There is a shared leadership approach to teaching practice and day-to-day operations. Under the coordinating role of the centre manager, all staff are encouraged and supported to contribute to the curriculum, planning and assessment, and self review. The centre retains a high proportion of qualified staff. The centre philosophy includes an emphasis on positive and respectful relationships, inclusive practice, and the incorporation of Māori values and concepts of learning through manaakitanga, kotahitanga, ako and tuakana teina.</p><p>BestStart and centre leaders responded positively to recommendations in the 2013 ERO report. The reporting of children's learning and progress over time has been considerably strengthened, and bicultural practices are far more evident and authentic.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are valued, affirmed and celebrated, first and foremost for who they are and what they bring to their learning. They experience warm, caring and respectful relationships with adults. Familiar routines help children to develop a strong sense of belonging while building social and self-management skills and confidence. In this mixed-age centre positive guidance strategies are used successfully to ensure older children show consideration and support for younger children.</p><p>Bicultural aspects are naturally integrated into staff practice and the centre programme. The manager and teachers have built their knowledge of Ngāti Hauatanga and model the use of te reo Māori. The inclusive and welcoming culture is evident in the way families and whānau are made to feel welcome and supported at the centre. This inclusive culture ensures that the language, identity and culture of all children are respected and valued.</p><p>A safe area has been dedicated for infants and toddlers. Two teachers have specific responsibility for their care and support. At the time of this ERO review, BestStart managers made significant changes to the learning environment for under-two year olds. These changes have provided parents with an alternative access, but still allows children to move easily into the programme and play and learn alongside each other. A calm, settled and respectful area has been created for this mixed-age group.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families very well. Through careful observation, teachers notice and recognise children's strengths and current interests. They share this information at planning meetings, and plan individual development plans (IDPs) for each child. These IDPs are displayed as learning journeys on the walls and reflected in assessment portfolios. There is an increased use of computers and devices to share children's learning experiences and this is considerably increasing the productive partnerships between the centre and home.</p><p>Teachers prepare the environment to support the centre programme. The inside areas encourage children's literacy, creative and imaginative play, and construction activities. The outdoor areas allow for physical challenge and exploration. There is an increased emphasis on natural world experiences and sustainability. All 16 areas of play are reviewed on an annual basis, but these reviews need to be more rigorous and effective to strengthen children's ongoing access to a more complete range of age-appropriate and challenging resources and equipment.</p><p>Children and their families are well supported through their transition to school. The BestStart 'Be School Ready' programme includes an emphasis on early literacy and mathematics, school visits and information for parents.</p><p>The centre manager has built a shared philosophy where each adult has a valued role in contributing to the programme and daily operations. She has successfully built relationships of mutual trust, respect and support with parents, whānau, staff and children. The enhanced appraisal system sets the expectations for teachers to reflect on their own practice and share successful strategies with each other for the benefit of children. In addition, the centre manager has undertaken sustained initiatives to build productive partnerships with local school, iwi, hapū and the wider community.</p><p>Professional and business leaders from the BestStart organisation provide regular oversight, feedback and support for professional growth and development of staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To realise the positive potential of the culturally responsive model of shared leadership, there is a need to continue to develop, and consistently implement, clear and shared expectations for teachers' roles and responsibilities.</p><p>The effectiveness of current self review of the environment and areas of play should be strengthened by reference to specific criteria and indicators. This is likely to result in improved outcomes for children and realisation of the centre's philosophy.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Morrinsville completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Morrinsville will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>11 October 2016</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
