</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Glenfield, on Auckland’s North Shore, is a purpose built centre that opened in 2008. The centre is licensed to provide education and care for 100 children, including up to 25 children under two years of age. It has three age-related areas, with separate rooms for babies and toddlers.</p><p>The centre ownership changed from ABC New Zealand to the Kidicorp organisation in 2012. Its three licensed spaces have also been merged into one licence and Kidicorp personnel and centre management have worked together to develop policies and procedures to meet the 2008 licensing requirements.</p><p>There have also been changes in staff and Kidicorp personnel. Team building has been a focus to support strong, positive relationships. The centre manager is a long-serving staff member.</p><p>Kidicorp continues to provide regular professional development for teachers. The centre manager supervises and takes responsibility for day-to-day centre operations. The assistant manager/head teacher and other head teacher have responsibility for care routines and programme implementation for the different age groups. The teaching team is a mixture of fully and provisionally registered teachers with three teachers currently in training.</p><p>The centre whakatauki ‘Whakapuputia mai o manuka, kia kore ai e whati – cluster the branches of the manuka, so they will not break’ sits alongside the centre’s philosophy. The philosophy is based on respectful relationships, with a focus on the individual child and their family.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre is very inclusive in providing education and care for all children. They play well together, both independently and in small groups. They form warm relationships and engage in respectful conversations with each other and adults. Children benefit from resources and opportunities that enable them to develop good early literacy and numeracy skills. Children can readily access resources and activities that interest them.</p><p>Good staff team work further supports children’s participation in the programme. Teachers take time to have conversations with children to foster their language development. Some teachers encourage the development of children’s early mathematical knowledge during meal and mat times and during children’s play. A necessary next step is for teachers to ensure their interactions with children provoke and stimulate their curiosity, thinking, and problem solving.</p><p>Babies and toddlers are very well cared for in two age related rooms. Teachers know each child and their whānau well. Children each have a staff member who is their primary care giver. This helps with bonding and establishing trust. Teachers respond positively to children and collaborate with parents around children’s personal routines and stages of development. Teachers provide appropriate opportunities that extend children’s exploration and sensory experiences.</p><p>Older children participate in a number of teacher prepared activities. Increasing opportunities for child-initiated activities is a next step to promote higher quality learning for children. Routines are designed to support children’s continuous and independent play. Positive teacher, child, family/whānau relationships support good transition processes within the centre and on to school.</p><p>Planning involves noticing, recognising and responding to children’s individual and group strengths and interests. Planning is displayed and teachers add their written reflections and share plans with parents. Centre management should continue to refine planning and assessment practices to ensure the focus is on children’s individual learning journeys.</p><p>Portfolios of older children’s interests are used to inform teachers’ decisions about how to extend children’s learning. Portfolios for the babies and toddlers record the growth and development of each child.</p><p>Te reo Māori is evident is in waiata, karakia, greetings, words and phrases. The centre manager plans to further develop aspects of bicultural practice with the staff. The use of Ministry of Education resources such as <em>Ka Hikitia-Accelerating Success 2013 - 2017</em> and <em>Tātaiako - Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em>, would support this goal. Teachers should also become familiar with the Ministry’s <em>Pasifika Education Plan 2013 – 2017</em>.</p><p>Centre management values strong pastoral relationships with parents. It would be useful for management to now build on these relationships to increase parents’ engagement in their child’s learning journey.</p><p>Under the umbrella of Kidicorp, the centre manager and teachers are well supported to lead the centre. Systems are implemented effectively to promote the health and wellbeing of staff and children in the centre. Centre management recognise that operating to minimum ratios was causing some challenge to children’s routines and learning. They have increased staffing accordingly.</p><p>Strategic and annual plans are driving centre development. Comprehensive teacher appraisal processes and procedures support ongoing staff development. However, centre management should identify more specifically the priority areas for staff professional development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers and ERO agree that key next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop bicultural practices in the centre and strengthen teachers understanding and skills in promoting te reo and tikanga Māori</li>
<li>continue to strengthen self review to promote ongoing improvement and positive outcomes for children’s learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Glenfield completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Glenfield will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>19 December 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
