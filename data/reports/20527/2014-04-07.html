</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Playhouse Early Childhood Centre is privately owned and located in a modified house in Green Bay. The centre is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 49 children, including 14 up to two years. Children are grouped in two rooms, with the older children occupying the upstairs area of the house. Extensive improvements to the size and layout of the building are planned.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy recognises the importance of a balance between child initiated exploration and teacher provided experiences. Trusting relationships are considered essential to support children to take risks and overcome challenges.</p><p>The owner brings a range of professional skills from previous experience in business, planning and people management. This is balanced by the early childhood experience of the supervisor and office manager. The centre’s management team collaborates well to provide effective governance of the centre and leadership to the team of well-qualified teachers. They use a framework of well-considered plans and policies to guide operations.</p><p>Many of the positive features noted in the 2011 ERO report continue to be evident in the centre. Areas identified for development in 2011 have been the focus of improvement and as a result good progress has been made.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging in the centre. They play and learn together in a calm and settled environment. They are industrious in their play and benefit from being able to engage in uninterrupted play. Children choose whether to play collaboratively or cooperatively with other children or by themselves. Teachers take time to engage with children as individuals and to nurture their development. Children play and interact with adults confidently.</p><p>Teachers respond positively to parents’ preferences for care routines for their children. Infants and toddlers explore their environment freely. They play outdoors alongside and with the older children. As a result of tuakana/teina relationships, children learn from each other and are mutually respectful. The transition of younger children to the older children’s room is supported through these practices.</p><p>Teachers know children well. They share information about children’s interests and development. Teachers increasingly encourage child-initiated learning and notice and respond to children’s dispositions for learning. They record children’s participation in the programme and their learning in portfolios. The care and interest that teachers take in supporting the children’s learning is reflected in the portfolios.</p><p>Teachers plan together for appropriate learning experiences, including project work and regular outings to the local park, library and visits to schools for older children. These outings complement the ways teachers support children to develop confidence and skills in early literacy and numeracy within the context of play.</p><p>The centre management team has prioritised the development of bicultural understanding and practice in the centre’s strategic plan. Teachers have participated in professional development to build their knowledge and confidence in using te reo Māori. Pacific children are well supported and some are able to identify and interact with teachers who speak their home language.</p><p>Teachers use an agreed format for individual and team self review. They develop appropriate individual goals for their appraisal. Manager’s use centre wide goals to maintain their focus on the centre’s strategic priorities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To further enhance the quality of the programme and outcomes for children, ERO agrees with areas for review and development identified by the centre management team. These include:</p><ul>
<li>further developing teachers’ understanding of bicultural practice and the use of te reo Māori in the centre</li>
<li>establishing consistency in how the centre’s philosophy is enacted in teachers’ practice</li>
<li>building teachers’ capacity to support and extend complexity in children’s play</li>
<li>finding ways to gather and respond to contributions parents make in relation to their child’s learning</li>
<li>continuing to build capacity for self review to support ongoing improvement.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Playhouse Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Playhouse Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>7 April 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
