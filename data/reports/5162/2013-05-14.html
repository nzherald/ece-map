<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Thames is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Thames provides education for families in the local community and surrounding rural areas. It provides education and care for up to 40 children over two years of age. It is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday from 8.45 a.m. until 2.45 p.m., and on Wednesday 8.45 a.m. until 1.00 p.m. Most children are of M&#257;ori and P&#257;keh&#257; descent children, with a smaller number of children from other cultures making up the roll.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella organisation, Central North Island Kindergarten Trust (the Trust), previously known as the Central North Island Kindergarten Association. The Trust provides the kindergarten with a clear philosophy, vision, expectations for practice and strategic direction. A knowledgeable and experienced professional leader from the Trust oversees the quality of the service and supports staff professional practice.</p><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy emphasis is to develop positive relationships with links to the local and natural environments, including respect for papatunuku (mother earth). The kindergarten is situated next to a local primary school and continues strong connections and involvement with the school.</p><p>The staff have engaged in a good range of professional development about aspects of current theory and practice in early childhood education. The head teacher continues to strengthen her knowledge and practice in leadership.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in eleven early childhood education services within the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>A continuing strength of the kindergarten is the positive and trusting relationships among teachers and families. Many families have historical links with the kindergarten and comment on the welcoming environment that teachers have maintained. Families feel comfortable to participate and enthusiastically join in kindergarten outings and social events. Children benefit from the high level of family involvement encouraged by teachers.</p><p>Emphasis is placed on fostering children&rsquo;s sense of belonging and wellbeing. Children are well cared for, and supported to develop their confidence, self esteem and independence. Teachers foster good links between the home and kindergarten. They ensure that each child is included and supported to participate positively in the programme.</p><p>As a result of professional development teachers continually adapt the environment to better support children&rsquo;s learning. Furniture and resources reflect those found in the home and encourage sustained learning through social and imaginative play. The environment offers a wide range of options that appeal to children&rsquo;s different ages, interests and strengths.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review teachers have focused on developing environmental and sustainable practices. These include recycling, planting, gardening and daily baking using produce grown by children. Animals play an important role in the programme, providing opportunities for children to care for and take responsibility for their wellbeing. Children are acquiring early science concepts, appreciation and respect for the local environment.</p><p>Teachers have strong links with the neighbouring school, which are maintained through regular visits and involvement in school events. These practices support children when they move on to school. A feature of this kindergarten is its commitment to providing and funding outings to places beyond the local community that children and families might not otherwise experience.</p><p>ERO observed variable teaching practices. While there are some key next steps related to teaching and learning practice, ERO did identify teachers using the following effective practices:</p><ul>
<li>using specific feedback to encourage children&rsquo;s communication and negotiation skills, and supporting children to take increased responsibility for their own behaviour</li>
<li>skilfully integrating literacy and mathematics in their conversations with children</li>
<li>using te reo M&#257;ori naturally to build children&rsquo;s appreciation and use of M&#257;ori as a living language</li>
<li>having sustained learning conversations that extend children&rsquo;s thinking and help them to achieve their goals</li>
<li>making use of incidental opportunities to support children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><p>The leadership of the head teacher has been important in developing a positive team culture and commitment to professional learning. The team is well positioned to now strengthen its focus on the quality of teaching and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and teachers agree the key next steps for the kindergarten&rsquo;s development are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen self review to better enable teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of changes they have made, and the impact the change has had on children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>develop a shared understanding of effective teaching practices and ensure that these practices are consistently implemented</li>
<li>more clearly identify and analyse children&rsquo;s learning and interests, and use this information to plan for ways to extend learning</li>
<li>make the programme more visible in the environment to better communicate children&rsquo;s interests and learning to parents.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Thames completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>14 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
