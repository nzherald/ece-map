</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>YMCA Early Learning Centre is located in Hamilton Central and caters for children from birth to school age. It is licensed to provide full-day education and care for 50 children including up to 16 children under two years old. There are two separate, age-based areas for infants and toddlers and older children. Currently there are 30 children enrolled including five identified as Māori.</p><p>The centre is one of five early childhood centres operating under the umbrella of the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA). Effective governance, leadership and management support is provided by experienced personnel from the YMCA organisation. This support includes regular professional development, appropriate policies, useful strategic planning and self-review frameworks. The recently reviewed centre philosophy expresses the aim to know the whole child in body, mind and spirit, and incorporates the YMCA values of '<em>Honesty, Caring, Respect and Responsibility'</em>.</p><p>Since the ERO review of 2012 the Ministry of Education (MoE) placed the centre on a provisional license and the centre worked successfully to achieve a full licence under the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008 in May 2014. An experienced general manager took up her position in 2013, and a well-qualified centre manager was also appointed. There have been a number of changes to leadership and staffing within the centre. Over 50% of the staff are qualified and the remainder are currently in training.</p><p>The centre has made positive progress in response to the areas for development identified in the ERO report of 2012 related to improving assessment, planning, interactions with children and the environment. During 2014:</p><ul>
<li>the Ministry of Education (MoE) funded a facilitator who implemented extensive and ongoing, whole-staff professional development to strengthen teacher’s understanding of assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>YMCA management took a planned approach to implementing significant and ongoing upgrades to the indoor and outdoor environments</li>
<li>centre leaders strengthened performance management systems and processes including providing regular and specific feedback to teachers about their practice.</li>
</ul><p>Centre management is focused on continued improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers have established trusting and positive relationships with children, parents and whānau. Parents have many opportunities to communicate and contribute to children’s learning. ERO observed teaching practices that were highly respectful and responsive to children’s care and learning. However this practice is not consistently evident across all teachers, both permanent and relieving.</p><p>Babies and toddlers explore the spacious environment and experiment with an appropriate range of good quality equipment and materials. They make choices and experience challenge alongside interested adults. Transitions for these children are well planned and contribute to a settled environment and a strong sense of belonging for children and their families.</p><p>Teachers and children enjoy reading stories, sharing songs, waiata and learning finger plays together. This is promoting early language and communication skills and a love of learning. Routines are flexible, respond to children’s care needs and promote sustained play.</p><p>The programme for older children is a mixture of teacher-led and child-initiated experiences. Teachers make good use of computer technology to extend children’s learning. A four year old transition to school programme is structured to teach children early concepts of literacy and mathematics as well as build their independence. Trips and excursions enrich children’s understanding of the wider community and provide interest for ongoing learning in the centre. Children are able to pursue their interests for sustained periods. Teachers are welcoming of children and families from diverse cultures. Children with special needs are well supported. Positive relationships have been established with the local community, schools and specialist agencies.</p><p>Teachers record children’s involvement in the programme in well-presented individual portfolios. These portfolios are readily available for children to share and revisit their successes and experiences with families and teachers. Teachers should continue to review the portfolios to ensure they acknowledge the individual language, culture and identity of each child, include the child’s voice, and show how the aspirations of parents are regularly sought and enacted.</p><p>Self review systems and processes have recently been improved. Reviews have resulted in significant upgrades to the environment, enhanced performance management systems and a shared understanding and agreement by teachers of the centre philosophy. It is now important to provide opportunities for families and children to share in the process of reviewing the philosophy.</p><p>The general manager provides valued support through regular and ongoing visits to the centre. She and the centre manager work in a respectful and professional partnership that is focused on positive outcomes for children and their families. This partnership is contributing to a clear vision and optimistic sense of direction for centre development and improvement. The centre manager is well respected by teachers and is a model of good practice. She fosters emergent leadership amongst teachers and is providing appropriate support and mentoring for a number of provisionally registered teachers. The centre manager is a strong advocate and works to meet the diverse needs of children and families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Programme development: Teachers have made progress in developing and implementing a process for planning, assessment and evaluation of children’s learning, and sharing this with parents and whānau. Centre leaders and ERO agree there is a need to review:</p><ul>
<li>professional development initiatives to strengthen teachers’ understanding of adding complexity to the programme, improving interactions and enriching the environment in order to engage and extend children’s learning</li>
<li>the impact of teacher-led routines and programmes on children’s ability to manage and sustain their learning</li>
<li>documented expectations for teaching practices that reflect and enact the centre philosophy</li>
<li>teachers’ knowledge and understanding of culturally responsive strategies that promote success for Māori children as Māori.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>Centre leaders and teachers continue to access support from the MoE to strengthen self review to improve teaching practice and programme development.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of YMCA Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice the service provider and centre manager should ensure that regular maintenance and hazard checks are consistently effective, so any concerns can be identified and eliminated or minimised.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of YMCA Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>20 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
