</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Neemo Childcare Centre, located in Hillcrest, Auckland, is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 58 children, 18 of whom can be up to two years of age. The purpose-built centre, opened in 2016, is managed by an owner. This is the centre's first ERO report.</p><p>Children and their teachers are culturally diverse. The children are catered for in three agerelated groups. Babies transition to the toddlers group at approximately two years of age, and toddlers transition to the preschool group when they are four years of age.</p><p>The centre philosophy is based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and influenced by the Reggio Emilia approach to early learning. The philosophy recognises the individuality of children, and the responsibility of teachers to observe children and respond to them in ways that extend their learning. The teachers' role is to facilitate learning led by the child. Staff embrace New Zealand's bicultural heritage and the cultures of all children.</p><p>The centre maintains a high ratio of qualified teachers to children. Team leaders and experienced mentors support teachers in their professional learning and development. A chef provides meals for the children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy respectful interactions with their teachers and each other. They make choices about their play and have easy access to suitable resources in a well-designed environment. Children know the routines of the centre and demonstrate a sense of belonging. They move between the indoor and outdoor areas for much of the day.</p><p>Teachers work with children to support their interests and extend their learning through conversations. They support children's emotional wellbeing. Teachers have introduced the project learning approach to promote children's dispositions to explore and discover.</p><p>High quality education and care for infants and toddlers is evident. Where possible, home routines are continued at the centre. Teachers have a clear focus on supporting children's language development and early literacy. They engage often with the babies and encourage them to respond. The environment is conducive to supporting children to explore and to access resources that promote learning.</p><p>The thoughtful design of the learning environments promotes good communication and transition within the centre. Teachers sensitively manage these transitions giving children and their families time and support to make the changes. Visits between the centre and the local school assist children to prepare for the next stage of their education.</p><p>Teachers work successfully with parents. They encourage parents to share their goals and aspirations for their children. Parents report that staff provide advice and support regarding parenting and child development. Regular formal and informal conversations with parents complement the assessment and planning information about their child's development.</p><p>Teachers are committed to providing high quality assessment. Their planning documents show children's learning over time and support the provision of appropriate learning opportunities. Teachers record what they notice about children's play, the learning that is taking place and how they might support children's learning. Some of these learning stories make useful links to children's previous learning.</p><p>Teachers' observations inform planning for groups and individuals. Teachers write informative learning stories that identify what children are doing and learning. These stories help teachers to extend children's learning.</p><p>The centre's commitment to New Zealand's bicultural heritage is evident in the programme and the environment. Some te reo and tikanga Māori is included during the day. The manager acknowledges that further work can be done in this area.</p><p>There is good support for children's diverse cultures and identities and In some cases teachers are able to use children's home languages when communicating with them and their families.</p><p>Management systems are well designed. Policies and procedures are informed by regulations and best practice guidelines. Personnel management systems support staff to reflect on and improve their professional practice. Teachers regularly participate in professional learning and development. Appropriate appraisal systems are in place.</p><p>Strategic planning and internal evaluation could be strengthened. Clearly identified strategic goals and greater use of evaluative questions would better enable managers to guide and monitor ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager agrees that centre operations would benefit from strengthening:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment of programme planning and children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strategic planning, by setting clear goals and indicators of success and using these to report on progress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation, by using specific evaluative questions to guide the review of centre operations.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Neemo Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Neemo Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>18 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
