</table><p>Biggles Childcare is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Biggles Childcare is a privately owned centre that operates in two adapted residential buildings; the Cub House for infants and toddlers, and the Bear House for older children. The Bear House has a large outdoor area. The centre is licensed for 40 children, including 12 children under the age of two years. Approximately 25 percent of children have Māori or Pacific heritage.</p><p>New owners purchased the centre in October 2018. One of the owners manages the daily operations of the centre. He is focused on continuing to work in partnership with parents and whānau, building teacher expertise and providing a positive learning environment.</p><p>The centre's current philosophy emphasises relationships, children's social competency, and values the multicultural diversity of the community. Teachers, managers, parents and whānau are in the process of reviewing the philosophy.</p><p>ERO's 2015 review identified the need to redevelop the outdoor environment for infants and toddlers. There is still some work needed to develop a high quality area for this age group. The centre responded well to prioritising the development and implementation of a teacher appraisal system aligned to Education Council requirements. Improving planning and assessment systems, and establishing clear responsibilities for managers and leaders, continue to be priorities for the new owner and centre staff.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident learners. They settle quickly on arrival and are warmly welcomed by teachers. They lead the direction of their play and move freely between indoor and outdoor areas. Children play well together and have good relationships with each other. They experience trusting and respectful relationships with staff. Children have a strong sense of belonging, and their culture and identity is celebrated.</p><p>Infants and toddlers experience good quality care. They have kind and caring relationships with teachers. Teachers work closely with families to ensure that home routines are followed. They are increasingly communicating with parents and whānau about their children's learning and development.</p><p>The programme responds effectively to children's interests. Teachers recognise the importance of children learning through play. They plan collaboratively and have regular professional discussions about children's learning and wellbeing. Teachers know children well and work positively with parents and whānau to support children's learning.</p><p>Teachers continue to strengthen planning and assessment practices. This is impacting positively on the quality of the programmes provided for children. Centre leaders are committed to building their leadership capacity and capability. Teachers increasingly have opportunities to participate in professional learning and development that promotes positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers' commitment to New Zealand's bicultural heritage is evident. Children respond positively to the use of te reo Māori and tikanga practices in the centre. The learning environment is enhanced through teachers' use of natural materials.</p><p>Policies and procedures have been established and continue to be developed. Internal evaluation for future improvement is focused on achieving positive outcomes for children. The new owners are managing a time of significant change and transition for the centre. Strategic and annual plans that outline areas for further development and ongoing improvement have been developed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner, centre leaders and ERO agree the key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening curriculum planning and assessment systems to focus on children's individual learning dispositions, interests and strengths</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the centre philosophy, programme and teacher practice to align more closely with <em>Te Whāriki 2017</em>, the early childhood curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing clear roles and responsibilities for the management, leadership and teaching teams.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Biggles Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>18 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
