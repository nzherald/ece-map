</table><p>Pukeko Preschool Pakuranga Heights is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pukeko Preschool Pakuranga Heights is one of four privately owned centres providing education and care for local communities. This service provides both sessional and full-day options for up to 40 children, including a maximum of 10 aged under two years. Staff and children reflect the diverse local community. The roll includes small groups of Māori children and those with Pacific heritage. The majority of teachers are qualified.</p><p>The owners have developed vision, mission and philosophy statements in collaboration with all staff across the organisation and with whānau. These statements guide teachers' thinking about responsibilities and expectations for teaching practices, and inform whānau about centres' teaching and learning values. The centre is led by a manager, under the guidance of the owners, who provide ongoing support and guidance, and operational frameworks for teachers.</p><p>Children are grouped according to age. Younger children spend most of the day in their own indoor and outdoor spaces. Older children have spacious environments, including a large enclosed deck for play. Teachers include some aspects of Reggio Emilia philosophical approaches in their presentation of the environment.</p><p>ERO's 2015 report noted good practices that have been sustained. It also identified areas for development, including self review, the alignment of guiding documents, and planning to support extended learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the centre. Children make choices about their play and settle quickly. Whānau and caregivers who spoke to ERO generally think highly of the care and education their children receive. They have good opportunities to share their aspirations and expectations for their children's learning.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are settled and have prolonged opportunities to explore their learning spaces. Teachers provide a selection of appropriate resources to extend children's play. They interact consistently with children as they play, and comfort those still settling.</p><p>Older children are highly engaged in their play. They work together and actively explore a wide range of activities and experiences, both indoors and outdoors. The environment is accessible and attracts children's interest. Teachers engage children in conversations and support their ideas, to extend their play. This also helps to extend children's language capability.</p><p>Teachers support children's basic understanding of te reo and tikanga Māori. Children are learning about the value teachers place on their cultural identity and languages. Many wall displays highlight children's cultural backgrounds and languages. Some teachers are able to talk to children and their whānau in their home languages. This helps both whānau and children to settle in the centre.</p><p>Teachers use a framework provided by managers to guide internal evaluation. This has contributed to their knowledge and understanding about <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the revised early childhood curriculum. Teachers are linking this understanding to their assessment and planning processes, using their knowledge about children as a starting point. Teachers could now strengthen their evaluation of the curriculum to determine the impact of their practices on learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Management of the service is efficient. Policies and procedures are regularly reviewed. Strategic and annual plans are linked, and have a focus on positive outcomes for children. As key next steps, the owners' leadership should support changes to teaching and learning, appraisal, and internal evaluation processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owners and teachers should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>deepen internal evaluation, including teachers' reflections, to increase their knowledge of how well teaching is supporting children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve the teacher appraisal process by linking observations of teaching to the goals each teacher has set</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a centre-specific philosophy that references the overarching Pukeko group philosophy, and includes this centre's aims and ambitions for its community.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pukeko Preschool Pakuranga Heights completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>24 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
