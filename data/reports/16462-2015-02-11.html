</table><p>Dargaville Playcentre needs support to improve programmes for children, develop sustainable effective self review processes and to strengthen leadership capacity.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Dargaville Playcentre is a parent cooperative providing one session per week for children up to school age. The centre is licensed for 30 children, including 15 children up to the age of two years. Children enrolled come from Dargaville town and its surrounding areas. The centre’s roll fluctuates considerably and members struggle to maintain the roll to full licence capacity.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of Northland Playcentre Association (NPA). The Association provides administration and policy frameworks to guide and support centre members. The Playcentre philosophy of parents and children learning together underpins centre operations.</p><p>The Association’s support worker is new to this leadership role. A longstanding, experienced member supports and guides newer members, most of who are participating in Playcentre’s parent education programme.</p><p>The centre has a history of positive ERO reports. Members are committed to the Playcentre philosophy as it promotes social opportunities for children and families. The areas for review and development identified in ERO’s 2010 report continue to be a focus for centre members.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and happy. They are involved in the activities that members provide. Children have a sense of security, with their parents being the key people in their play and learning. Parents are attentive and focus on their children’s play. They could consider ways to allow children to play more independently and work on activities that encourage their own creativity.</p><p>The learning environment is well established and indoor and outdoor play equipment is accessible for children. The large outdoor playground is well used and popular with children. Members could promote literacy, mathematics and science more in this play space.</p><p>Members relate respectfully and responsively with children. They encourage children in their play and conversations. All adults contribute positively to supervising all children. Parents see the centre as a place for children to develop their social skills, build good friendships and play and learn alongside their children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members agree that next steps to improve the outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>developing a systematic approach to planning and assessing children’s learning over time</li>
<li>completing training course levels to meet centre goals</li>
<li>developing self review processes to evaluate how well they are supporting children to learn</li>
<li>establishing strategic and annual plans, and formally documenting key actions to achieve the centre’s desired outcomes</li>
<li>promoting mathematics and literacy more often in the context of children’s play.</li>
</ul><p>More focused support from the Association or external providers will be important to help centre members continue to develop the skills needed to provide high quality programmes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Dargaville Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to the quality of the curriculum, shared leadership and effective self review. To meet requirements the centre must:</p><ul>
<li>plan programmes that are more clearly responsive to children’s individual interests and strengths</li>
<li>establish more formal and regular self-review practices to support ongoing improvement and more sustainable good practice.</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C2; GMA, 6.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the centre, in consultation with the Association and the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Dargaville Playcentre will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern Select Region</p><p>11 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
