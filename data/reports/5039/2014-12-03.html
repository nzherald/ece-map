</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Cascades Kindergarten, in Pakuranga, Auckland, provides education and care for up to forty children over two years old. The kindergarten operates sessions whose hours match those of schools. Some children attend for mornings only.</p><p>Cascades Kindergarten is an established service that reflects the diverse cultural mix of its local community. The kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA) and operates within the policies and framework of this organisation. A professional services manager (PSM) visits and provides management and curriculum support for teachers. The AKA has high expectations that teachers will provide a bicultural programme.</p><p>All teachers regularly participate in professional development. This learning enhances their practice and develops shared understandings about children’s learning and social development. The kindergarten has received a Bronze Enviroschool 'reflection' and this strength is evident in the centre environment.</p><p>In 2011 ERO identified many positive features of the service. At that time teachers identified the need to involve children more in their own planning, strengthen self review, and increase whānau participation in the programme. Teachers have responded effectively to these challenges, establishing and sustaining good practices. The kindergarten philosophy is clearly reflected in centre practices for the benefit of children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Cascades Kindergarten is characterised by high quality relationships. Children are acknowledged as capable and competent learners. This affirmation is reflected in the learning programme, the kindergarten environment, and the respectful interactions between adults and children. Parents are welcomed and supported in the kindergarten community. They report that they feel valued as partners in their children’s education and supported by teachers to participate fully in all aspects of the programme.</p><p>Teachers have high expectations of children and work to ensure learning programmes meet the strengths and interests of all learners. Children benefit from teachers who are responsive to their physical, social and emotional needs. Children are supported and expected to become independent learners. They have opportunities for problem solving and challenge. Programmes provide very good opportunities for children to:</p><ul>
<li>extend their thinking</li>
<li>develop new skills</li>
<li>take risks in a safe environment</li>
<li>extend their physical and emotional capacity</li>
<li>experience success in new learning situations.</li>
</ul><p>Children participate readily in prolonged periods of uninterrupted play and are relaxed in the way they move to new tasks and activities. They are resilient when facing obstacles.</p><p>The programme is well designed and implemented. Early literacy and mathematical concepts are integrated into the daily programme and provide children with appropriate challenge. Teachers’ language is rich and used well to expand children’s oral language. Children enjoy extensive, meaningful conversations with teachers and each other. The kindergarten’s literacy environment reflects the languages and voices of the children who attend.</p><p>The kindergarten has a strong curriculum in te ao Māori. Teachers make extended use of te reo throughout the programme. Children progress well beyond the early stages of Māori language acquisition. This learning supports their cultural understanding and language development. Parents and teachers indicate that children actively seek to increase their knowledge of te reo Māori and involve their families in this process.</p><p>Children with special needs are well supported to experience rich, meaningful learning. Children are observed and their progress reviewed to identify their next steps. The kindergarten provides an effective programme for children learning to speak English (ESOL). The programme is led by a teacher with expertise who ensures children make continuing improvements in their understanding and speaking of English.</p><p>Teachers are committed to delivering high quality education that meets the needs of individual children. They have a good knowledge and understanding of learners and their families. Teachers regularly consult and communicate with parents. They seek their contributions in planning programmes and working with their children. Teachers use this information to make a positive difference for children.</p><p>The head teacher capably leads a professionally focused team. Strong links are evident between the kindergarten’s annual plan and AKA’s strategic goals. Teachers’ participation in robust appraisal, professional learning and action research is evident in their highly reflective self review and ongoing practice. They ensure decisions they make are relevant, meaningful, and in the best interests of children.</p><p>The Auckland Kindergarten Association continues to provide strong governance for kindergartens. Positive strategies include effective professional learning and development that is responsive to strengthening teachers’ professional skills, knowledge and practice. Distributed leadership among kindergarten teaching teams is also promoted and the sharing of knowledge and expertise within the Association is encouraged. Association leaders are currently reviewing the appraisal process and continue to explore appropriate ways to support teachers and ensure high quality outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teachers, the PSM and ERO agree that the key next steps for the kindergarten should include continuing to develop children’s learning portfolios to ensure they reflect the high quality of the kindergarten’s learning programme.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Cascades Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Cascades Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>3 December 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> ERO’s <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
