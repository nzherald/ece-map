</table><p>Barnardos Early Learning Centre, Te Puna Oraka is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Puna Oraka Early Learning Centre is a new centre. This is its first ERO review. It is owned and administered by Barnardos New Zealand. The centre provides education and care for children from birth to school age. The nursery and preschool each have their own spacious indoor and outdoor areas. The learning areas are well resourced.</p><p>The centre has stable staffing. Nearly all staff members are qualified and registered early childhood teachers or teachers in training.</p><p>The Te Puna Oraka Community Early Years Service (Hub) and the centre share the same site. A special feature of the centre is the integrated services and support that Barnardos and the Hub provide for families.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are nurtured and respected by teachers. They are warmly welcomed and helped to quickly settle into the programme.</p><p>Children’s learning and wellbeing are actively promoted. Teachers encourage children’s leadership and work alongside them. They use a range of successful approaches to help children to share their ideas and to develop them further. They carefully listen to children, ask searching questions and join in creative play.</p><p>Infants and toddlers in the nursery have sensitive and responsive relationships with their teacher. She skilfully responds to the individual personalities, routines and needs of each child. She makes routines fun and involves children in decision making. Infants and toddlers appeared happy and confident.</p><p>Managers and teachers have established strong partnerships with their families and the wider community. They use a range of effective approaches to make sure that families are involved in decision making for the centre and their child’s learning and development. The head teacher makes good use of her own cultural background to involve and support the centre’s Pasifika community.</p><p>Families are well supported when their children transition within the centre and to school. Teachers provide a useful range of information to help families support their children prepare for school and to make decisions for enrolling at school.</p><p>Managers and teachers are making good progress in establishing effective ways to plan for and evaluate children’s learning. Nursery planning shows clear links between children’s interests, outcomes for learning and the ways that teachers will promote these outcomes. Ways to include Māori values and culture are also well integrated into the nursery planning.</p><p>The centre head teacher and teachers are well supported by Barnardos managers and leaders. There is a strong focus on developing leadership and providing professional development to increase the capability and capacity of all staff. The managers provide regular, robust feedback on how well the centre is meeting its philosophy, vision and goals for learning and teaching, and supporting families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers, leaders and ERO agree that the next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen self-review practices</li>
<li>plan and evaluate the programme more consistently in the area for older children</li>
<li>continue to improve the consistency of best assessment practice in all learning stories</li>
<li>extend the way Māori language and culture are integrated into all aspects of the centre.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Barnardos Early Learning Centre, Te Puna Oraka completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Barnardos Early Learning Centre, Te Puna Oraka will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
