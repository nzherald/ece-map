</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Early Childhood on Stafford is a privately owned and operated education and care centre. It is centrally located in Dunedin city, close to local schools and other community facilities.</p><p>The centre provides an all-day programme for up to 50 children aged from birth to five years. Children attend the centre for a minimum of 30 hours a week. Infants and toddlers are in a separate room to the over-two year olds.</p><p>The centre has twelve teachers, several of whom are males. One teacher is about to undertake training in early childhood education. All others are qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>Teachers aim for children to be confident and competent learners. They have revisited the centre philosophy. It reflects their commitment to promote enjoyment, fun and creativity for children while at the centre. They all share responsibility for all children’s learning and care.</p><p>Centre managers are highly involved with children in the daily programme. They model their expectations for best practice for children’s learning, care and support. The centre has made good progress towards meeting the recommendations identified in the 2011 ERO report. Managers have identified the need to further develop strategic planning and aspects of self review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from a wide range of interesting and enjoyable experiences, events and activities in and out of the centre. Children receive a rich integration of the arts, technology, mathematics and literacy, science, Māori culture and social skill development during their time at the centre. These are built from the diverse strengths and interests of their teachers and the freedom each teacher has to develop the programme.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy is evident in action, in the way that:</p><ul>
<li>children are encouraged to be creative, to self manage and pursue their interests</li>
<li>teachers’ focus is to build children’s confidence, develop their practical skills, and connect them with their home and the wider world</li>
<li>a rich and diverse view of children’s learning is held and planned for by all teachers</li>
<li>all teachers interact positively and respectfully with all children.</li>
</ul><p>A positive feature is the strong relationships evident between the teachers, children and parents.</p><ul>
<li>They all get to know each other well, sharing trust, warmth and humour.</li>
<li>Teachers and children in the under and over two areas enjoy each others’ company.</li>
<li>Parents are warmly greeted and made to feel at ease and welcome to join in.</li>
<li>Teachers work collegially, sharing ideas for making life at the centre fun for children.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers make good use of the varied, natural outdoor environment. Children have:</p><ul>
<li>purposeful, activities that mirror work at home and in their wider world</li>
<li>stimulating areas that promote learning and creative play</li>
<li>safe opportunities for developing their physical confidence</li>
<li>authentic experiences to develop a respect for, use of, and learning about the natural environment.</li>
</ul><p>ICT is well used by children, teachers and managers at the centre. The on-line communication and sharing of children’s experiences at the centre has increased parent access and input to children’s learning.</p><p>The centre has developed detailed expectations for what five year old leavers can competently achieve. The criteria have been developed by leaders, teachers and parents. They are effectively used to set formal goals for four year old children’s learning until they leave the centre. Teachers and parents make ongoing contributions to this record over the year. Although it is in its early stage of use, parents view this positively.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders have identified, and ERO agrees, that there is a need to:</p><ul>
<li>develop key goals for long-term strategic planning and action plans for how they will be implemented</li>
<li>link key goals to teacher appraisal goals, where appropriate</li>
<li>build a shared understanding of what the graduate profile criteria look like in practice.</li>
</ul><p>Following discussion with ERO, leaders intend to explore how their systems for evaluating the quality of children’s learning stories can be used to inform self review.</p><p>Leaders and teachers could now also consider to what extent:</p><ul>
<li>key documents include Māori dimensions, such as the philosophy and graduate profile</li>
<li>learning stories make clear what teachers have done to support the previously identified next steps in learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Early Childhood on Stafford completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>The centre managers need to ensure the timely police vetting of non-teaching staff. (Education Act 1989).</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Early Childhood on Stafford will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
