</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres Milford is one of two adjacent centres that serve local North Shore families. The centre provides full day education and care for children up to three years of age. It is organised into three rooms to cater for the different age groups. Children have ready access to separate outdoor areas and opportunities to play with mixed ages throughout the day. Most children transition to the nearby centre that caters for children over two years of age.</p><p>The service is part of the Kindercare umbrella organisation that provides administrative and professional support. A centre manager supervises and takes responsibility for day-to-day centre operations. Centre leaders work closely together to contribute to curriculum development across the two centres. Since the 2012 ERO review professional learning and development has focused on the teacher’s role in extending children’s learning. The centre benefits from having mostly qualified teachers and low staff turnover.</p><p>Centre leaders have responded positively to improvements suggested in the 2012 ERO report. These areas focused on developing teachers’ understanding about their engagement with Māori learners and their whānau, and giving greater prominence to science in the curriculum. Collaborative self-review processes noted in the 2012 report have helped address these and other areas for development identified by centre management.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres Milford provides high quality education and care for children. Kindercare’s key priority of keeping children 'Save, Loved, and Learning' is evident in the centre’s programme and interactions between people.</p><p>Children are confident communicators and curious learners. They enjoy rich learning opportunities to use their imagination, solve problems and extend their thinking. Teachers provide nurturing care for infants and toddlers and build trusting relationships with them. They skilfully respond to infants’ early attempts at verbalisation and use language to soothe and comfort. Teachers model new words for toddlers and give them time to respond and converse.</p><p>Highly effective leadership contributes to the very good quality education and care for children. Centre leaders use well researched early childhood theory and methodology to focus on what is best for children. They are confident in their role as enablers of learning for teachers and children.</p><p>Teachers have high expectations of themselves in their role of extending children’s learning. They are committed to their professional learning and take a collective responsibility for ongoing centre improvements. Adults learn from each other within an environment of high trust. Centre leaders and teachers actively contribute their ideas and talents to provide children with an innovative curriculum.</p><p>Teacher planning and assessment is highly responsive to individual children’s interests and strengths. Teachers use children’s preferences and ways of learning as a basis for shaping the programme. Children experience literacy, mathematics and the sciences in the context of play. They express their ideas in the knowledge that their teachers will value and build on their contributions.</p><p>Parents have ready access to informative records of their child’s learning over time. Teachers use daily journals to engage parents in their children’s learning. Parents have opportunities to contribute to the planning for their child, and the learning is made apparent and clear.</p><p>Māori children’s culture and identity are well catered for. Teachers reinforce the bicultural principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, by taking time to get to know Māori children and their whānau. Te ao Māori is integrated into daily centre practice. Māori children hear and see their language and culture in the programme. Centre leaders have appropriately identified that to sustain these very good practices, biculturalism could be more visible and celebrated in key centre documents.</p><p>Centre staff acknowledge Pacific children’s different island heritages. They share their understanding of the culture and language of different Pacific nations. As a result, Pacific children benefit from programmes that reflect and recognise their own culture.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers have a very good shared understanding of self review. They use it well to promote positive outcomes for children. High quality evaluative practice is evident in the way they consider implications for their teaching and leadership roles.</p><p>Governance and management of the centre is efficient and effective. Operational systems and processes are well aligned. ERO is confident that the centre has the capability, through its high quality leadership and effective long-term planning and review, to sustain its successful development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre’s very good self-review processes could be used to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>opportunities for more child and parent voice in self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres (Milford) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres (Milford) will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>27 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
