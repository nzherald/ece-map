</table><p>City Heights Montessori is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>City Heights Montessori is one of two privately-owned early childhood services operating on the same site, close to Dunedin city centre. Since 2016 a third licence providing education and care for infants has been combined with the toddler programme under this licence. This service now provides education and care for up to 49 children up to the age of three. A head teacher works within the classroom and has responsibility for the daily programme.</p><p>The centre is led by a professional leader working with a newly-formed leadership team. The team includes the head teachers and a manager.</p><p>Recommendations in the 2016 ERO report included clarifying the centre's priorities for children's learning, improving assessment, planning and evaluation, clarifying leadership roles and responsibilities and strengthening internal evaluation.</p><p>Since then, the professional leader has strengthened the alignment of the service's practices with the Montessori philosophy. New members of staff have settled into their roles and the leadership team-work together to share responsibility for the service's operation. Assessment practices and internal evaluation processes have also improved.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Infants and toddlers show a sense of belonging. This is evident in the ways they lead the direction of their learning, settle quickly and engage with the daily programme. They are familiar with the daily routines and the teachers' expectations for their learning and behaviour. They are well cared for by teachers who are responsive to their interests, needs and preferences. Teachers develop trusting relationships with children and responsive to their verbal and non-verbal cues.</p><p>Infants and toddlers have easy access to a range of activities and good quality resources and equipment, all of which have a clear learning purpose. They play and learn in calm, settled environments. Teachers support infants and toddlers as they grow in independence and learn to self-regulate. They integrate literacy and numeracy learning well within the daily programme.</p><p>Children's progress overtime across the curriculum and Montessori learning objectives is closely monitored and evident in learning records. Assessments illustrate and support continuity in learning and show children's progress in a range of contexts and in relation to the service's valued learning outcomes.</p><p>The service values New Zealand's bicultural heritage. Teachers are working to improve their te reo Māori. A planned approach is needed to build the confidence and ability of all teachers to support children's learning in te reo Māori and to make Māori perspectives and the enactment of the Treaty of Waitangi principles more visible within programmes and practices. The next step for teachers is to show more clearly and consistently how they affirm, support and celebrate the language, culture and identity of children and their families in the programme and in documentation.</p><p>The centre's development is guided by useful strategic and annual plans. Leaders have high expectations for children’s learning and are making good progress embedding programmes and practices in line with these. The philosophy and vision have been revised to support the service's aspirations and priorities for children's learning. These priorities for children's learning could be further simplified. This may help teachers and leaders to more effectively evaluate how well the programmes and practices are supporting the desired outcomes for children.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have used internal evaluation processes well to make improvements in practice leading to positive outcomes for children. Leaders and teachers are beginning to make use of quality indicators to inform their judgements. They could further develop the review schedule to ensure that the key aspects of the service's operation that most impact on children, are reviewed regularly over time.</p><p>The leadership team work closely to manage the service's systems and to determine roles and responsibilities in line with newly developed job descriptions. It is time to review systems and processes to ensure regular checking of consistency of practice in relation to compliance requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the professional leader and leadership team agree that the next steps for improving centre practice include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a planned approach to building the ways teachers affirm, support and celebrate Maori culture and the language, culture and identity of all children and their families and make this more visible in programmes and practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to build internal evaluation processes and practice's including the development of a schedule to ensure the regular review of key aspects of the operation over time, including priorities for children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of City Heights Montessori completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice within the context of health and safety, leaders need to develop more effective processes and monitoring systems to ensure consistent compliance with regulatory requirements.</p><p>In particular, leaders need to implement a robust system for monitoring the consistency of practice when teachers record children's sleep and when teachers complete excursion forms.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>20 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
