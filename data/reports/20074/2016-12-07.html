</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Dudes Childcare is a private, family owned centre, that provides education and care for up to 23 children aged from two to five years. The centre was purchased by the current owner in 2012. The ground floor is used for centre operations and the owner lives upstairs.</p><p>The owner/manager is an experienced early childhood teacher, who employs four registered teachers and a part time cook. The ethnically diverse teaching team works closely with the manager and head teacher in the daily operation of the centre.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy focuses on enhancing children's curiosity and values collaboration and partnerships with families. The philosophy is based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. A recent philosophy review has prioritised the celebration of the increasingly culturally diverse community.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report noted the positive relationships between children and adults, children's confidence to play creatively, and teachers' growing ability to respond to their interests. These positive aspects remain evident. ERO suggested that teachers develop programme planning and performance management systems. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers warmly welcome children and their whānau into an inclusive and caring learning environment. Teachers have good relationships with families. Children settle quickly into the centre, are familiar with the routines and have positive relationships with adults. They are enthusiastic and confidently articulate their choices. Tuakana/teina relationships are evident as older and younger children work together. Children are confident about their learning and are supported to become independent.</p><p>Teachers work as a cohesive team to provide a programme that is responsive to children’s cultural identities. Some children use te reo Māori, and respond to Samoan and other languages used by teachers. The learning environment features the languages and symbols of children’s backgrounds, including the diverse Pacific heritages. Teachers could now include a clearer statement about the centre's commitment to <em>Te Tiriti o Waitangi</em> in their philosophy statement<em>.</em></p><p>Teachers value children’s play as a context for learning and respect their right to express a point of view. The outdoor playground is spacious and teachers could now add more natural materials to inspire children’s sense of adventure, and contribute to a more vibrant learning environment. There is room for more creativity and increased exploration and discovery for children.</p><p>Regular planning meetings allow teachers to discuss their observations of children and to plan ways to extending their learning. Children’s assessment portfolios are available for them to revisit their learning and for parents to contribute information.</p><p>Deepening their knowledge and skills of programme planning, assessment and evaluation, would help managers and teachers to strengthen the curriculum. They could improve records of children’s learning to show children’s progress and continuity of learning over time. External professional development could help teachers develop a curriculum that is more responsive to children's interests.</p><p>Parents/whānau regularly participate in the programme and enjoy daily conversations with teachers. They comment positively about their children’s progress and the programme provided. Parents appreciate the family atmosphere at the centre, and the way teachers care for children. Strengthening partnerships with whānau through genuine consultation is a key next step for teachers.</p><p>Ongoing improvement is a focus for centre leaders. Teachers attend professional development courses and share this knowledge with each other. An appraisal process supports teachers to reflect on their practices. Teachers have reviewed their practices and made changes to improve learning outcomes for children. They could now evaluate the effectiveness of this process and include parent and child perspectives.</p><p>An annual plan clearly identifies the centre’s priorities. It is timely now for the manager to develop a longer term plan, in consultation with teachers and parents, to support progress towards the centre’s strategic goals. Centre policies also need to be updated to include current legal requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To improve professional practice and management systems, managers and teachers should access external professional support to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and monitor strategic and annual planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review the quality of programme planning, assessment and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>strengthen teachers' appraisal processes</li>
<li>review job descriptions to more clearly identify specific roles and responsibilities.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Dudes Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Dudes Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>7 December 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
