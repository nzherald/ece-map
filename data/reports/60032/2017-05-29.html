</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hataitai Playcentre is one of 19 parent-led early childhood centres governed and administered by the Wellington Playcentre Association (the association). It is licensed to provide mixed age sessional education and care for up to 30 children, five mornings a week. This includes provision for 18 children up to the age of two at any one time. </p><p>A council, of elected volunteer representatives from each of the association's member centres, oversees operation of the association at the governance level. Their work is assisted by an operations manager and general manager. An executive committee administers the adult education programme and tutors provide timely guidance and support for members. Responsibility for <br> day-to-day operation is undertaken by centre-elected office holders.</p><p>A centre support worker is employed to visit the centre and provide professional advice and feedback to strengthen practice and promote improvement. The support worker's more formalised role was developed after the 2014 ERO review that identified the need for a more effective response to the needs of individual centres. </p><p>The association philosophy, Whānau tupu ngātahi – families growing together, is articulated as empowering parents and children to learn, grow and play together and underpins practice. This was reaffirmed by the association and Hataitai Playcentre in 2016 and guides service provision and practice for their learning community.</p><p>Hataitai Playcentre has a positive reporting history with ERO and responded proactively to the areas identified for improvement in the 2014 review. The 2014 ERO report identified that centre leaders would benefit from association support to further develop a more bicultural perspective, to refine assessment, planning and to strengthen self-review practices.  In addition the association was to redevelop the appraisal process for centre-based employees. All have been considered and appropriately actioned.</p><p>Curriculum planning and implementation, at Hataitai Playcentre, is a shared responsibility. Each session is supported by a duty team of parent educators or an employee who hold Playcentre training certificates. Most centre members participate in the adult education programme provided by the association.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation, of which the Wellington Association is part, is planning a significant restructure for 2017. Playcentres will become part of a regional hub, supported by a regional manager and support persons.<br> <br> The review was part of a cluster of nine in the Wellington Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s holistic development is enhanced through their engagement in child initiated play-based learning. <em>Te Whāriki</em> and Playcentre philosophy underpin centre practice. Assessment and planning have been significantly improved, with clear guidelines for achieving positive outcomes for children as confident, lifelong learners. Effective systems to collate and communicate observations about children’s developing interests and skills inform planning and assessment. Individual learning portfolios celebrate children's progress, showing their developing skills, knowledge and attributes. <br> <br> The centre support person and duty teams provide effective leadership that contributes positively to children’s early learning experience. Helpful strategies are in place to support newer members to the centre to document and record children's learning and progress.</p><p>The high levels of involvement in the centre's community and a sense of collective responsibility for children, provide a positive platform for learning. Members are a diverse group of enthusiastic parents and whānau who bring valuable skills and knowledge to their roles. Well-developed systems support the day-to- day running of the playcentre.  A four person leadership team ensures all aspects of organisation and operation are well managed. Each leader has responsibility to provide specific guidance for the smooth running of the centre.  This deliberate practice supports succession planning.</p><p>The centre’s bicultural journey has been intentionally planned to support all adults and children. A comprehensive internal evaluation was undertaken, during 2014, to discover how well the association expected to see te reo me ngā tikanga Māori as part of a culturally rich, responsive curriculum. In 2016, Hataitai Playcentre began a review of how successfully members engage with <br> te ao Māori and the impact on children. Success for children who identify as Māori is part of the review. ERO's evaluation affirms this process.</p><p>The dual purpose of self review for accountability and improvement is well understood and guides ongoing decision-making. Planning priorities are aligned to the service and association vision and positioned to improving teaching and learning.  Self-review practices have had a positive impact on children’s social development and learning. In 2015, a review of how well members support the sense of belonging and wellbeing of tamariki in relation to kai led to changes in routines. Leaders are aware of the importance of revisiting the impact of any review so that all members know the purpose and outcomes from the process.</p><p>Well-considered transition processes for children and parents new to the centre enable them to become part of the learning community. Parents are mentored by more experienced members who model an open collaborative approach. Well-chosen age-appropriate equipment and effective session planning enables and supports children of all ages to play and learn together. The centre is highly responsive and provides well for up to two year olds and for all children. Thoughtful improvements to the inside and outside environments provide support, challenge and fun in the programme.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Association and centre leaders should continue to improve outcomes for children and families by using internal evaluation effectively to ensure the good practice occurring is sustained and prioritised developments are achieved.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hataitai Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hataitai Playcentre will be in four years.</p><p>Patricia Davey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>4 May 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
