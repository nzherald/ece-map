</table><p>Lollipops Te Rapa requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Te Rapa is a privately-owned service, licensed to provide education and care for 50 children, including 25 up to two years of age. At the time of this review there were 40 children enrolled, including 16 who identify as Māori. Many other ethnicities are also represented. The two learning spaces provide for the needs of infants, toddlers and young children.</p><p>The service is governed by the Evolve Education Group. A manager is responsible for quality assurance and professional learning and an area manager provides support to the centre manager and teaching team. A new centre manager was appointed in March 2019. There have been a significant number of staff changes, including the appointment of a new head teacher.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy has been developed in collaboration with the new team and is based on relationships, the celebration of the uniqueness of many cultures, aroha, kindness and respect. These values support tamariki to become confident and competent learners.</p><p>There has been some progress towards the recommendations from the June 2016 ERO report. However, adding complexity to children's learning and providing a wider range of high quality equipment and activities remain priorities for further development. Significant changes at the governance and management level and at the centre have impacted on the rate of progress in responding to these priorities.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive and affirming relationships between teachers, children and their families are strongly evident in the centre. There are respectful interactions between children and teachers and encouraging the development of social and emotional competence is a focus in the centre. Children are supported to follow their interests. Teachers are responsive to the needs of children with additional needs. Te reo Māori me ngā tikanga practices are integral to the daily life of the centre and support a sense of belonging for Māori children. Transitions within the centre are personalised and flexible. Teachers are beginning to establish successful relationships with local schools to support transition to school.</p><p>Children up to the age of two experience responsive caregiving that supports their need for strong and secure attachment. The environment is calm and unhurried. There is regular and effective communication between parents and teachers about the needs of very young children.</p><p>Programmes and daily routines successfully reflect the centre's bicultural and multi-cultural community. Teachers actively seek ways to maintain children’s connections to their cultural identity. Māori concepts such as manaakitanga and whanaungatanga influence curriculum decision-making. A wide range of curriculum opportunities are in place and include community input. Individualised digital planning and assessment process enables collaborative planning. Continued implementation and further refinement of this process is needed to build teachers' knowledge and use of the learning outcomes in <em>Te Whāriki</em> (2017)<em>,</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The new centre manager is providing clear direction for staff at the centre. The collaboratively developed vision and philosophy is underpinned by a strong commitment to bicultural practice. Reflective, approachable and responsive leadership has developed a culture of relational trust and a sense of team amongst staff. There are high expectations for teacher practice to support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Many systems and processes are newly implemented and now need time to become embedded. Internal evaluation is leading to improvements in teaching and learning practices. Performance management processes are being implemented. Relevant professional learning and development is supporting teacher practice. When fully implemented the new appraisal system should encourage teachers to inquire into the effectiveness of their own teaching practice.</p><p>Evolve Education Group has restructured and is currently in a period of significant redevelopment. In 2018, there was restructuring of governance and management roles and responsibilities. A new chief executive officer has recently been appointed. The teaching and learning development and area managers who support Lollipops Te Rapa are new to their roles in 2019. Systems and processes are being updated as areas of need are identified by regional managers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre staff should continue to respond to the many changes in systems and processes by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implementing the new appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening teacher knowledge and use of <em>Te Whāriki</em> (2017)<em>,</em> the early childhood curriculum, to inform assessment, planning and evaluation and in particular extending and deepening the learning opportunities for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effectively monitoring the newly developed centre systems and processes to ensure sustainability.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Te Rapa completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to premises and facilities. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a sufficient quantity and variety of (indoor and outdoor) furniture, equipment and materials is provided that is appropriate for the learning and abilities of the children attending</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that the outdoor activity space is safe well-drained and suitably surfaced for a variety of activities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, PF4, PF13]</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>19 December 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p><div type="FOOTER">
