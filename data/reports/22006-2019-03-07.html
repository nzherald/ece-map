</table><p>Henderson Valley Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Henderson Valley Playcentre operates as a parent cooperative and is licensed for 30 children, including 20 up to the age of two years. Since the 2015 ERO review, the roll has increased and become more culturally diverse.</p><p>Programmes for children are underpinned by the Playcentre philosophy of parents and children playing and learning together. The vision of Henderson Valley Playcentre members is to emphasise the importance of learning through play and recognise parents as first teachers of their tamariki. Centre members support children's interests, a bicultural perspective, and the home languages of families for whom English is an additional language.</p><p>The centre offers three-hour, parent-led play sessions four days a week. It hosts a supervised weekly session for children aged three years and older, and a session for children aged under two.</p><p>The centre is part of the newly established Northern North Island Playcentre Region. Regional systems support centre members to manage their centres and to provide educational programmes for their children. Playcentre personnel also provide adult education programmes for parents/whānau to achieve Playcentre qualifications.</p><p>ERO’s 2015 report recommended further development of bicultural practices and adults' professional knowledge. It also recommended that self review and strategic planning be strengthened. Centre members have responded positively to those recommendations.</p><p>This review is part of a cluster of 12 reviews in the North Island Playcentre Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children lead the programme, choosing from a wide range of accessible learning resources. They readily settle and involve themselves in play. Children relate confidently and talk well with adults. They benefit from high levels of engagement in play and a good focus on wellbeing. The centre culture is inclusive of diverse cultures and learners. Children have a strong sense of belonging and enjoy their friendships in a homely and stimulating learning environment.</p><p>Parents/whānau appreciate and immerse themselves in the Playcentre philosophy of learning through play. Interactions with children are positive and challenging, and provoke active engagement in the joy of learning.</p><p>Adults are adept at extending children's conversations and providing opportunities for them to sustain play and develop creativity and imagination. There are good opportunities to promote oral language, social interaction and emotional competence. Te reo, waiata and tikanga Māori are increasingly evident within the programme.</p><p>Children benefit from good indoor/outdoor flow in the learning environment. They enjoy the challenge of physical play and discovery. Parents/whānau support children's developing love for storytelling and books well. Children's learning opportunities are enhanced by regular excursions.</p><p>Infants and toddlers enjoy sharing a play environment with older children. Both younger and older children benefit from this integration in play where leadership and tuakana/teina opportunities are promoted well.</p><p>Centre members follow a distributed model of leadership that promotes their capacity building. Playcentre adult education promotes the use of effective teaching strategies that support children's learning through play. The centre has a strategic plan that is improvement focused. Centre members are developing internal evaluation processes.</p><p>The regional structure is replacing individual Playcentre Associations. Newly appointed regional personnel are making good progress building on existing systems and establishing effective regional management structures for supporting centres. Centre support workers are guided by regional centre support coordinators. Systems are being developed for monitoring the quality of programmes for children, adult education levels, and health and safety requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps for centre improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring programme planning and the use of teaching strategies help children to develop complexity in their play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to promote a bicultural programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation processes to promote ongoing improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The Northern North Island Playcentre regional manager (acting) and support personnel agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implementing and embedding the revised Playcentre adult education programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing a framework to evaluate the effectiveness of centre support systems, roles and processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Henderson Valley Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>7 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed</li>
<li>Well placed</li>
<li>Requires further development</li>
<li>Not well placed</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
