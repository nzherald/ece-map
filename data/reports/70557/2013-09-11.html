</table><p>Lincoln University Early Childhood Centre is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lincoln University Early Childhood Centre is situated in the grounds of Lincoln University. It is one of two centres managed by Lincoln Hospitality Limited, a subsidiary of the university. The centre provides education and care for the children of students and teaching staff from Lincoln University as well as children from the local community. The centre is licensed for 33 children aged from birth to school age. Families from many cultures use the centre. The centre has a focus on promoting environmental sustainability and is part of enviroschools and Lincoln Envirotown Trust. An experienced centre coordinator oversees the day-to-day operation of the centre. During 2012, there were some changes to the teaching team. Teaching staff have qualifications in Early Childhood Education and two staff are in training.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and teachers share warm, caring relationships. Teachers know children and their families well and work together to support children’s wellbeing and development. Particular attention is given to supporting babies and toddlers to develop close relationships with key teachers.</p><p>Children’s home cultures are celebrated and parents are encouraged to share aspects of their culture with the teachers and children. Teachers use a number of ways to provide parents with information about their children’s learning and centre happenings. Parents are often asked for their opinions on how well the centre is meeting their children’s needs.</p><p>Teachers effectively notice and respond to children’s interests and developing skills. Children’s ideas and opinions are highly valued and used for planning the programme. They are actively involved in interesting and challenging activities. Teachers also clearly incorporate <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum, in the programme, wall displays and as part of plans and assessments for individual children.</p><p>Teachers use a wide range of high-quality teaching practices in the nursery and preschool. These practices help children’s language development. Teachers skilfully ask questions that encourage children’s deeper thinking across all areas of the curriculum. They have a sound understanding of te ao Māori (Māori world view) and include te reo and tikanga Māori meaningfully in the programme and environment.</p><p>The centre has a strong focus on sustainability and the natural environment. A large number of natural resources are provided for children to explore. Good use is made of the university and local resources to also support children’s learning.</p><p>Teachers work together in a strong team culture with a shared philosophy. They regularly reflect on their teaching practices and share information about individual children’s interests and learning. Teachers support each other well within the programme. The centre coordinator ensures that good use is made of individual teacher strengths and passions to support the whole teaching team. Teachers are given many opportunities to share and develop their leadership skills.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre coordinator and teachers have made good use of their professional discussions and self review to reliably identify the next steps for the centre's development.</p><p>They are in the early stages of trialling some new systems to improve the areas they have identified. They now need to make sure these new systems are monitored for effectiveness and successfully become a regular part of centre practices. These include:</p><ul>
<li>appraisal practices for individual teachers</li>
<li>recent initiatives to strengthen assessment</li>
<li>new processes for guiding centre self review.</li>
</ul><p>They have also identified a next step is to extend the role of children in assessing their own learning and contributing to centre self review.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lincoln University Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lincoln University Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>11 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
