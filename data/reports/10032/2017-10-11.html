</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Community Kindy Marne Road is licensed to provide education and care for up to 30 children over two years of age. Children play together in the centre's generous indoor and outdoor spaces.</p><p>The centre is part of the BestStart organisation, which provides a strong management framework. It also provides a range of support services and personnel, including a professional services manager (PSM) and a business manager (BM) to support the smooth operation of the centre.</p><p>The qualified teachers have become an established and collaborative team. The manager and teachers are currently focusing on the review of their centre's philosophy with the goal of making it easier for parents to understand.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report noted several areas of good practice that supported children to be confident and capable learners. The report identified development priorities, including strengthening the assessment of children's learning and reflecting the Treaty of Waitangi in the centre's philosophy. Progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews in the BestStart organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are capable and competent learners. They confidently engage with their teachers and each other. Children are inclusive and readily invite others to join in their play. They are caring and considerate of each other.</p><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging in the centre. Indoor and outdoor environments are attractive and well organised. Children access all areas freely. They interact well, direct their own play and sustain their interest and involvement in activities over time. Daily routines provide a flexible and responsive structure that works effectively for children. As a result, children are confident in the learning environment.</p><p>Centre managers work well together to reflect on operations and to promote positive outcomes for children. They have high expectations of teachers' practice. Managers' respectful and caring approach influences relationships and the general tone of the centre. Teachers notice and respond to children's immediate care and wellbeing needs. They are particularly responsive to a small group of children with special learning needs. Teachers also have a good overview of children's long term development.</p><p>Teachers provide a programme that builds children's social competence and encourages them to be thinkers. They identify children's common interests and find ways to stimulate their learning and extend their knowledge. Wall displays encourage children to revisit their learning.</p><p>Local walks offer 'real life' opportunities for children within the local area. Teachers find innovative ways for children and the centre to connect with the community during these outings. Other excursions provide children with good opportunities for learning experiences.</p><p>Teachers take a genuine interest in children's play. They gently affirm and support children's ideas and opinions as they develop their working theories. Teachers are developing their capacity to use te reo Māori within the programme. Children confidently experiment with waiata and poi.</p><p>Managers and teachers build strong, supportive relationships with parents. They are responsive and respectful in providing support for whānau. Parents who spoke to ERO reported that their initial visits to the centre gave them confidence that the service would meet their children's needs.</p><p>Teachers provide parents with good information to explain how learning through play supports children to be ready for school. Parents contribute learning stories from home that often build on or relate to events or experiences their children have had at the centre.</p><p>BestStart continues to provide good support for centres through professional development opportunities, management documentation and a range of quality assurance processes. PSMs and BMs maintain positive relationships with centre personnel and have high expectations for centre performance.</p><p>The challenge for PSMs is to use their current focus on teaching as inquiry and newly developed mentoring processes to help centre managers and teachers achieve the high quality practices that BestStart values. Community Kindy Marne Road provides a good model for other centres that are establishing these practices. Recent work to establish goal-focused strategic plans in each centre should also help to facilitate meaningful improvements in teaching and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps for centre improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>teachers continuing to find ways to respond to individual children's 'passions' and interests to extend their learning</li>
<li>continuing to incorporate whānau aspirations into planning, and recording children's progress toward achieving these goals</li>
<li>extending the range and use of outdoor resources so that children's exploration and imaginative play are promoted.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Community Kindy Marne Rd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Community Kindy Marne Rd will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>11 October 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
