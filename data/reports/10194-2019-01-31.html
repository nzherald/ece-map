</table><p>Pascals Herne Bay is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pascals Herne Bay is licensed for 100 children, including up to 25 aged under two years. It previously operated as Bayfield Early Education Centre. Infants, toddlers and older children have separate indoor and outdoor play spaces, and also have regular opportunities to mingle and explore the wider centre.</p><p>The centre manager and three head teachers lead the recently established teaching team. The centre's philosophy places the child at the heart of what teachers do. It focuses on respect for the holistic child, strong relationships, a stimulating environment, acknowledgement of Māori as tangata whenua, and the importance of professional teaching practice.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report identified that the centre required professional advice and guidance to enact the centre's vision and philosophy, raise the quality of curriculum and build the capability of teachers and staff new to centre leadership positions. The centre has made significant progress in these areas.</p><p>The centre is part of the Evolve Education Group’s Upper North Island region. Evolve provides an overarching governance and management framework. The intent of a recent re-branding of Evolve services has been to build a greater sense of unity across the organisation. It has allowed each centre to identify a preferred philosophical approach.</p><p>Recent Evolve initiatives are intended to improve staff retention, promote effective internal evaluation and lift the quality of teaching practices. A new general manager and area managers provide professional support for centre leaders and teachers. Further recruitment is underway for managers to lead a focus on continuing quality improvement across the organisation. There continues to be a period of transition for staff as they adapt to changes in Evolve operational practices.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the Evolve Education Group, Upper North Island region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have very good opportunities to explore the well-resourced environment and follow their interests. They demonstrate a sense of belonging and wellbeing, happily playing with and alongside their peers. Children benefit from caring, supportive interactions with adults. Well implemented care routines promote their independence. Teachers encourage children to develop respect for the environment, respect and care for each other, and to be responsible. Children can grow as competent and confident learners in this environment.</p><p>Centre leadership is focused on improving the quality of teaching and learning across the centre. Recent initiatives promoting positive outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a focus on implementing the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, beginning with Whakamana</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an inquiry into the impact of transitions into, within and out of the centre in terms of children's sense of wellbeing and belonging, and continuity of their care and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a deliberate focus on building the capacity of head teachers to lead and support professional practice improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>renovation of the indoor play spaces and purchase of furnishings and resources to create inviting, stimulating learning environments that respond to the changing interests and abilities of infants, toddlers and older children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Centre leaders are keen to embed meaningful, reciprocal relationships with parents, whānau and the wider community, within the ongoing operations of the centre. They have focused on improving communication with parents/whānau, and provide good opportunities for parents to comment on centre developments and contribute to events. A well-established relationship with the nearby primary school helps build children's confidence about their transition. Centre leaders are now beginning to focus on how they can widen their connections within the local community.</p><p>The centre is managed effectively. Leaders have a clear vision for the ongoing development and improvement of the centre. There are cohesive links between this vision, the centre philosophy, and the strategic and annual plans that guide the centre's development. Annual centre audits established by Evolve help managers to ensure legal requirements are being met regarding policies, procedures and curriculum. A robust internal evaluation process results in changes to teaching practices and improved outcomes for children. Leaders and teachers are open to learning, and continue to question and modify their practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree their key next steps include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop assessment, planning and evaluation practices across the centre to better identify and document children's learning over time, and incorporate and respond to parents' aspirations for their children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embed the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi in pedagogical practice and curriculum documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build leadership capacity in the centre in order to create a more cohesive teaching team and strengthen the continuity of education and care across different age groupings.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During ERO’s August 2018 cluster, Evolve Education Group Managers agreed that next steps included:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increased integration of the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the alignment of strategic goals and annual plans with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitoring the roles and responsibilities of leaders at organisation and centre levels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the effective implementation of appraisal practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This current cluster review also identified the need for:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a coherent change management strategy, and monitoring the effectiveness of the new structure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support for centres through changes of key leaders, including area and centre managers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the evaluation of teaching and learning across the organisation, to inform the next steps in PLD and the development of the teaching and learning teams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>high quality PLD for area managers to help them to evaluate and promote quality provision for children, and to identify priorities for supporting centre managers.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pascals Herne Bay completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">Next ERO Review</span></h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pascals Herne Bay will be in three years.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>31 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
