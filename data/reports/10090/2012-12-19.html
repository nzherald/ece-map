<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>This service is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Meadowood Community Creche operates under the guidance and direction of Meadowood House Incorporated. It is a non-profit community licensed early childhood centre (ECE), situated on the North Shore of Auckland City. It operates on a sessional basis, catering for more than 120 children of mixed ages, each week. The centre maintains strong relationships with wh&#257;nau, the wider community, tertiary education providers, researchers and special education, and social services.</p><p>Staffing has remained stable. Three of the four staff are ECE qualified and teacher registered. The experienced supervisor has been with the cr&egrave;che for over ten years. Professional learning and development has focused on building a culture of inquiry and catering well for children with identified special needs.</p><p>Since ERO&rsquo;s 2009 report improvements have been made to the outside environment. The centre was relicensed by the Ministry of Education in March 2012.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Management and staff continue to work towards promoting positive outcomes for children. Children are confident and competent learners. They play and learn well together and enjoy opportunities to problem solve and negotiate with adults and with each other. Teachers are sensitive to the interests and needs of individual children. This is reflected in their support of the development of children&rsquo;s social, interpersonal, and fine and gross motor skills.</p><p>Teachers share a variety of skills and experience. They promote children&rsquo;s well being. Interactions are warm and respectful and nurturing relationships are evident among children and adults. The teaching and learning programme is interest based and generally responsive to children&rsquo;s preferences. It is informed by observations and discussions between teachers and parents.</p><p>A strong partnership exists between the centre and families of children with identified special needs. Teachers work hard to ensure these children are able to play and learn alongside their peers and with each other. Their progress is well documented and the findings are discussed with parents. Close contact is maintained with service providers and support networks.</p><p>Systems for assessment are manageable and work well. Regular discussions keep teachers focused on wh&#257;nau aspirations for their children. A review of assessment processes is timely. This should ensure assessment practice remains relevant, guides future planning and sustains and promotes a strong teaching and learning culture.</p><p>M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau are embraced into the centre environment and culture. In its practices the centre acknowledges and reflects the unique place of M&#257;ori as tangata whenua. Learning experiences provide opportunity for M&#257;ori children to feel confident about their culture and heritage. Basic te reo M&#257;ori is used and practised along with waiata, and celebrations such as Matariki are enjoyed by all children and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>The creche has continued to maintain strong links with its community. Wh&#257;nau attend regularly and support the centre programme. They are encouraged to share their cultural stories and experiences, in their home language, with children and with teachers.</p><p>The experienced centre supervisor is supportive and encouraging. She promotes inclusive centre practices. Every effort is made to include teachers and wh&#257;nau in decision-making processes. Involvement in a three year information communication technology (ICT) year contract has developed teacher skills, knowledge and expertise in the use of a range of tools and resources. A positive outcome has been the development of more effective communication, and reporting to wh&#257;nau and the community.</p><p>Self review is well established and documented. The centre philosophy and strategic priorities are set and underpin centre planning and decisions. Policies are regularly reviewed. Teachers work collaboratively to support new initiatives and centre developments.</p><p>Areas for review and development include the following. The supervisor and teachers should consider:</p><ul>
<li>evaluating the programme to show how well the curriculum and teaching practices are impacting on children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>reviewing the suitability of the learning environment and curriculum provision for children up to two years old</li>
<li>reviewing the design of the physical environment and resourcing to allow optimum opportunity for all children to sustain their play in creative and meaningful ways.</li>
</ul><p>Addressing these matters should ensure centre management, staff and wh&#257;nau remain focused on continued improvement.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Meadowood Community Creche completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>19 December 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues.
