<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Fairleigh Kindergarten is a long-established, community-based and not-for-profit kindergarten.</p><p>The way that teachers and parents work together to support children&rsquo;s learning is a strong feature of the kindergarten.</p><p>A stable, fully-qualified teaching team has provided continuity for children and families over a number of years.</p><p>The parent-led management committee and teachers have dealt with the impact of the Canterbury earthquakes on the kindergarten roll and buildings well. They have responded positively to the needs of the community and now provide mixed-aged sessions for 3 and 4 year old children.</p><p>This review took place on the first day of Term 1, 2013, after children and teachers had had a lengthy holiday break. Children returned to the kindergarten with enthusiasm and confidence. Teachers effectively supported new children to settle into the programme.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Teachers are welcoming and inclusive of children and their families. They respond positively and sensitively to children and provide a caring and nurturing learning environment.</p><p>Routines are predictable and give children a sense of security.</p><p>Teachers have extended conversations with children that help to foster their language development. They appropriately allow children to make decisions about the nature and direction of their interests during free-play times. They also recognise and value children&rsquo;s efforts and successes.</p><p>Children have good opportunities to develop independence and take responsibility for themselves and others and their environment. They play happily with and alongside others.</p><p>Teachers increasingly use te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in ways that are meaningful to children and respectful of the M&#257;ori culture.</p><p>Children benefit from the attractive, spacious and inviting indoor and outdoor areas. Teachers support children to use a range of good-quality resources to develop their play ideas and, in particular, to extend their literacy, numeracy and physical skills.</p><p>The kindergarten is well led and managed. The head teacher provides supportive leadership and focused direction for ongoing improvements to teaching and learning. She makes good use of teachers&rsquo; strengths to lead aspects of curriculum development. Teachers are encouraged to use new approaches to improve the quality of teaching and learning and reflect on the impact of these.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>The teaching team has appropriately identified that aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation, and self review need further development.</p><p>Teachers have begun to broaden their assessments of children&rsquo;s learning to include children&rsquo;s attitudes, skills and knowledge. Priority should now be given to:</p><ul>
<li>identifying and documenting the ways that teachers intend to extend children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>showing children&rsquo;s progress over time more consistently</li>
<li>making better use of children&rsquo;s individual assessments to plan the programme</li>
<li>regularly evaluating how well the planned programme and teaching practices are improving children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><p>The head teacher and teachers recognise the need to develop a shared understanding of, and processes for guiding, effective self review. This development should include:</p><ul>
<li>a planned, systematic approach, including clear procedures and guidelines</li>
<li>a stronger focus on teaching and learning</li>
<li>documented evidence of the process and outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>ERO recommends that the teaching team reviews how well the planned group times are catering for individual children&rsquo;s learning strengths and capabilities.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Fairleigh Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><p>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</p><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>15 March 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
