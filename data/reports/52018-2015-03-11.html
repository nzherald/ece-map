</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Terrace End Playcentre is one of 19 administered by the Central Districts Playcentre Association (the association). This review is one of ten undertaken by ERO in the association’s playcentres during Term 4, 2014.</p><p>The centre is open for three mornings per week and caters for children from birth to six years of age. Responsibility for day-to-day operations is undertaken by centre-elected office holders. A paid facilitator supports parents and whānau to develop and implement the daily programme. Professional advice and feedback to strengthen members’ practice is provided by a liaison officer employed by the association.</p><p>Over the past year a complete change of parent committee members has occurred. The new team are working to establish processes to guide centre operations. At the time of this review, all parents at this centre are undertaking Playcentre training.</p><p>Playcentres' philosophy statement, 'whānau tupu ngātahi – families growing together', encapsulates the value this organisation places on families and whānau working collectively to support children’s learning. This playcentre has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation is currently reviewing the organisational structure of Playcentre across New Zealand. The outcomes of this review may result in changes to operation at centre level.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Adults engage responsively with children. Members have a flexible approach to planning daily sessions linked to children's emerging interests and Playcentre philosophy. Creativity is encouraged. Literacy, numeracy and mathematics are well integrated into the programme in the context of play and everyday happenings. Infants and toddlers are active participants in all aspects of the programme. They confidently explore the playcentre environment.</p><p>Members provide a wide variety of high quality resources and learning materials. These are freely available for children. The outdoor area provides good opportunities for physical play and adventurous activities. Children enjoy the environment with its many opportunities for investigation and independent learning.</p><p>Through the use of information and communication technologies adults share information about children’s developing interests which may be used to plan suitable activities for subsequent sessions. They agree that review and development of their approach to assessment, planning and evaluation should continue to be a priority.</p><p>Te ao Māori is reflected through waiata, signage, and some use of te reo Māori. Adults are working to ensure children have experiences that assist them to become confident in Aotearoa New Zealand’s dual cultural heritage. Acknowledged next steps are to continue to develop strategies and approaches to effectively promote Māori children’s success as Māori.</p><p>Children with diverse learning needs are well supported in an inclusive environment.</p><p>Centre members work collaboratively to put systems in place to guide centre practices and operations. Self review is in the very early stages of development. It is responsive and beginning to be understood by parents. They should continue to develop self review practice to enable ongoing improvement.</p><p>Useful support is provided by the association. This includes written guidelines and systems for managing finance and legislative obligations. Work is being completed to improve employment practices. Regular visits from the liaison officer assist members in their management and teaching roles. A review of the liaison officer role is being undertaken to support an improved approach.</p><p>The appraisal process, particularly for those employed as team leaders and liaison officers, needs further development. The provision of ongoing professional, constructive feedback based on observations of practice, and linked to identified needs and goals, should add rigour.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At association level, the priorities are the further development of:</p><ul>
<li>members’ understanding of assessment, planning, evaluation and self review</li>
<li>liaison support, so it is consistently effective in identifying and responding to centre needs</li>
<li>appraisal for employees</li>
<li>members’ understanding about te ao Māori.</li>
</ul><p>At centre level, the priorities are:</p><ul>
<li>developing all members’ participation and understanding of assessment, planning, evaluation and self review</li>
<li>increasing parents’ confidence to further incorporate te ao Māori throughout the curriculum</li>
<li>acquiring strategies and approaches to effectively promote Māori children’s success as Māori</li>
<li>raising awareness of Playcentre in the local community to promote participation in early childhood education and grow the centre roll.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Terrace End Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Terrace End Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>11 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
