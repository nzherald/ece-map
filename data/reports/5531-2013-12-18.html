</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Winton Kindergarten is located in the small rural town of Winton, in Central Southland.</p><p>The kindergarten is licensed for 40 children. The children who attend the kindergarten come from a diverse range of backgrounds and cultures.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2010, there have been several changes to the teaching team, including the appointment of three new teachers. The very experienced and long-serving head teacher is leading and managing the kindergarten very well.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy for teaching and learning is strongly evident in practice. The kindergarten aims to provide a welcoming, caring and nurturing environment for all children, whānau and caregivers. Children’s learning is fostered within a rural setting where community spirit is valued.</p><p>The learning programme and environment supports high quality relationships between children, teachers and whānau. Teachers have high expectations for children’s learning. Children are seen as competent and capable learners.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor environments are very well resourced. They are purposefully arranged to foster, mystery and curiosity in children. Children’s work is respectfully displayed. Spaces are thoughtfully designed to invite and inspire learning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 23 kindergarten reviews in the Southland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from a rich curriculum that builds complexity and deepens their learning. The kindergarten’s philosophy and vision guides all aspects of learning and teaching. Children learn and play in an unhurried and stimulating environment. Teachers, children and families learn together. There is a strong use of the arts and information and communication technologies (ICT) to transform and provoke children’s thinking and creativity.</p><p>Children enjoy a wide range of experiences in and beyond the kindergarten. A project approach gives them opportunities to drive their own learning. The specially designated project room allows them to work for sustained periods and revisit their learning.</p><p>Children benefit from high-quality teaching. Teachers are skilled at talking with and listening to children. They build on their strengths, interests and abilities. They actively listen to children and support their learning through careful questioning and providing explicit feedback. They make effective use of ICT to make learning visible and accessible to whānau and the wider community. Teachers make good use of natural resources to extend children’s learning. They are very aware of including Māori perspectives in meaningful ways.</p><p>Children and whānau are very well supported as they enrol and move into the kindergarten. Teachers very quickly develop partnerships with parents and regularly consult and inform them about their child’s learning and the learning intentions of the programme. They seek multiple ways of building and supporting whānau relationships and using them to enrich the programme. ERO observed respectful relationships that foster a strong sense of belonging in this kindergarten.</p><p>Children develop strong friendships with one another and are confident to explore and share their knowledge and understanding with others. Parents who spoke with ERO were very positive about the quality of learning and care their children receive.</p><p>The head teacher shows a strong commitment to the philosophy and vision of the kindergarten.</p><p>She has developed effective systems and has high expectations for teaching and learning. The head teacher fosters collaborative ways of working. She makes very good use of the individual interests of teachers.</p><p>There are very good processes for undertaking self review. Self review is focused on improving outcomes for children.</p><p>The Kindergarten South governors consulted widely when developing the vision and goals that guide the long-term direction of the association. They have high expectations that the association and each kindergarten will:</p><ul>
<li>involve the community</li>
<li>provide natural learning environments</li>
<li>do what is best for children</li>
<li>be a good employer.</li>
</ul><p>Governors and staff have a clear understanding of the roles of governance and management in the association. They have developed a useful policy framework and guidelines that support the day-to-day and long-term operation of the kindergartens.</p><p>The advisory support teachers provide useful feedback and guidance to staff and endorse the high expectations set by the board of governors. Winton Kindergarten benefits from strong ongoing support from the general manager and other association staff.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>A further enhancement to current good practice would be for the teachers to refine processes and documentation for planning, assessment and self review.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Winton Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Winton Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>18 December 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
