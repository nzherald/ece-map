</div><div class="WordSection3">
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Talented Tots and Learning Centre in Mt Albert is one of four privately owned and operated centres. &nbsp;This centre provides care and education for children up to five years of age. &nbsp;The centre has had some changes in staffing since the 2009 ERO review.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Children settle quickly, making choices in their play and enjoying friendships with their peers.&nbsp; They trust teachers and are eager to participate in the programme.&nbsp; Children are articulate and engage in frequent sustained and complex conversations during their play.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Teachers have established positive relationships with parents. &nbsp;Communication and consultation processes are well established between teachers and parents.&nbsp; Parents express satisfaction with the care given to their children. &nbsp;Teachers complete attractive and informative portfolios to record children&rsquo;s time in the centre and share learning with wh&#257;nau. &nbsp;Parents have regular opportunities to contribute to their child&rsquo;s portfolio.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The programme is developing and teachers are making good progress in improving their practice.&nbsp; The environment is welcoming, and a variety of resources and equipment is available for children to explore.&nbsp; <b></b></p>
<p class="ReportText">Managers have established regular reporting systems and many sound management practices support all aspects of the centre operations.&nbsp; Teachers appreciate the professional development opportunities provided for them.&nbsp; Ongoing professional development should help teachers continue to improve their teaching practices.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Managers have identified a need to strengthen understanding of bicultural practices and the use of te reo M&#257;ori in all their centres.&nbsp; Some teachers use te reo M&#257;ori incidentally in the programme and are beginning to teach children about tikanga M&#257;ori practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ReportText">Managers could support teachers to extend the learning environment and the programme in order to strengthen children&rsquo;s learning opportunities.&nbsp; They should also continue to develop self-review practices so that ongoing improvements are guided by research in early childhood education.</p>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">Future Action</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Before the review, the management of Talented Tots Childcare &amp; Learning Ctr was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO.&nbsp; ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff.&nbsp; This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atTalented Tots Childcare &amp; Learning Ctr.</p>
<p class="ReportText">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education.&nbsp; For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Background</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">The 2009 ERO report noted important strengths in the centre, including good self review and happy, confident children. Staff were encouraged to continue to build their skills in the use of te reo M&#257;ori. A new supervisor is in the process of establishing more shared teaching practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">The owner/managerhas provided professional development to assist staff to meet centre goals. &nbsp;An education manager gives support and guidance to all the staff in the four centres.</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Areas of strength</h4>
<p class="ReportText">Independent learners. &nbsp;Children are independent learners. &nbsp;They make choices from the programme offered. &nbsp;They are confident and articulate.&nbsp; Older children make decisions with adults regarding their play.&nbsp; Friendships between children are evident. &nbsp;Some children engage in sustained independent play.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Relationships.&nbsp; Relationships between teachers and children are positive and parents appreciate the care taken of their children.&nbsp; The supervisor and teachers are starting to build a cohesive team. &nbsp;They are developing ways that will strengthen their partnership with parents and the local community.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Environments.&nbsp; The learning environment includes attractive displays of children&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; &nbsp;The addition of awnings on the deck area encourages children&rsquo;s use of this space.&nbsp; The outdoor climbing structures provide children with challenges and opportunities for appropriate risk taking.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Literacy and numeracy.&nbsp; Early literacy and numeracy are encouraged and are visible in the environment. Teachers could now continue to develop and extend on ways that will creatively build literacy and numeracy into children&rsquo;s play.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Management. The management team has established regular reporting systems and sound management practices, including good self-review procedures, to support all aspects of centre operations.</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Areas for development and review</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Programme planning and delivery.&nbsp; Management should continue to support teachers to develop greater consistency in how they plan and deliver the programme. &nbsp;The supervisor and teachers should consider how they could:</p>
<ul>
<li>interact more effectively with children as they play</li>
<li>continue to extend children&rsquo;s thinking by providing more challenging and complex learning opportunities</li>
<li>show ongoing progress of each child&rsquo;s learning and development in portfolios</li>
<li>provide resources to further support a learning programme that is more responsive to children&rsquo;s emerging and ongoing interests.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">Strengthening teaching practice. Improvements are being made to the programme structure and children&rsquo;s assessment. &nbsp;The supervisor could now work with teachers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>continue to improve and strengthen teaching practices and build on staff professional knowledge</li>
<li>explore ways to consult with parents of M&#257;ori children to encourage them to share their aspirations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">Environments for children up to two years old.&nbsp; The supervisor and teachers should review the layout of the indoor and outdoor spaces for children up to two years of age.&nbsp; At present there is no designated outdoor space for these infants and toddlers. &nbsp;The indoor environment should support infants&rsquo; and toddlers&rsquo; learning by having an extensive range of resources for them to explore. Managers also should ensure that staff transition toddlers to the over-two area according to their readiness, and not on centre ratio needs.</p>
<a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Before the review, the staff of Talented Tots Childcare &amp; Learning Ctr completed an ERO Centre Management Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist.&nbsp; In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures.&nbsp; ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportBullet">In order to improve current practice the supervisor and teachers should:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensure documented health and hygiene practices are adhered to</li>
<li>develop a shared understanding of the level of noise acceptable in the centre.</li>
</ul>
<a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendations</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO and the centre managers agree that the centre supervisor and teachers should:</p>
<p class="Recommendation" style="padding-left: 30px;">4.1 review the learning environment and programme to provide more experiences for children that challenge them and that promote more complex learning and thinking.</p>
<p class="Recommendation" style="padding-left: 30px;">4.2 use indicators of good practice to guide more robust and comprehensive self-review processes.</p>
<a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children.&nbsp; Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.&nbsp;</p>

</div><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-talented-tots-childcare-and-learning-ctr" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Talented Tots Childcare &amp; Learning Ctr</h2><p class="ReportText1stPara">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on&nbsp;Talented Tots Childcare &amp; Learning Ctr.</p><p class="ReportText1stPara">Talented Tots and Learning Centre in Mt Albert is one of four privately owned and operated centres. This centre provides care and education for children up to five years of age.&nbsp; The centre has had some changes in staffing since the 2009 ERO review.</p><p class="ReportText">Children settle quickly, making choices in their play and enjoying friendships with their peers.&nbsp; They trust teachers and are eager to participate in the programme.&nbsp; Children are articulate and engage in frequent sustained and complex conversations during their play.</p><p class="ReportText">Teachers have established positive relationships with parents. Communication and consultation processes are well established between teachers and parents.&nbsp; Parents express satisfaction with the care given to their children. Teachers complete attractive and informative portfolios to record children&rsquo;s time in the centre and share learning with wh&#257;nau.&nbsp; Parents have regular opportunities to contribute to their child&rsquo;s portfolio.</p><p class="ReportText">The programme is developing and teachers are making good progress in improving their practice.&nbsp; The environment is welcoming, and a variety of resources and equipment is available for children to explore.&nbsp; <b></b></p><p class="ReportText">Managers have established regular reporting systems and many sound management practices support all aspects of the centre operations.&nbsp; Teachers appreciate the professional development opportunities provided for them.&nbsp; Ongoing professional development should help teachers continue to improve their teaching practices.</p><p class="ReportText">Managers have identified a need to strengthen understanding of bicultural practices and the use of te reo M&#257;ori in all their centres.&nbsp; Some teachers use te reo M&#257;ori incidentally in the programme and are beginning to teach children about tikanga M&#257;ori practices.&nbsp;</p><p class="ReportText">Managers could support teachers to extend the learning environment and the programme in order to strengthen children&rsquo;s learning opportunities.&nbsp; They should also continue to develop self-review practices so that ongoing improvements are guided by research in early childhood education.</p><h3 class="MSHeading2">Future Action</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p class="ReportText">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take.&nbsp; You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p class="ReportText1stPara">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.&nbsp;</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3 class="MSHeading2">About ERO</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3 class="MSHeading2">About ERO Reviews</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews.&nbsp; The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p class="ReportText">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s &nbsp;self review.</p><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Focus</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review.&nbsp; ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.<b></b></li>
</ul><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Coverage</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues.&nbsp; The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Recommendations</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement.&nbsp; A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue.&nbsp; There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
