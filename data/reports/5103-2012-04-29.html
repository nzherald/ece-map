<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Sandringham Kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association. It provides five morning and three afternoon sessions for up to 30 children per session. The kindergarten&rsquo;s culturally diverse parent community is actively involved in supporting teachers to provide high quality educational programmes for their children.</p><p align="left">Two new teachers, appointed at the end of 2011, have focused on developing a positive environment and culture for learning. They have built on the strong, positive community relationships and high quality teaching practices evident in the 2008 ERO report. The teachers have worked hard to enrich the environment, improve programme documentation and increase children&rsquo;s engagement in interesting and challenging learning experiences. They have clearly articulated their philosophy, values and beliefs about teaching and learning, and identified appropriate curriculum priorities. They have established a sound foundation for ongoing self review and are focused on continually improving the quality of outcomes for children.</p><p align="left">Programme and assessment records show how teachers plan and work with children purposefully to help them extend their ideas. Children freely explore the richly resourced, attractively presented play areas that invite exploration. Literacy learning, including the use of information and communication technologies (ICT), is well supported. Mathematics and science concepts are also integrated in children&rsquo;s play in meaningful ways. Imaginative role play and creativity are features of children&rsquo;s work. There is an unhurried atmosphere where children are actively engaged in self-directed and increasingly complex learning. They demonstrate a growing sense of themselves as capable and independent learners and competent communicators.</p><p align="left">The teachers have developed an annual plan that indicates how they will build on the significant improvements made since November 2011 and are beginning the process of longer-term strategic planning. This planning should enable teachers to consolidate and expand recently introduced practices and provide a framework for moving towards identified goals and their vision for the future.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Sandringham Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atSandringham Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The kindergarten provides three afternoon sessions for younger children and five mornings for older children. During 2011 the kindergarten&rsquo;s permanent teachers retired. Relieving teachers facilitated programmes for a period prior to the current permanent teachers being appointed in November 2011.</p><p align="left">The Ministry of Education&rsquo;s process of relicensing the kindergarten under the 2008 early childhood education regulations will be completed before this report is published.</p><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s 2008 report commented on strong, positive community relationships and high quality teaching practices. With the support of the parent community and the kindergarten administrator/teacher aide, the new teaching team has worked hard to build on these strong foundations. ERO recommended extending the use of ICT, strengthening partnerships with parents and improving self-review practices. Significant progress has been made in these areas.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Curriculum priorities. The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy and teaching and learning statements show teachers&rsquo; deep understanding of theories and best practice in early childhood education. Teachers emphasise the benefits of strong relationships and a richly resourced environment and view children as capable and competent learners. They value manaakitanga, kindness and respect, and foster understanding of the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa. ERO finds, and parents confirm, that these factors are apparent in practice and effectively support children&rsquo;s learning. Programme and assessment records celebrate the ways that curriculum priorities are enacted in the kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Learning environment. Respectful trusting relationships and a calm, welcoming atmosphere are features of the kindergarten. These factors contribute to a secure and inclusive emotional environment, and a strong sense of belonging amongst children and their families.</p><p align="left">Teachers have created thoughtfully resourced and presented play areas that provide children with a wide selection of interesting and challenging choices. Children use equipment flexibly and also use a variety of technologies (ICT) to support their developing ideas. Natural resources are incorporated in play areas. Displays provide prompts for children and very good information for parents about children&rsquo;s learning. They show how children revisit and build on previous experiences. Children and parents are involved in adapting the environment in response to children&rsquo;s evolving interests.</p><p align="left">Teaching practice. Teachers&rsquo; practice reflects their view of children as capable and competent. Their skilful practices include:</p><ul>
<li>modelling, and having clear expectations about respect for people and the environment</li>
<li>listening carefully, engaging in meaningful conversation, inviting and responding to children&rsquo;s ideas, and valuing their contributions</li>
<li>supporting children to make decisions, solve problems, and increase the complexity of their play</li>
<li>providing many opportunities for children to enjoy books and experiment with writing, and integrating mathematics, science and creativity in authentic ways in the context of play</li>
<li>encouraging children to be independent at snack times and to take responsibility for the environment</li>
<li>writing high quality learning stories for individual children and &lsquo;stories of interest&rsquo; that show how children&rsquo;s interests and activities evolve, and how positive dispositions for learning develop over time.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Children respond well to teachers&rsquo; high expectations. They work together collaboratively, extend play ideas over time, and are increasingly capable and independent.</p><p align="left">Self review. Teachers invite and value parents&rsquo; feedback and work closely with an active parent committee towards improvements in the kindergarten. Through their review and development of guiding documents teachers have established a strong basis for ongoing self review.</p><p align="left">Continual reflection on teaching and learning is a feature of teachers&rsquo; dialogue and documentation. They take advantage of professional development opportunities to examine and refine their own practice in order to deepen their understanding and continually enhance provision for children.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">In the short time since November 2011, teachers have made a significant positive impact in terms of teaching, learning, and quality of the environment. They have recently introduced a variety of new systems and practices. Teachers&rsquo; plans for further development include the outdoor environment, the quality of children&rsquo;s portfolios and the use of ICT. Improvements could also include:</p><ul>
<li>ensuring that all children&rsquo;s individual portfolios contain equally high quality assessment and recognise and value children&rsquo;s cultural and language backgrounds</li>
<li>recording significant aspects of teachers&rsquo; daily de-brief meetings</li>
<li>expanding bicultural practices through deepening understanding of manaakitanga and other M&#257;ori concepts, and integrating te reo M&#257;ori to a greater extent.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Teachers have begun to plan strategically for continuing progress over time.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Sandringham Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre ManagementAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><p>29 April 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-sandringham-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Sandringham Kindergarten</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Sandringham Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Sandringham Kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association. It provides five morning and three afternoon sessions for up to 30 children per session. The kindergarten&rsquo;s culturally diverse parent community is actively involved in supporting teachers to provide high quality educational programmes for their children.</p><p align="left">Two new teachers, appointed at the end of 2011, have focused on developing a positive environment and culture for learning. They have built on the strong, positive community relationships and high quality teaching practices evident in the 2008 ERO report. The teachers have worked hard to enrich the environment, improve programme documentation and increase children&rsquo;s engagement in interesting and challenging learning experiences. They have clearly articulated their philosophy, values and beliefs about teaching and learning, and identified appropriate curriculum priorities. They have established a sound foundation for ongoing self review and are focused on continually improving the quality of outcomes for children.</p><p align="left">Programme and assessment records show how teachers plan and work with children purposefully to help them extend their ideas. Children freely explore the richly resourced, attractively presented play areas that invite exploration. Literacy learning, including the use of information and communication technologies (ICT), is well supported. Mathematics and science concepts are also integrated in children&rsquo;s play in meaningful ways. Imaginative role play and creativity are features of children&rsquo;s work. There is an unhurried atmosphere where children are actively engaged in self-directed and increasingly complex learning. They demonstrate a growing sense of themselves as capable and independent learners and competent communicators.</p><p align="left">The teachers have developed an annual plan that indicates how they will build on the significant improvements made since November 2011 and are beginning the process of longer-term strategic planning. This planning should enable teachers to consolidate and expand recently introduced practices and provide a framework for moving towards identified goals and their vision for the future.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)&nbsp;</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
