</table><p>Glorious Kids Homebased Childcare is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Glorious Kids Homebased Childcare has operated for two years. It provides education and care for 49 children in South Auckland. The majority of children are Samoan. A small number of children are from other Pacific backgrounds. Educators reflect the cultures of the children attending.</p><p>Most children are in educators' homes for up to six hours a day. Some educators have one group of children in the mornings, and a different group in the afternoons.</p><p>The philosophy for the service states that te Tiriti o Waitangi is a guiding document in helping children to gain knowledge and understanding about the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. The philosophy also recognises <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, as underpinning the holistic learning and development programmes provided for children.</p><p>The service is privately owned and managed. It employs a qualified coordinator to provide support for educators and children. This role includes monitoring the implementation of expectations for health and safety provisions and educational programmes. The service provider attends the fortnightly playgroup and staff meetings to maintain contact with educators and parents.</p><p>Most of the educators hold some form of early childhood education qualification. The service provider has the expectation that all educators will engage in training that increases their knowledge and understanding about children's learning and development.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of Glorious Kids Homebased Childcare.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Strong relationships underpin all aspects of the service. The overriding emphasis in this service is on children and the quality of their education and care. The service provider and coordinator consistently seek ways of promoting and encouraging high quality. They work closely towards meeting their shared, clear vision for the future. A recent survey indicates that parents are confident in and appreciative of the service and of the care their children receive.</p><p>Service leaders set high expectations for quality practice from educators. They promote and support a curriculum based on <em>Te Whāriki</em> that is generally play based. The learning recorded in children's portfolios reflects their development over time through their interests and the activities provided for them. Photographs in portfolios and from playgroup show children engrossed and happy in their play.</p><p>Good progress is being made in acknowledging New Zealand's bicultural curriculum. Educators receive good support materials to encourage their inclusion of te reo me ōna tikanga Māori in programmes. Samoan influences in programmes are strong, with good planning to further develop this aspect of practice. The service recognises, acknowledges and celebrates educators' efforts.</p><p>Service leaders provide regular, planned opportunities for educators to meet and engage in professional development. They are responsive to needs identified by educators, and provide a wide range of resources to support programmes. Regular home visits provide positive feedback about good practices, and educational support. Parents are also invited, and take part in events and in the playgroup.</p><p>Leaders have made good progress in establishing sound systems for guiding developments. They have a strong commitment to ongoing improvement. They use internal evaluation well to determine needs and to prioritise the next steps for the service. Policies and procedures are in place to guide educators and to ensure legal requirements are met. It is timely now for leaders to increase the rigour of internal evaluation, and to investigate the effectiveness of service operations and provision for children to date.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Next steps for the service include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>foster children's learning in meaningful contexts as part of play, and promote the impact educators can have in facilitating children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen educators' knowledge about curriculum, and enhance teaching practices aligned with <em>Te Whāriki</em> and parents' aspirations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support educators' evaluation practices, with an increased focus on outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Glorious Kids Homebased Childcare completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practices, leaders should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>update the Child Protection policy and procedures to include timely referrals to external agencies as required</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that the endorsement of practising teacher certificates is based on current Teaching Council requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Glorious Kids Homebased Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>20 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
