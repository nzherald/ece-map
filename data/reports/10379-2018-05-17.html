</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bright Stars Early Education Centre changed ownership in August 2016 and is undergoing redevelopment. The centre is licensed for up to 65 children, including up to 20 under two years of age. The centre has three main buildings and adjoining outdoor areas that cater for age-related groups of children. More than half of the children identify as Māori, and there are small numbers of children from diverse ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>The new owner, Provincial Education Group, has a substantial management team to oversee the operation of a large number of early childhood centres throughout New Zealand. Operations and Education managers provide close support for the new centre manager and staff, including seven registered teachers. They are updating centre documentation.</p><p>The centre's philosophy, which is currently under review, is consistent with the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. It acknowledges the dual heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand, and advocates for respectful and inclusive practices. The centre provides meals for children, and a van to transport children to and from the centre.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report identified that children were well cared for, that the programme was inclusive and that children were able to manage their own play. Identified key next steps related to developing consistently good practices across the centre and strengthening strategic planning. The new managers have reviewed many aspects of centre operations to support ongoing development in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from respectful relationships and interactions with teachers and other staff. They have significant uninterrupted periods that allow them to explore their environment and develop their play.</p><p>Children up to two years of age are respectfully nurtured. Their teachers are attentive. They monitor and respond appropriately to the needs, routines and rhythms of individual children. Children's interests and dispositions are supported in the programme.</p><p>The centre is inclusive of children of all cultures and those with additional learning needs. The fee structure and van transport assist parents to access early childhood education for their children.</p><p>The environment reflects children's cultures and successfully supports their learning. It is well designed and well resourced. Children move freely between the indoor and outdoor areas. The indoor area provides well for children to develop their play in a variety of spaces. Older children access the transition-to-schoolroom where there is a 'readiness for school' focus.</p><p>Centre managers recognise the importance of providing an environment that promotes children's oral language and early literacy development. Staff are enrolled in professional learning and development (PLD) that aims to enhance their knowledge and practices in this area. PLD to support teachers' engagement with <em>Te Whāriki</em> 2017 is also planned. This has the potential to strengthen partnerships with parents, and support assessment and planning.</p><p>Teachers recognise the need for a more bicultural approach to the educational programme. A plan has been established to support greater inclusion of te ao Māori by building teachers' knowledge of te reo and tikanga Māori.</p><p>Transitions into and through the centre, and on to school are well supported and managed. Parents of new children are encouraged to spend time in the centre. Children up to two years are able to get to know the teachers and children in the adjacent area. Centre staff have built a constructive relationship with the neighbouring primary school.</p><p>The centre manager and the area manager are well supported by Provincial Education managers. They work collaboratively to provide leadership for the centre. Other staff members are actively supported to take leadership roles. Managers have recently improved the teacher appraisal process. The system promotes teacher accountability and is improvement focused.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers agree that staff should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen their assessment of children's learning, planning of the educational programme, and evaluation of its impact on learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to build a te ao Māori approach to the programme that acknowledges the aspirations of parents of Māori children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bright Stars Early Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bright Stars Early Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>17 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">.</a><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"></a></span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
