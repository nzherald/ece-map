</table><p>BestStart Newmarket is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>BestStart Newmarket is licensed to provide full-day education and care for up to 49 children, including 15 aged under two years. Infants and toddlers have their own separate indoor and outdoor play space. The roll includes children from a range of diverse cultures.</p><p>The centre is part of the BestStart charitable trust. The organisation has re-branded all its early learning services. BestStart provides an overarching governance and management framework to support operations and curriculum delivery in individual centres. Business Managers (BM) and Professional Services Managers (PSM) facilitate staff professional development and provide strategic guidance.</p><p>The curriculum is underpinned by the principles of <em><span lang="mi">Te Whāriki</span></em>, the early childhood curriculum, bicultural practices and partnerships with parents/whānau. These values and principles are integrated with the philosophy of Reggio Emilia. Emphasis is placed on providing a welcoming environment that caters for individual children's needs and encourages them to engage with challenges.</p><p>ERO’s 2016 report noted children's culture and language and identity were valued alongside the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa. Respectful and caring relationships between teachers and children supported independence and self-management. Areas for development included aligning key documentation, strengthening learning stories and deepening reflection in internal evaluation. The centre has made good progress in these areas. Since the report a new centre manager appointed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the BestStart Upper North Island region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s sense of wellbeing and belonging is affirmed in a learning environment where their language, culture and identity is valued and promoted. Children are warmly welcomed by staff on arrival. Positive, respectful relationships and strong connections with teachers and peers help children to settle quickly.</p><p>Children are friendly and confident learners. They are supported by teachers to develop independence. Children play cooperatively with their peers for sustained periods of time. They have opportunities to explore and be physically active in a well-resourced environment that encourages imagination and creativity.</p><p>Teachers’ sensitive, nurturing and respectful interactions with infants, toddlers and whānau result in a calm, settled environment and promote a strong sense of belonging. Routines are unhurried, allowing children opportunities to learn and explore their environment. Children's individual needs and communication styles are well catered for. Infants early language attempts are well supported by teachers.</p><p>Teachers and leaders have an ongoing commitment to developing bicultural practices. They model <span lang="mi">te reo and tikanga</span> Māori. Children are encouraged to support each other in <span lang="mi">tuakana/teina</span> relationships. The programme supports children to learn about their own and other cultures and languages. Cultural events are celebrated. Parents/whānau are involved in the life of the centre.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively to ensure positive outcomes for children. They encourage parents to be involved in the learning programme and keep them well informed of their child’s progress. Teachers are aware of children’s interests and respond positively and respectfully to their questions and ideas. They use intentional, deliberate teaching approaches to develop children’s specific skills and knowledge.</p><p>Good systems for internal evaluation guide teaching practice, which results in improved practices that promote positive outcomes for children. Professional learning and development is focused on building teacher capabilities and has impacted positively on teaching practices. The service provides opportunities for emergent leadership within the team.</p><p>National, regional and centre operations are guided by strategic and annual plans, and a shared vision which monitor quality and promote ongoing improvement. These are linked to BestStart strategic goals, which promote a sense of belonging to a wider learning community and support more widespread collaboration amongst teaching teams. Professional learning and development have a focus for building capabilities and has impacted positively on teaching practices. The service provides opportunities for leadership within the team.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps for the centre's development include continuing to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers' professional capability to support children to co-construct and take ownership for their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation by deepening data analysis of data and reviewing the effectiveness of post evaluation changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>partnerships with whānau in planning, assessment and evaluation of programmes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Agreed next steps for the organisation are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>bicultural understanding and practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>risk analysis management systems, processes and procedures for excursions</p>
</li>
<li>appraisal processes to support teachers’ continuum of professional knowledge and practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of BestStart Newmarket completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>8 May 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
