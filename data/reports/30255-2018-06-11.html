</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Greenpark Pre-school is a privately owned and operated education and care centre located in a residential suburb of Tauranga. It is licensed for 45 children from birth to school age, including up to 16 under the age of two years. At the time of this ERO review 57 children were enrolled, including six who identify as Māori.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy promotes whanaungatanga – where relationships are a focus to enhance children’s learning. The philosophy documents the intent to celebrate the achievement and to support children’s progress without interference through movement, and a peaceful respectful approach to learning.</p><p>Since the previous ERO report in 2015, the centre has reviewed assessment, planning and evaluation processes, redesigned the outdoor area in the infant/toddler space, and further developed the appraisal system.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s learning is effectively promoted through responsive and respectful teaching. Relationships are positive and affirming between teachers and children. Teachers have established collaborative partnerships with parents focused on their children’s learning. Children are encouraged to extend their thinking through in-depth discussions and gain confidence and competence through relationships with their teachers.</p><p>Children experience a challenging and rich, well-resourced environment. A wide range of learning opportunities are fully accessible to all learners. Children lead their own learning, and their independence is fostered successfully by teachers through a flexible and inclusive programme. Literacy, numeracy and science are purposefully integrated into the learning programme. Planning, assessment and evaluation identifies children’s developing skills and knowledge and shows progress over time.</p><p>Children under the age of two experience respectful and nurturing relationships in a calm and settled environment. They are supported to make choices and decisions about their learning and be independent and challenged through play. Children’s rights are promoted through respectful interactions with teachers. Children with additional learning needs are encouraged to achieve success through close relationships with key teachers. Positive transitions into, through and out of the centre support children's confidence and sense of belonging.</p><p>Teachers effectively model appropriate language to promote children’s oral literacy. Positive and engaged interactions between teachers and children support social competence. Responsive teaching practices support children for whom English is a second language. The outside learning environments support risk taking and problem solving, and cater for a range of interests and skill development. Children benefit from a curriculum that provides the opportunity to explore, inquire and follow their own interests.</p><p>Teachers promote te reo Māori, waiata, karakia and tikanga practices to build on children’s knowledge of te ao Māori. A bicultural curriculum has been developed and the centres vision and strategic planning identify a commitment to further improve this. Children are supported to develop knowledge about New Zealand/Aotearoa and the uniqueness of its bicultural heritage.</p><p>Leaders have established a reflective learning environment. Leadership opportunities for teachers are provided through the appraisal system which is enhancing teacher capacity and capability. Leaders have fostered a culture of collaboration through effective consultation that promotes positive partnerships between parents and teachers. Leadership has successfully established a culture where all children are valued and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning.</p><p>Effective governance promotes positive learning outcomes for all children. Clear policy, procedures, systems and effectively guide daily operations. The centre vision and philosophy, is well-established and promotes quality teaching practice. Internal evaluation includes a strategic approach to change management leading to improvement. Children experience an environment where high-quality opportunities underpinned by effective governance and management processes and practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and ERO agree that to further improve teacher practice:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teaching as inquiry needs to be aligned with the centre’s strategic vision to further build teacher capacity and capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers should undertake internal evaluation to strengthen children's connectedness to their language culture and identity.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Greenpark Pre-school completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>all workers who have access to children are safety checked in accordance with the vulnerable children's act 2014 - a record of all safety checks and the results.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7A]</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Greenpark Pre-school will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>11 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
