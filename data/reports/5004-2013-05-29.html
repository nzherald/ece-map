<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Hillcrest Kindergarten is well placed to continue to provide positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Hillcrest Kindergarten has provided early childhood care and education in Kaikohe for the past 60 years. Many of the children who currently attend have wh&#257;nau who formerly attended the kindergarten. This continuity of service has generated strong links with the community. The kindergarten operates extended day sessions, with 30 children attending morning sessions and twenty staying on for the afternoon on most days. The majority of children attending have M&#257;ori heritage.</p><p>The kindergarten comes under the umbrella of the Northland Kindergarten Association. The Association provides sound frameworks for the management and operation of the service. It also provides hands-on professional support. Professional development builds the capacity of teachers to sustain quality and improve outcomes for children and wh&#257;nau. The kindergarten has three qualified teachers who work varying hours to provide consistent education for children. Issues faced by staff include the transience of some children and the variable attendance patterns of some.</p><p>The centre philosophy developed by teachers includes reference to Te Tiriti o Waitangi as a founding document for New Zealand, and their intention to honour this. The principles and strands of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, are woven through programmes. Relationships with children, wh&#257;nau and the wider community are viewed as underpinning teachers&rsquo; practice. Wh&#257;naungatanga and kotahitanga are seen as important to creating an inclusive culture for children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Teachers continue to promote positive outcomes for children, as noted in the centre&rsquo;s 2009 ERO report.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are highly reflective and use research and self review to investigate and share new learning about what is important for children in this centre. They develop respectful relationships with children and their wh&#257;nau. Close observation of, and lively conversations with, children enable teachers to recognise their strengths, dispositions and learning needs.</p><p>Children are independent and enthusiastic about their play. They take pleasure in the company of other children and collaborate well in complex, imaginative games. Teachers encourage children to respond to conversations and to play in friendly ways. Children are beginning to show respect for the kawa of the kindergarten and whanaungatanga is evident in play. Children are highly engaged when they are interested in activities or daily routines, such as mat times. Teachers could now consider how daily routines can be best managed to ensure they attract and sustain children&rsquo;s interest.</p><p>Teachers have a growing understanding of biculturalism and bicultural practices. A teacher with particular strength in te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori supports other teachers in their learning. The community also contributes to teachers&rsquo; understanding. Teachers are committed to continuing this aspect of their learning.</p><p>The kindergarten is well supported by families and the wider community. Wh&#257;nau are appreciative of their children&rsquo;s learning. They are comfortable to be in the centre and to share their ideas with teachers. They are an integral part of the kindergarten and contribute feedback about programmes and reviews undertaken.</p><p>The Association has presented Hillcrest Kindergarten with an award and funding grant to help with the upgrading of its outdoor area. This has made a significant improvement to the attractiveness and usability of this area, and has increased learning challenges and skill development opportunities for children. Teachers are currently researching and reviewing the centre environment to explore ways in which it can best contribute to children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Assessment and planning processes are regularly reviewed to determine the match between documentation and the differing strengths and needs of children. Self review of all aspects of teachers&rsquo; work with children is regular, and often undertaken in collaboration with parents. Teachers should now consider revising their review strategies in order to better streamline these.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and teachers agree that the next key steps for the kindergarten are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen wh&#257;nau voice in portfolios and reflect children&rsquo;s part in planning more explicitly</li>
<li>ensure that discoveries from research are embedded in centre practices and reviewed regularly for continued effectiveness</li>
<li>focus on children&rsquo;s social competence in all aspects of play and centre routines.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Hillcrest Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>29 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
