</table><p>Hora Hora Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hora Hora Kindergarten is one of 22 kindergartens governed and managed by the Northland Kindergarten Association (NKA). It is situated close to the central business district of Whangarei and provides six-hour sessions each day for up to 40 children over the age of two years. Families attending the kindergarten have diverse ethnic backgrounds, with approximately one-third being Māori.</p><p>The team consists of a head teacher, three other registered teachers, an administrator and a qualified lunch cover staff member.</p><p>The kindergarten's philosophy values te reo and tikanga Māori, ako (community of learners), ngā hononga (relationships), and te taiao (environment). It emphasises the importance of providing opportunities for all children to become confident in their own cultural identity and promotes respectful relationships with children and their families. The philosophy stresses the development of the whole child in establishing positive attitudes and approaches to learning.</p><p>Positive features identified in the 2015 ERO report continue to be evident. Some progress has been made with the 2015 next steps, particularly in supporting children in mixed-age engagement and the team approach to improving programmes.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine kindergarten reviews in the Northland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers welcome children and their whānau into a calm, inclusive environment. Children settle quickly and confidently to self-chosen activities, making connections with friends and engaging them in play. They are eager to talk with teachers and to explore the environment. Teachers encourage children to be confident decision-makers.</p><p>Children have positive relationships with teachers and are developing social skills as they play enthusiastically and cooperatively with their peers. Children are becoming familiar with te ao Māori through waiata, karakia and cultural activities. Teachers value and respect family cultures. Several children with additional learning needs are well supported through effective use of Government equity funding.</p><p>Teachers provide a wide variety of resources and learning experiences to extend children's interests, learning and development. Teachers regularly discuss the programme and children's learning, particularly their social development and emotional wellbeing. Teachers should now make next learning steps more visible through a documented planning and evaluation process.</p><p>Teachers have very good working relationships with parents and whānau. Parents who talked with ERO are enthusiastic about the opportunities their children have at the kindergarten and the relationships they have with teachers. They value how well teachers know their children and how they support children to be independent learners. Some parents comment on their children's learning stories to provide teachers with feedback.</p><p>Teachers work well as a team. They are building a cohesive and collaborative approach to teaching and enhancing children's strengths and interests. Teachers are well supported by their professional practice manager (PPM). She is regularly involved with them in programme decision making. Teachers are committed to and participate in ongoing professional development.</p><p>Professional practice managers (PPM) regularly visit kindergartens to provide leadership and curriculum guidance for teachers. A Pou Whakarewa Tikanga Māori Advisor works closely with teachers to increase their understanding of and focus on authentically threading te ao Māori into learning programmes. There is an organisation-wide emphasis on providing high quality resources and equipment for children. Leaders and teachers value and respect the thoughtful use of natural resources.</p><p>The Association provides a comprehensive policy and procedure framework that sets clear expectations and guides teachers’ practice. It has developed relevant appraisal and teacher inquiry processes that reflect the Teaching Council’s guidelines. Each kindergarten’s annual plan aligns to the Association’s strategic vision, values and goals. NKA employs a speech language therapist and seconds a social worker from Family Works to provide targeted support for children, whānau and teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing and supporting leadership in the kindergarten</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consolidating assessment, planning and evaluation processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Key next steps for Association-wide development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing assessment, planning and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepening understanding of evaluative thinking and internal evaluation processes to measure the effectiveness of systems and practices across the Association.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hora Hora Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>15 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
