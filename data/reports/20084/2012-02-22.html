<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Kindercare Learning Centres (3) is located in the inner city suburb of Grey Lynn, Auckland. The centre provides good care and education for children from birth to school age. Three age groups, babies, toddlers and pre-schoolers, each have their own appropriately resourced room. The toddlers and pre-schoolers, aged approximately 18 months to 5 years, share a well designed outdoor area. Younger toddlers and babies can communicate freely with their friends and siblings in the outdoor area.</p><p align="left">Children settle quickly when they arrive at the centre and engage in age-appropriate play. Teachers greet children and their parents and discuss the children&rsquo;s experiences in, and outside of, the centre. Children have positive relationships with others and friendships are well established. Teachers are attentive to the care of the younger children. They maintain babies&rsquo; individual routines for sleep and meals.</p><p align="left">Children enjoy the wide range of activities available and confidently ask for additional equipment to extend their play. They enjoy significant periods of time when they can play uninterrupted by centre routines. Children participate enthusiastically during mat time and enjoy social opportunities during morning tea and lunch.</p><p align="left">Teachers&rsquo; interactions with children are positive and supportive. They plan programmes based on children&rsquo;s interests and support them with appropriate resources. They take an interest in children&rsquo;s play and engage them in discussions. They could now consider using more open-ended questions to develop children&rsquo;s curiosity and to encourage them to discover other directions for their play.</p><p align="left">The centre is well managed and managers constantly reflect on centre operations to maintain on-going improvements. More systematic self review could now be developed. Kindercare provides good management systems to ensure that early childhood education regulations are adhered to and good health and safety practices are followed.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kindercare Learning Centres (3) was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kindercare Learning Centres (3).</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Many children who are approaching school age started in the babies&rsquo; room and most of the staff have been working in the centre for several years. This stability means that families and children are well known to teachers.</p><p align="left">The centre is owned and operated by Kindercare Learning Centres. Kindercare management personnel visit the centre regularly to provide on-going management and curriculum support.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Environment. The centre environment is well designed to make good use of the available space and teachers regularly review the layout of rooms to maximize opportunities for children. Each area is appropriately resourced and play equipment is accessible to the children. Children move about freely in appropriately resourced areas. All children are able to interact with one another.</p><p align="left">Relationships. Children have trusting and supportive relationships with teachers. They are developing good social skills and play well together. Teachers know the children and their families well and take an interest in their lives beyond the centre. Staff work well together to ensure that information about children is shared and that centre operations run smoothly.</p><p align="left">Interactions. Teachers work closely with children and support them to make decisions about the direction of their play. They are affirming and supportive when interacting with children. Teachers provide good models for the development of children&rsquo;s oral language skills.</p><p align="left">Care for younger children. The young children are well cared for in an appropriately resourced environment. Teachers follow the routines of individual children so that meal and sleep times suit the children.</p><p align="left">The programme. The programme allows children to play uninterrupted for extended periods of time. While there are set mat and meal times, children can choose to return to activities after these breaks. The programme provides opportunities for children to develop early literacy and numeracy knowledge and skills in the context of play. Teachers share books informally with children during the day.</p><p align="left">Planning and assessment. Programme planning and assessment processes encourage teachers to identify and plan for children&rsquo;s emerging interests. Planning is shared on large display boards that are added to and changed as children&rsquo;s interests evolve. Children&rsquo;s learning stories are valuable assessment tools and are used to guide the programme. Teachers are supported by managers to refine their assessment practices.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Extending children&rsquo;s thinking. Teachers should continue to reflect on the strategies that they use to extend children&rsquo;s thinking and learning. Strategies could include a greater focus on using open-ended questions and giving children more time to respond when they engage in conversation with teachers. The older children&rsquo;s programme could include further opportunities for children to engage in more complex activities that have a focus on developing their thinking skills.</p><p align="left">Self review. The centre manager is reflective and constantly reviews centre operations. However, the centre would benefit from a systematic approach to selfreview. Similarly, teachers could conduct a more structured review of the teaching and learning programme. This process could promote greater reflection on children&rsquo;s learning and should lead to improved practice.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Kindercare Learning Centres (3) completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2><p align="left">ERO and the centre managers agree that teachers should continue to explore ways to extend the learning of the older children in the context of play.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table style="width: 568px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kindercare-learning-centres-3" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kindercare Learning Centres (3)</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kindercare Learning Centres (3).</p><p align="left">Kindercare Learning Centres (3) is located in the inner city suburb of Grey Lynn, Auckland. The centre provides good care and education for children from birth to school age. Three age groups, babies, toddlers and pre-schoolers, each have their own appropriately resourced room. The toddlers and pre-schoolers, aged approximately 18 months to 5 years, share a well designed outdoor area. Younger toddlers and babies can communicate freely with their friends and siblings in the outdoor area.</p><p align="left">Children settle quickly when they arrive at the centre and engage in age-appropriate play. Teachers greet children and their parents and discuss the children&rsquo;s experiences in, and outside of, the centre. Children have positive relationships with others and friendships are well established. Teachers are attentive to the care of the younger children. They maintain babies&rsquo; individual routines for sleep and meals.</p><p align="left">Children enjoy the wide range of activities available and confidently ask for additional equipment to extend their play. They enjoy significant periods of time when they can play uninterrupted by centre routines. Children participate enthusiastically during mat time and enjoy social opportunities during morning tea and lunch.</p><p align="left">Teachers&rsquo; interactions with children are positive and supportive. They plan programmes based on children&rsquo;s interests and support them with appropriate resources. They take an interest in children&rsquo;s play and engage them in discussions. They could now consider using more open-ended questions to develop children&rsquo;s curiosity and to encourage them to discover other directions for their play.</p><p align="left">The centre is well managed and managers constantly reflect on centre operations to maintain on-going improvements. More systematic self review could now be developed. Kindercare provides good management systems to ensure that early childhood education regulations are adhered to and good health and safety practices are followed.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p></html>
