</table><p>Tai Tapu Playcentre is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tai Tapu Playcentre operates under the guidance of the Canterbury Playcentre Association. The playcentre is a parent cooperative with parents encouraged to be involved in all aspects of the programme and centre operation.</p><p>Tai Tapu Playcentre operates five morning sessions a week. It is located in the Tai Tapu Hall. The hall is safe to occupy but sustained damage in the 2010 and 2011 Canterbury earthquakes. The future of the hall is uncertain. The parents and the association are working with the Ministry of Education and the Selwyn Council to ensure the playcentre has suitable premises.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster review of seven playcentres in the Canterbury Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn and socialise in a well organised and presented playcentre programme. Many of the adults have been involved in the centre for a number of years and willingly share their skills and knowledge of playcentre and the best ways for children to learn.</p><p>The playcentre provides a warm, friendly and inviting environment for children and adults. Children are well supported by adults who have a good knowledge of each child and effectively use a range of approaches to help children develop their thinking, problem solving and social skills.</p><p>The coordinators and parents have clear and well understood roles and responsibilities for the programme and the administration of the centre. Adults' skills and interests are well used to strengthen the programme and ensure the smooth operation of the centre.</p><p>The environment is well resourced and provides well for the infants, toddlers and children up to school age. Adults have made appropriate use of self review to improve the provisions for under- two-year-old children and extend the interests of children near school age. Literacy and numeracy are integrated into the programme in ways that engage children in meaningful learning.</p><p>Leadership is actively promoted. The three coordinators completed their training at this centre. Children’s comments are regularly sought as part of the centre’s self review. Older children willingly look after and include younger children in their play.</p><h3>Canterbury Playcentre Association</h3><p>The association has effective systems and practices for monitoring health and safety, and parent involvement in the centres. The association’s support team visits assist centre staff to meet the association's expectations for the daily operation of the centre.</p><p>The association centre support team provides a vital link between the parents and the association. In centres where this link is strong, ERO found the centres received good quality targeted support. In these centres the coordinators and parents worked effectively as a parent cooperative. They had well defined roles and responsibilities and were able to provide evidence that the centre’s programme was extending children’s learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps for the Canterbury Playcentre Association</h3><p>The association is undertaking major restructuring. A new manager was appointed in April 2014. The playcentre philosophy provides a good foundation for the association to build its vision and make the changes for the organisation and its centres. Plans to support the achievement of this vision have yet to be put in place.</p><p>Next steps for the association should include:</p><ul>
<li>clearly documenting the association’s future goals, plans and progress</li>
<li>making clear links from the association’s strategic plans to centre plans, and association and centre self review</li>
<li>strengthening the support provided to centre support team members through more targeted professional development and robust appraisal</li>
<li>providing ongoing documented feedback from the centre support team to parent groups about the quality of teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Key next steps for Tai Tapu Playcentre</h3><p>The association, centre parents and ERO agree that the next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>clearly documenting future goals, plans and progress to ensure the ongoing improvement of the programme and learning outcomes for all children</li>
<li>strengthening self review by developing a better understanding of the process and the focus on learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>reviewing assessment and planning processes to help adults identify children’s learning and the ways that adults can help children with their learning</li>
<li>strengthening the focus on Māori achieving success as Māori</li>
<li>making closer links between coordinators’ appraisals, centre goals and learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Tai Tapu Playcentre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tai Tapu Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>16 July 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
