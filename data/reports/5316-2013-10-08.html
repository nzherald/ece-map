</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Brown Owl Kindergarten is located in Timberlea, Upper Hutt. It is licensed for 40 children aged two years and over and operates three all-day sessions and two morning sessions per week. Since the previous ERO review, there have been a number of significant changes to teaching staff and the current team has recently been formed. The head teacher has been in her role since the beginning of the year.</p><p>Over the past three years there have been review focuses on transitions to school, routines, assessment and self review. Significant progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed effectively by the Rimutaka Kindergarten Association (the association), and its senior teachers provide support. It is committed to maintaining the ratio of 100% of teachers qualified. Well-developed policy guidelines clearly outline association expectations for developing the programme and managing day-to-day operation.</p><p>The association coordinates the Upper Hutt Professional Learning Community (UPLC) cluster. This focuses on teachers from both the early childhood and primary sectors regularly meeting to support positive transitions to school for children. Brown Owl Kindergarten is part of this group.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eleven kindergarten reviews in the Rimutaka Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are welcoming and respectful. Children relate well with their peers and show a strong sense of belonging within their environment. Teachers have established sound relationships with children and families. They are responsive to opportunities to support parents, families and children. The atmosphere is calm. Children lead their learning and enjoy engaging in play for long periods of time. They are able to work independently and in groups.</p><p>Teachers encourage children to think about their learning. They talk about virtues and qualities to foster positive relationships between children. Children&rsquo;s wellbeing is highly promoted by teachers.</p><p>Children with special needs are well planned for. Teachers use external agencies when appropriate to support the child and family. All children are supported and included in the programme.</p><p>The environment reflects the focus on environmentally sustainable practices and provides ample opportunities for children to explore, be creative and challenge themselves. Literacy and numeracy learning are effectively integrated into the programme. Opportunities for children to use information and communication technologies are provided to support and extend their learning.</p><p>A bicultural programme is evident and is the foundation for M&#257;ori children to achieve success as M&#257;ori. Self-review processes are well developed and have led to improving opportunities and outcomes for all children. The philosophy is evident in practice. However, teachers have identified that review is needed to be sure the philosophy reflects the new teams' shared beliefs. ERO affirms this decision.</p><p>Planning documentation has recently been reviewed and changes made. Assessment shows children&rsquo;s participation and includes planning for next steps. Teachers successfully identify children's learning and are beginning to reflect contributions that parents make through the learning stories. There is a consistent approach to planning and assessment.</p><p>The recently appointed head teacher promotes shared leadership, allowing teachers to use their skills and strengths. Children, parents and wh&#257;nau are provided with many opportunities to lead within the kindergarten. Parents are encouraged to be a part of the programme in a variety of ways.</p><p>Transitions to school are well monitored. Teachers provide useful information for parents. They have established regular reciprocal visits with a local school and have positive relationships with other schools in the wider area. The head teacher has identified that a review of these processes is timely and ERO's findings support this judgement.</p><p>Senior teachers provide well targeted, ongoing support and guidance for staff. They promote regular professional development opportunities and systems for fostering positive outcomes for children. Recently implemented performance appraisal processes have the potential to enhance teachers' practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, teachers and leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen how parents' aspirations are reflected in children&rsquo;s profiles. This should allow teachers and parents to enhance partnerships in supporting children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>consider how planning, assessment and evaluation processes can be aligned so that assessment documents show how teachers are deepening learning for children</li>
<li>strengthen teachers' understanding of how to support M&#257;ori and Pacific children to experience success while upholding their cultural identity.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Brown Owl Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Brown Owl Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>8 October 2013<img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt=""></p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
