</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Orakei Kindergarten is located across the road from Orakei Primary School in East Auckland. The centre offers education and care for a maximum of 40 children over the age of two years. In 2013, the buildings were upgraded and the kindergarten changed from providing two half-day sessions per day to the kindergarten day model. This change enables children to attend sessions that match school hours.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA) and operates within the policies and management framework of this organisation. A professional services manager (PSM) visits regularly and provides management and curriculum support for teachers.</p><p>The 2011 ERO identified many areas of good performance in the kindergarten. The new teaching team are all fully qualified, and have sustained and further developed the good teaching practices evident at the time of the previous review. Teachers participate in a range of professional development activities and are led by a well respected head teacher.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy places importance on providing a welcoming culture that values the natural environment. Strong, trusting relationships as the foundation for learning are evident. Children come from diverse backgrounds and teachers and parents celebrate this cultural diversity in the programme.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed by teachers. Parents and whānau spend a lot of time in the centre, sharing information with teachers and seeing their children learning through play. Teachers continue to explore ways to support parents’ aspirations for their children and to respond to these aspirations in the kindergarten’s curriculum.</p><p>Children have fun and are competent, articulate learners. They enjoy the opportunities provided for challenge and learning in the expansive and well resourced environment. They confidently settle themselves in play areas and make deliberate choices about the resources and equipment they need. Teachers affirm children as capable learners by listening patiently to their responses and ideas and by consistently reinforcing appropriate behaviour.</p><p>Good quality assessment practices are in place to monitor children’s learning. Stories in portfolios highlight what children are learning and how they are progressing. Parents contribute to their child’s portfolio and enjoy sharing this with other family members.</p><p>Teachers have worked hard to establish strong relationships with families and the wider community. They seek parent contributions about children’s learning and play interests at home. Parents have good opportunities to be included in all aspects of their child’s development at the kindergarten. The focus on enviroschool practices, in particular, enables children, families and the wider community to contribute to the programme. A strong relationship with the local primary school has also been developed, and children and families are invited to participate in visits between the school and kindergarten.</p><p>Teachers are committed to offering a bicultural curriculum. They continue to develop their own knowledge of tikanga Māori and local history to help enrich the programme for children. They are beginning to establish Māori concepts to underpin learning, and use elders from the local marae to guide this curriculum development.</p><p>A feature of the kindergarten is the approach taken by the head teacher to grow and share leadership skills. Teachers meet regularly to discuss planning and assessment, to review policies and to reflect on practice to improve outcomes for children. The team is well positioned to develop a more in-depth process for self review to help teachers further improve teaching and leadership.</p><p>The Auckland Kindergarten Association has good systems for self review and accountability to guide kindergarten management, and it continues to provide effective governance for kindergartens. The AKA has a strong commitment to biculturalism and to implementing strategies that support kindergartens in promoting positive outcomes for all children. The association is currently reviewing the appraisal process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to build on current good practice the PSM and teachers agree that key next steps could include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening self review to improve the quality of teaching and learning practices</li>
<li>continuing to develop teachers' leadership roles</li>
<li>professional development to increase teachers' understandings about and inclusion of bicultural practices in the curriculum.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Orakei Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Orakei Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>12 September 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
