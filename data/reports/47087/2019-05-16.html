</table><p align="center" style="text-align: left;">Kiddz Homebased Childcare is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p align="center" style="text-align: left;">ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiddz Homebased Childcare is a long established, privately owned education and care service. It has two networks operating under the Kiddz Homebased umbrella. This is the first report for this network.</p><p>The service provides in-home education and care for up to 80 children. Educators are supported by visiting teachers to deliver learning programmes in their own home for up to four children at any one time. The owner and senior leader form the management team. Three other trained and registered teachers comprise the visiting-teaching team.</p><p>Children who attend the service come from diverse cultures, with the majority being Chinese. The manager employs three translators to support visiting teachers to communicate with these educators and families.</p><p>The service philosophy emphasises the importance of positive relationships, allowing children to have time and opportunity to lead and contribute to their own play and learning. Opportunities for inquiry and real life experiences are seen as essential elements within the homebased setting and on excursions into the community. The philosophy is based on the values of Ngā Hononga, Whanaungatanga, Manaakitanga, Ako and Kaitiakitanga. Outcomes for children are at the heart of all decision making.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy caring and nurturing relationships with their educators. These lead to children having a strong sense of belonging. Children learn to respect and care for themselves and others in meaningful ways. Their language and culture are respected, highly valued and provide the basis for their learning.</p><p>Infants' and toddlers' learning and wellbeing benefit from educators close knowledge of and understanding of their individual preferences and requirements. Children with special abilities are well supported. The management team has established purposeful relationships with a range of professional organisations and agencies. Visiting teachers work collaboratively with families to support positive outcomes for these children.</p><p>Educators know the children well and know how to respond to help them learn. They use children's interests to provide a deep and rich curriculum. Educators and visiting teachers have growing partnerships for learning with parents to help guide planning for children. Educators are very well supported by the visiting teachers, translators, ongoing training and useful systems to provide meaningful programmes for children in their homes, the local community and the service's playgroup.</p><p>The philosophy is evident in the design of the curriculum. The managers and visiting teachers are committed to Treaty-based practices and Māori values are the foundation for the local curriculum. They are providing good support for educators and children to develop a growing awareness of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori. These practices are supporting Māori children to succeed as Māori.</p><p>Managers are improvement focused. They are developing their capability and collective capacity to do and use internal evaluation. They have a useful process for internal evaluation that focuses on learning outcomes for children. Through the use of an innovative tool managers are in the early stages of making good use of data to know about the effectiveness of teaching and learning.</p><p>Managers effectively identity key priorities for improvement and plan how these will be achieved over time. Related planning is well aligned to these priorities. Managers need to monitor and evaluate how well they have achieved the key priorities. The operational handbook provides useful guidance for the day-to-day operation of the service. There is an appropriate appraisal system to improve the practice of visiting teachers. Carefully considered systems are in place to ensure compliance requirements are met.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the managers and visiting teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>evaluate the effectiveness of teaching strategies on individual children's learning and progress</li>
<li>extend and deepen the use of data to know how well teaching is impacting on the learning of all children in relation to service learning priorities</li>
<li>monitor processes to be assured that service policies and systems are being implemented.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiddz Homebased Childcare completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>16 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
