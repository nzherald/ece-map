</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kelburn Little School is a privately owned early learning service located in Wellington. It is one of a number of services under the Little Schools' umbrella. It provides education and care for up to 57 children including up to eight under the age of two years. Enrolled families represent a diverse range of cultures.</p><p>The philosophy places importance on developing foundations for lifelong learning and enabling a smooth transition to primary school.</p><p>Little Schools' management team comprises three qualified and experienced early childhood and primary school teachers. The owner has a clear vision for the organisation and is responsible for setting overall strategic and policy direction. Mentor teachers monitor the quality of teaching and learning and support teachers’ ongoing professional learning and growth. At this centre, two head teachers have day-to-day responsibility for the teaching team.</p><p>The April 2015 ERO report identified that the Kelburn Little School team should continue to improve understanding of review and appraisal. Progress is ongoing.</p><p>This review is one of three reviews of centres in the Little Schools' organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers and leaders are highly committed to the Little Schools' philosophy and vision. Strong values underpin the preschool and its culture. Leaders acknowledge that it is timely to review the philosophy in consultation with the school community. ERO affirms this decision.</p><p>Children confidently engage in a range of teacher designed activities. Literacy, oral language, mathematics and science are strongly promoted. Teachers make connections to children's cultures, languages and identities through the environment, activities and celebrations.</p><p>Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are evident in the programme. Children have opportunities to become familiar with te ao Māori. Teachers are increasing their use of te reo Māori within the programme. Leaders and ERO agree that this should continue to be an area for development.</p><p>Teachers have positive, responsive relationships with children. Developing learners' thinking, independence and social competence is a focus. A range of strategies to extend children's learning through their self-chosen play is evident.</p><p>The programme for infants and toddlers fosters unhurried play and follows their natural rhythms. A range of natural and exploratory resources is easily accessible for them. Teachers are responsive to children's verbal and non-verbal language cues. Routines and care times are used as opportunities for learning.</p><p>Learning partnerships with families are in place. Many parents are actively involved in aspects of the programme. Good communication keeps them informed of children's participation and development. Their aspirations are sought and used as a basis for children's goals.</p><p>Group planning aligns well with Little Schools' philosophy and is linked to individuals' goals and interests. Teachers identify intentional teaching strategies to progress these learning goals. Evaluation of the programme is beginning to be more clearly focused on outcomes for children. Assessment for individual children identifies emerging friendships and aspects of communication. Teachers should continue to strengthen in learning records:</p><ul>
<li>acknowledgement of children's progress over time</li>
<li>reflection of children's individual culture, language and identity</li>
<li>identification of relevant, specific next steps for children's learning.</li>
</ul><p>Review is well understood. Teachers are developing their use of internal evaluation within a wellstructured framework. An increased focus on the use of research and best practice to strengthen decision making is a key next step.</p><p>The head teachers work collaboratively to promote a positive team culture. They identify and provide opportunities for teachers to lead aspects of the programme.</p><p>Good support is available for leaders and teachers to develop their practice. Professional learning is valued and suited to their needs and ongoing development. The head teachers seek ways to build teacher knowledge and practice. However, appraisal requires strengthening. The process should be revised so all aspects of the Education Council's expectations are implemented, and to ensure the process better supports teachers' and leaders' development.</p><p>A strong policy framework guides centre operation. Managers are currently working to document and align systems and processes to promote consistency across the Little School organisation. Better monitoring of the quality of their implementation should also support this aim. While the strategic plan identifies business priorities, further consideration should be given to creating strategic goals that are linked to positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, managers and leaders agree that priorities at centre level are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>use of te reo Māori</li>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation in relation to individual children's learning.</li>
</ul><p>At governance level, priorities are to develop:</p><ul>
<li>a revised philosophy</li>
<li>understanding and use of internal evaluation at all levels</li>
<li>the teacher appraisal process</li>
<li>strategic planning that promotes outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, teachers and management of Kelburn Little School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice, and ensure endorsement of teachers' practising certificates meets a reliable and consistent standard, the service provider must ensure that all teachers are formally appraised annually, and all Education Council requirements are met.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kelburn Little School will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>10 July 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
