</table><p>Wharerangi Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wharerangi Kindergarten provides early childhood education and care for up to 41 children aged over two years. The current roll is 41, including five Māori children. All teachers are fully qualified.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises 'the value of learning through play within a calm, engaging and colourful community and supported by nurturing and passionate teachers'.</p><p>Wharerangi Kindergarten is one of 16 kindergartens operating under the governance and management of the Napier Kindergarten Association (the association). The governing board is responsible for setting the overall strategic direction for the organisation. The day-to-day operation of the association is the role of the general manager. Two education managers provide teaching and learning support for teachers. The board employs a Pou Whakarewa Mātauranga (Professional Practice Advisor Māori) to work alongside all association personnel to continue to strengthen cultural responsiveness.</p><p>The key next steps identified in the April 2016 ERO evaluation have been progressed and continue to be areas for the kindergarten to strengthen.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 16 kindergartens in the Napier Kindergarten Association.</p><p>The kindergarten is a member of the Ahuriri Kāhui Ako.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children largely lead their own learning through a curriculum that is purposefully designed to respond to their interests and strengths. Resources and the environment are organised to invite exploration. Imaginative play and literacy are highly visible in the programme. Children demonstrate confidence and independence and have fun.</p><p>A calm, predictable environment promotes children's sense of security. They benefit from positive, sensitive and responsive relationships with teachers. Tuakana teina relationships are evident. Children play well alongside others and support each other in their learning for sustained periods of time.</p><p>The bicultural curriculum continues to strengthen. Teachers are actively building their knowledge of te ao Māori and seek ways to integrate this across all aspects of the curriculum. They have identified that furthering their understanding of strategies that promote educational success for Māori children is a next step. ERO's evaluation confirms this.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are supported to engage in learning within an inclusive environment. Teachers actively work with schools and parents to create a positive transition process for these children.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning, results in a programme that promotes continuity and the kindergarten's philosophy. A collaborative approach to planning draws on the strengths of individual teachers. Parent goals for their children are used to inform learning opportunities. Teachers continue to explore and strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation practices. This ongoing focus should support consistency across the team in identifying relevant learning for each individual and planning of intentional teaching to progress this.</p><p>Since the previous ERO evaluation, teachers have developed their knowledge of effective internal evaluation for improvement. They are currently implementing and refining this practice. Education managers should continue to grow their own knowledge and practice of internal evaluation to better support this process.</p><p>The governing board is future-focused and has developed a clear strategic direction to meet the diverse needs of its communities. Board members value diversity of viewpoints and gather community and employee voice to inform decision-making. Regular reporting by the education managers is useful in identifying how strategic teaching and learning goals are being addressed.</p><p>The board places importance on developing teachers' capabilities. Targeted and deliberate building of cultural responsiveness supports Māori children and their whānau to experience success. An association-wide appraisal process is in place to support teacher practice in promoting positive learning outcomes for children. Further strengthening of the appraisal process, including targeted observations, should assist teachers to determine how well they are progressing and actively encourage them to improve their effectiveness.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that teachers should continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>practices that promote success for Māori children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation to progress individual learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation for improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Education managers should continue to promote sustained improvement and innovation through strengthening:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>evaluation, inquiry and professional guidance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the appraisal process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>Education managers should strengthen their understanding and use of internal evaluation to systematically evaluate their practices and the impact of these on outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wharerangi Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>24 October 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
