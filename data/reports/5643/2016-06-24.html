</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Karori Kindergarten is situated in Wellington. It provides early childhood education and care for up to 30 children aged over two years. The current roll is 58, including five Māori children.</p><p>Since the January 2012 ERO report, there have been some changes to the teaching team. A new teacher joined the staff in 2016.</p><p>The Kindergarten is one of 85 kindergartens and three home-based education and care networks governed and managed by He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). This is a new kindergarten association created from joining the Rimutaka and Wellington Kindergarten Associations in 2014.</p><p>The board and managers provide governance for the organisation. Senior teachers have delegated kindergartens. Their role is to provide regular support and a range of professional learning and development opportunities for teachers.</p><p>In 2012, the association developed a framework to guide the implementation of its curriculum, Te Manawa. This document outlines criteria for curriculum delivery including expectations for assessment and planning for children’s learning.</p><p>The previous ERO report for Karori Kindergarten identified a next step in relation to using self review to evaluate the programme. Teachers have strengthened their knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation and are working to embed this into their practice.</p><p>Areas where the association could strengthen its support for teachers were also identified, and positive progress has occurred. The alignment of individual kindergartens’ annual plans with the association’s strategic priorities has now been appropriately addressed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten philosophy is highly evident in practice. Children are learning to be independent, solve problems and support the learning of their friends. They participate enthusiastically in a programme that responds to their diverse cultural backgrounds.</p><p>Children and whānau are warmly welcomed into the kindergarten in a calm, unhurried manner. They are supported to settle at their own pace. A useful range of strategies supports older children and their families as they prepare for their move to school.</p><p>Teachers' responsiveness to children's wellbeing and individual needs is highly evident. They work collaboratively with parents and whānau to support children's progress in learning.</p><p>There is growing commitment by teachers to the use of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori. This is evident in the assessment of children's learning and in kindergarten routines. Their use of <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em> is increasingly strengthening practice in supporting educational success for Māori children.</p><p>Children's emerging interests are effectively used to extend their learning. Improving assessment practices has been a focus for teachers, and progress is evident in children's learning stories. ERO affirms the need to continue to strengthen assessment practices identified by the senior teacher and agreed to by teachers.</p><p>Teachers' knowledge of internal evaluation continues to grow and has led to positive change. A recent action research project has been useful in promoting a systematic approach to the process. Teachers should continue to embed this method.</p><p>The senior teacher provides termly written feedback that outlines agreed development priorities and progress in relation to the quality of teaching and learning. She completes an annual internal evaluation that supports strengthening of these termly reports. There is a deliberate focus on outcomes for children and teacher/leader performance. This has been successful in promoting improved practices in the kindergarten.</p><p>Increased opportunities for leadership within the kindergarten are emerging. The head teacher is encouraging teachers to share their strengths and to lead aspects of the programme.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report identified that the association needed to improve the appraisal processes. Managers undertook an internal review of the appraisal system. The revised model is being implemented across the kindergartens. The process includes focused goals that build teacher and leader capability and clearer links with the Practising Teacher Criteria. Staff at Karori Kindergarten are in the early stages of implementing the revised appraisal approach. This should be a development priority so that teachers continue to be well supported to grow their professional practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher, head teacher, staff and ERO agree on the following key next steps for Karori Kindergarten to continue:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing and embedding internal evaluation practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to prioritise the implementation of the revised appraisal process.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association should continue to support the development of formal critique of teaching practice and strengthening of responsiveness to Māori children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Karori Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Karori Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>24 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
