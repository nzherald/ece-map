</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Star Montessori House of Children is a well-established service in West Harbour. Licensed for 45 children aged two to six years, the centre provides full day learning programmes in purpose built facilities. The community attending the centre is predominately Chinese, Pākehā, and increasing numbers of families from other ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>The centre’s Montessori philosophy, vision and <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum inform the programme and guide teaching practice. Centre goals include offering children a programme where they can thrive as socially competent, independent thinkers and develop a lifelong love of learning.</p><p>The centre is staffed with an onsite owner/manager and experienced teachers. Most teachers have additional Montessori qualifications. The centre owner and teachers continue to focus on maintaining positive relationships and learning partnerships with families.</p><p>The centre has a history of positive ERO reports. Since the last review the centre has enhanced the outdoor learning environment to further support the centre's philosophy and positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the attractive and inviting centre. Well planned and managed arrival routines help children to develop independence. Children make choices, access play equipment and settle quickly into self-directed exploration, learning activities and play.</p><p>Children play and learn in mixed age groups at their own pace in a calm, and supportive learning environment. Children engage well in the programme. They benefit from extended periods of uninterrupted play that enable them to develop and sustain their interests. Teachers support children to be capable, confident and articulate learners. Teachers respond well to children's interests. They use skilful questioning and rich conversations to extend children's thinking and vocabulary.</p><p>Teachers plan and provide well-prepared Montessori resources, activities and provocations to specifically meet children's development stages and learning needs. They affirm and build on the strengths children bring, and model the Montessori philosophy in their practice.</p><p>Teachers are culturally responsive and they acknowledge and affirm children’s cultural backgrounds. Children have many opportunities to hear and use home languages as they learn English. Teachers use te reo Māori in waiata and in learning programmes. Leaders and teachers plan to continue to build their knowledge and capability in te reo and tikanga Māori, so children can benefit from a strong bicultural curriculum.</p><p>Consistency of care and learning is evident throughout the centre. Transitions into the centre and onto school are very well planned and managed. Leaders and teachers encourage families to take an active role in their children's learning. They develop inclusive relationships and learning partnerships with families. They work collaboratively with parents and other agencies to support children who have additional learning needs. Parents are provided with very good information about the curriculum and their children's progress. Children’s assessment portfolios are highly valued records of learning.</p><p>The centre is very effectively led and managed. Rigorous performance management practices and strong professional leadership enable the centre to maintain its focus on providing high quality early childhood education and care. The centre places emphasis on developing teachers as leaders, and on the continued professional development of staff. Professional learning for teachers positively influences teaching practice and enhances learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Highly effective management systems and regularly reviewed policies guide centre operations. There is a strong focus on continuous improvement. Leaders and teachers are reflective practitioners and continually improve their practice to support children's learning. Internal evaluation and self-review processes are strong. These processes are an integral part of the centre, and continue to strengthen teaching practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have identified relevant next steps that include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen bicultural practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further developing teachers' leadership capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating how well the new outdoor environment provides challenge in children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Star Montessori House Of Children completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Star Montessori House Of Children will be in four years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>16 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
