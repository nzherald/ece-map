<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The service is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The Montessori Infants&rsquo; House is one of three Kidicorp centres known as Montessori @ the Gardens. They are based on adjacent sites. The on-site manager has responsibility for all three licences. In the last 12 months a new teaching team has been working in the Infants&rsquo; House. The head teacher is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the centre.</p><p>The Infants&rsquo; House provides all-day education and care for toddlers under three years. They come from many parts of Dunedin and from diverse backgrounds. Teachers use effective processes to create a sense of belonging for the children and their wh&#257;nau.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2010, teachers have maintained their focus on providing an education based soundly on the Montessori principles. The teachers are committed to teaching through this philosophy. Significant improvements have been made to the outdoor environment and the children&rsquo;s learning stories. In 2010, ERO identified the need for the centre to extend its self-review processes. This continues to be an area for development.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in three early childhood education services within the Kidicorp Ltd umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The toddlers work and learn in a calm and settled classroom. They show a strong sense of purpose and ownership. They make very good use of the resources.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy is soundly based on the principles of Montessori and is well linked to Te Whaariki (the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum). The principles of independence, social skill development and respect are very visible throughout the programme and in how the toddlers interact with each other and their environment.</p><p>Teachers establish and maintain meaningful relationships with the toddlers and their wh&#257;nau. Teachers often seek ideas from parents and ask them about their aspirations for their children. As a teaching team, they consider these, along with the Montessori learning sequences, when deciding the learning and teaching directions for individual children.</p><p>Throughout their day at Infants&rsquo; House, the toddlers hear and use te reo M&#257;ori in waiata, stories, rhymes and instructions. The learning environment and many of the teachers&rsquo; practices are building children&rsquo;s awareness of te ao M&#257;ori.</p><p>Teachers reflect on their practices as individuals and as a team. They work collaboratively to plan for children&rsquo;s learning and the overall organisation of the classroom&rsquo;s programme. Over the past months, teachers across the three classrooms have been sharing ideas and resources more.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers and teachers could improve their self review by:</p><ul>
<li>developing a shared understanding of sound self-review</li>
<li>establishing consistent processes that clearly set out what is to be reviewed, who is involved and how information will be gathered and analysed, recorded, used and evaluated to bring about further improvements for children</li>
<li>establishing a review cycle to ensure all aspects of the operations of the service are effectively reviewed over time.</li>
</ul><p>The centre manager, with the head teachers, should clarify, document and implement their expectations for effective planning, assessment and evaluation. Consistent centre-wide expectations would provide better support for:</p><ul>
<li>teachers to know what they have to do</li>
<li>managers to monitor the quality of planning across the three classrooms</li>
<li>teachers and managers when reviewing aspects of their work.</li>
</ul><p>Managers need to establish procedures to ensure the Kidicorp systems are better implemented. These should include:</p><ul>
<li>the centre manager and head teachers making more effective use of the comprehensive and regular external reports and audits provided by the business and professional services managers</li>
<li>teachers having an annual robust appraisal, with links to ongoing and relevant professional support that assists them to continue to develop their teaching practices.</li>
</ul><p>Centre managers need to ensure all staff have regular opportunities to share their ideas and views, for example, about the effectiveness of management practices including performance management.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Montessori Infants' House completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>Curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, managers and teachers should be more rigorous when carrying out and recording evacuation drills.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>20 June 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
