</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mountain View Preschool Limited is located in Rotorua, adjacent to Western Heights Primary School. It provides all-day education and care for children from birth to school age. The centre is licensed for up to 42 children, including 15 up to two years of age. At the time of this ERO review, 42 children were enrolled, 30 of whom are identified as being of Māori descent. The centre, previously known as R.E.A.L Kids Preschool, was purchased by Provincial Childcare Holdings in November 2013. It is one of three centres in Rotorua, owned and operated by this private childcare company.</p><p>ERO’s previous review in March 2013 identified the need for many aspects of centre operations to be improved. These included professional leadership, staff appraisal, self review, resourcing, learning environments, assessment, planning, evaluation, and teaching practices. Since purchasing the centre, the new owners and local management rōpu have undertaken significant review of centre operations and practices. There have been considerable staff changes, including leadership positions. In addition there has been immediate upgrading of the environment for children under two years of age, and equipment and resources for all age groups. At the time of this review, the area for children over 2 was being significantly upgraded. There has been steady roll growth, with many new children and families joining the centre community.</p><p>The centre philosophy celebrates diversity through practices that are inclusive. It recognises the potential of all children, as well as the skills, knowledge and abilities they already have, and endeavours to protect the mana of each child.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre owners and the local management rōpu have high expectations for developing effective education and care for children and families. Since November 2013, continual review has resulted in many positive changes for children. These include improved routines, nutrition, health and safety, and positive guidance. The management rōpu contributes a range of highly relevant and complementary knowledge and skills to the centre.</p><p>The centre philosophy is underpinned by the principles inherent in Te Tiriti o Waitangi. It has a strong focus on children’s holistic development and maintaining reciprocal partnerships with parents. Centre owners are committed to ensuring that barriers to participation and attendance are minimised for children and families.</p><p>Management and centre leaders have made solid progress in a very short time towards developing a positive and collaborative team culture. There is a strong focus on shared responsibility and valuing the contribution that staff and parents make with decisions that enhance outcomes for children. Teachers have benefited from the planned approach to developing expected practices. This has involved employing staff with recognised strengths, deliberate role modelling, mentoring, and providing constructive feedback to teachers about their practice. There is an effective appraisal process that informs planned professional learning and development for teachers.</p><p>The centre’s curriculum prioritises children’s development of social awareness, competence and confidence, and dispositions for life-long learning. The uniqueness of each person, their culture, background and ability is celebrated. There is a strong emphasis on providing a bicultural curriculum that fosters links and connections with local people and places of significance to Māori. Recent upgrades have enhanced teaching and learning environments and equipment for children and staff.</p><p>Whanaungatanga and manaakitanga are evident through teachers’ affirming and responsive interactions with children and families. Many teachers demonstrate confidence to integrate conversational te reo Māori. This provides good modelling for children and encouragement for staff who are less confident users of the language.</p><p>Teachers implement effective strategies that empower children to lead their play and learning. Children enjoy teacher-led experiences designed to challenge thinking and extend interests. There is a focus on providing positive guidance that fosters children’s confidence and social skills. Teachers value parents as the first teachers of their children and respond flexibly to their ideas and wishes. Learning is becoming increasingly visible to parents and children through assessment profiles and planning displays.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are very well nurtured and cared for. Teachers value each child as a capable communicator and explorer. Interactions are respectful and responsive to the personal routines, interests and abilities of each child. Teachers foster tuakana/teina relationships that encourage communication and learning with older peers and whānau members. There is strong evidence of collaborative planning with parents to ensure positive outcomes for children up to 2 years of age. Teachers confidently model language in both te reo Māori and English, that is well understood by children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre management has identified, and ERO strongly agrees that the following next steps are important for the ongoing development of the service:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to develop expected teaching practices and learning environments</li>
<li>sustaining community partnerships</li>
<li>providing opportunities for children to develop literacy, mathematics and investigation skills in the context of their play.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mountain View Preschool Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mountain View Preschool Limited will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>10 April 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
