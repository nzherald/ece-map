</table><a id="2-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left"><span>Meadowbank Kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association</span> <span>and is supported through the organisation&rsquo;s professional systems and practices. The relationship between the kindergarten and the wider community is positive and ongoing. Teachers and parents are committed to and involved in the kindergarten&rsquo;s community-minded learning experiences. Parents and teachers actively maintain a partnership that supports the development of children&rsquo;s learning.</span></p><p align="left"><span>The kindergarten&rsquo;s families recognise and acknowledge the tradition</span><span>s that have been established and many families have a long association with the kindergarten. Parents are keen to share their skills, which include supporting the programme with cultural experiences and celebrations.</span></p><p align="left"><span>Children have a strong sense of belonging</span> <span>in the centre. They are happy and comfortable about expressing themselves and developing their imaginative play ideas within the kindergarten&rsquo;s inclusive and safe environment. They are responsive to learning experiences offered and to opportunities to explore different types of play activities. Children are confident and skilled at responding to teachers&rsquo; use of greetings and phrases in different languages. Parents enjoy contributing to the family/wh</span><span>&#257;</span><span>nau displays by providing photos and information about events and celebrations they value. Developments in the outdoor area have further enhanced the high quality provision of equipment, resources and experiences for the children.</span></p><p align="left"><span>Teachers</span> <span>work well together as a team and provide children with interesting, enjoyable and purposeful learning experiences. They are caring and supportive towards children, encouraging their participation and co-operation through their own active involvement and the use of positive guidance strategies. There is ongoing provision for recognising and acknowledging cultural traditions, values and languages. The welcoming and inclusive culture supports the development of wh</span><span>a</span><span>naungatanga and the achievement of the aspirations of wh</span><span>&#257;</span><span>nau for their children. Teachers make effective use of self review to enhance their teaching and learning practices.</span></p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left"><span>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</span></p><a id="3-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left"><span>Before the review, the management of Meadowbank Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</span></p><p align="left"><span>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at</span> <span>Meadowbank Kindergarten.</span></p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left"><span>Teachers are focused on noticing and responding to children&rsquo;s interests and</span> <span>have a consistent and purposeful approach to teaching and learning. Managers and teachers have responded well to the recommendations of ERO&rsquo;s 2006 report in relation to curriculum management development, strengthening self review and professional development. The successful outcomes of self review are evident and systems for planning, evaluation, and monitoring assessments are well established. Teachers place priority on continued reflection and evaluation of their teaching approaches and value the appraisal system as a means of further developing and improving their professional practice.</span></p><p align="left"><span>Improvements</span> <span>in the kindergarten&rsquo;s environment have provided further learning opportunities and have extended areas available for play. Teachers, children and parents have been involved in developing a vegetable garden that is based on ecological sustainability from a M</span><span>&#257;</span><span>ori perspective. The produce from this garden is used in cooking with the children. Engagement in the process of developing the garden has enhanced children&rsquo;s knowledge about the benefits of their own home-grown food.</span></p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><p align="left"><em>Engagement in play activities.</em> <span>Interesting play activities support children&rsquo;s engagement in learning. The provision of a variety of equipment and resources encourages children to explore and co-operate together while being involved in different types of sustained learning experiences. Teachers enjoy developing and enhancing children&rsquo;s interests and language opportunities by joining in their play activities. Children are also happy to play independently, in pairs and groups and confidently include others in their games.</span></p><p align="left"><em>Culturally inclusive</em><span>. There has been a well considered response to ERO&rsquo;s recommendation in 2006 that teachers plan for, use, and encourage children&rsquo;s home languages. Importance is now placed on children participating in culturally inclusive learning experiences. Children&rsquo;s cultural backgrounds and home languages are valued, recognised and incorporated into the programme. Teachers have strengthened their use of different languages with children and are teaching children a variety of dances and songs from other cultures.</span></p><p align="left"><em>Effective use of the environment</em><span>. Teachers make effective use of the environment by setting up interesting and engaging resources that are linked to children&rsquo;s interests. Children make good use of the indoor and outdoor space and are confident to participate in a range of different play experiences. Games, floor puzzles and science resources are a regular feature of children&rsquo;s play choices and independent exploration. The kindergarten environment supports children to grow as capable and confident learners.</span></p><p align="left"><em>Collaborative teaching staff</em><span><em>.</em> Teachers collaborate well to provide a supportive, caring and responsive culture. Children trust and value their teachers and are happy to talk with them about their interests and experiences. Teachers regularly reflect on and discuss what they are noticing about children&rsquo;s play activities in order to respond effectively. They are focused on building and developing more opportunities for children to enjoy high quality learning experiences.</span></p><p align="left"><em>Provision for literacy</em><span><em>.</em> Provision of a wide range of literacy resources is a feature of the kindergarten programme. Children use a variety of tools for writing through their play and have good access to different types of reading texts. These include teachers&rsquo; stories about their own celebrations, books with New Zealand themes, and scrapbooks that relate to different events and activities in which the children have been involved. These provisions support the development of children&rsquo;s early literacy knowledge.</span></p><p align="left"><em>Children accessing portfolios</em><span><em>.</em> Portfolios are easily accessible for children to read. Groups of children enjoy sitting together and sharing the learning activities they have participated in. These discussions enable children to develop their social skills and the use of complex language as they explain their thoughts to each other and talk about the experiences they have been involved in.</span></p><p align="left"><em>Information and communication technologies (ICT)</em><span>. Children are confident users of ICT programmes and enjoy exploring these learning opportunities. They are able to talk about what they are doing and can describe the purpose of the activity. Children work together in pairs and small groups at the computer to discuss and try out different ways of completing tasks.</span></p><h4>Areas for improvement</h4><p align="left"><em>Planning displays</em><span>. Currently, the approach for displaying planning is to share ongoing and detailed learning that evolves over a long period of time. Refining the information that is presented, with the added inclusion of artwork and learning stories, should provide parents and children with more meaningful and current information and should result in an interesting, high impact, and visually stimulating presentation.</span></p><p align="left"><em>Portfolios</em><span><em>.</em> Teachers should maintain a balance of individual and group stories in assessment portfolios and should monitor the ways in which the parent voice is included in these records. Records of children&rsquo;s individual learning experiences provide parents with meaningful information and give them opportunities to make comments that express and support their specific aspirations for their child.</span></p><a id="4-areas-of-national-interest" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Areas of National Interest</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>M&#257;ori Children</h3><p align="left"><span>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which this service carries out a process to identify and respond to the aspirations and expectations of the parents and wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children and focuses on the potential of M&#257;ori childre</span><span>n to develop as competent and capable learners. In this kindergarten one child has M</span><span>&#257;</span><span>ori heritage.</span></p><h3>Areas of good performance</h3><p align="left"><em>Vision and strategic planning.</em> <span>New Zealand&rsquo;s dual heritage and respect for the Treaty of Waitangi are reflected in the kindergarten&rsquo;s vision and strategic planning</span><span>.</span> <span>Teachers have specifically included a bicultural focus in their documentation, teaching practices, and in the environment. Targeted professional development is supporting the kindergarten&rsquo;s aim of developing sustainable practices that are culturally appropriate.</span></p><p align="left"><em>Parental aspirations</em><span>. When they enrol their children in the centre, parents/wh</span><span>&#257;</span><span>nau share information that enables teachers to identify the specific expectations and aspirations that parents/wh</span><span>&#257;</span><span>nau have for their children. This information is held in individual portfolios, which are readily accessible. Parents/wh</span><span>&#257;</span><span>nau report that they enjoy reading about their children&rsquo;s learning experiences and achievements. Children frequently sit and look at their portfolios, share them with their friends and talk about what they have been doing.</span></p><p align="left"><em>Partnership for learning</em><span><em>.</em> Parents/wh</span><span>&#257;</span><span>nau are encouraged to become involved and participate in the programme. Visiting the kindergarten before enrolling and remaining with their child on the first day are strategies that support children to settle more easily and help to give them a sense of belonging in the centre. The programme recognises and builds on children&rsquo;s strengths and interests. Teachers form reciprocal relationships with parents/wh</span><span>&#257;</span><span>nau and value the cultural richness and experiences that parents/wh</span><span>&#257;</span><span>nau can share with all children.</span></p><p align="left"><em>Connections with the local marae</em><span><em>.</em> Teachers, families/wh</span><span>&#257;</span><span>nau and children value the centre&rsquo;s connections with the local marae. Visits to the marae have led to the children learning marae protocols, being involved in p&#333;whiri and singing waiata. Teachers and families have participated in tree-planting projects. These experiences have supported children&rsquo;s understanding of traditional ceremonies and of the need to care for the environment.</span></p><p align="left"><em>Inclusive culture</em><span>. Celebration of cultural events, such as Matariki, learning waiata, and responding to teachers using phrases in te reo M</span><span>&#257;</span><span>ori, are a regular feature of the learning programme. Children experience the Tiriti o Waitangi by participating in the development of their own kindergarten treaty. Opportunities for families/wh</span><span>&#257;</span><span>nau to share stories about their cultural backgrounds and home languages provide children with more ways to feel included. Teachers recognise the significance of providing a culturally inclusive environment to support children&rsquo;s sense of belonging.</span></p><p align="left"><em>Shared understanding</em><span><em>.</em> Teachers participate together in purposeful professional development to develop their shared understanding of appropriate provision for teaching tikanga M</span><span>&#257;</span><span>ori. Discussions at staff meetings are also focused on sharing and learning t</span><span>&#275;</span><span>reo M</span><span>&#257;</span><span>ori phrases to support the development of teachers&rsquo; knowledge, skills and confidence in using t</span><span>e</span><span>reo M</span><span>&#257;</span><span>ori with children.</span></p><a id="5-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3><span>Overview</span></h3><p align="left"><span>Before the review, the licensee and staff of Meadowbank Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO</em></span><em> Centre&nbsp;Management Assurance Statement and&nbsp;Self-Audit Checklist</em><span>.

<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management;</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s investigations did not identify any areas of concern.</p><a id="6-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6. Recommendations</h2><p align="left"><span>ERO and teachers</span> <span>agreed that:</span></p><ol>
<li>
<p align="left"><span>teachers</span> <span>should continue to engage in self review to enhance their high quality practice.</span></p>

The relationship between the kindergarten and the wider community</span> <span>is positive and ongoing. Teachers and parents are committed to and involved in the kindergarten&rsquo;s community-minded learning experiences. Parents and teachers actively maintain a partnership that supports the development of children&rsquo;s learning.</span></p><p align="left">The kindergarten&rsquo;s families recognise and acknowledge the traditions that have been established and many families have a long association with the kindergarten. Parents are keen to share their skills, which include supporting the programme with cultural experiences and celebrations.</p><p align="left"><span>Children have a strong sense of belonging in the centre. They are happy and comfortable about expressing themselves and developing their imaginative play ideas within the kindergarten&rsquo;s inclusive and safe environment. They are responsive to learning experiences offered and to opportunities to explore different types of play activities. Children are confident and skilled at responding to teachers&rsquo; use of greetings and phrases in different languages. Parents enjoy contributing to the family/wh</span><span>&#257;</span><span>nau displays by providing photos and information about events and celebrations they value. Developments in the outdoor area have further enhanced the high quality provision of equipment, resources and experiences for the children.</span></p><p align="left"><span>Teachers work well together as a team and provide children with interesting, enjoyable and purposeful learning experiences. They are caring and supportive towards children, encouraging their participation and co-operation through their own active involvement and the use of positive guidance strategies. There is ongoing provision for recognising and acknowledging cultural traditions, values and languages. The welcoming and inclusive culture supports the development of wh</span><span>a</span><span>naungatanga and the achievement of the aspirations of wh</span><span>&#257;</span><span>nau for their children. Teachers make effective use of self review to enhance their teaching and learning practices.</span></p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left"><span>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</span></p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or licensee if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left"><span>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span><a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/">http://www.ero.govt.nz</a>.</span></span></p><p align="left">Dr Graham Stoop</p><p align="left">Chief Review Officer</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information About Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Areas of National Interest</b> &ndash; information about how Government policies are working in early childhood centres.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
