<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mathers Road is located in the Hoon Hay suburb of Christchurch. This kindergarten operates on a sessional basis to provide care and education for 45 children over the age of two years. All teachers are fully qualified and registered.</p><p align="left">It is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">Positive features of this kindergarten are:</p><ul>
<li>the welcoming and inclusive environment</li>
<li>effective teaching practices</li>
<li>well organised and resourced physical environment.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Teachers encourage sustainable practices in much of the programme planning and this is reflected clearly in the environment. They have successfully participated in a programme to support children and their families understand healthy living.</p><p align="left">The next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>review and further develop assessment and programme planning practices</li>
<li>investigate ways to make greater use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in learning programmes.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The association is well organised and managed. It provides clear policies and procedures, a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education services managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development.</p><p align="left">This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association has been proactive in addressing these issues.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the kindergarten is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mathers Road was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mathers Road.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The kindergarten&rsquo;s vision is to provide a warm welcoming atmosphere where the community is involved with children&rsquo;s learning in a variety of ways. They aim to provide a safe, secure and inclusive learning environment with high levels of respect for all. Children are encouraged to become confident, competent lifelong learners.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4>Relationships</h4><p align="left">Teachers build good relationships across the kindergarten through knowing the children and their families well. Children, teachers and parents all contribute to the inclusive and welcoming environment. Children and families demonstrate a strong sense of belonging. ERO observed children playing cooperatively together for sustained periods of time. They enjoy each other&rsquo;s company and effectively communicate to encourage learning and problem solving.</p><p align="left">Teachers have established meaningful links to the local schools and wider community groups.</p><h4>Teaching strategies</h4><p align="left">Teachers use an effective range of strategies to guide and support children&rsquo;s learning and well-being. ERO observed interactions where teachers extended children&rsquo;s ideas and thinking. They use empowering questions to prompt children&rsquo;s curiosity and problem solving. Teachers regularly reflect on children&rsquo;s learning progress.</p><p align="left">Teachers plan programmes that are responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and learning needs. They seek the input of children and their families into programme planning. Children are provided with a wide range of learning opportunities. They are encouraged to make choices and take responsibility for their learning and behaviour. Children understand routines and willingly take part in free choice activities. Teachers should now review formal group times to ensure all children&rsquo;s learning needs are met.</p><h4>Environment</h4><p align="left">Children learn and play in a well resourced and organised environment. They have easy access to all resources throughout the day. Children confidently use and share the resources. Teachers have reviewed indoor areas to encourage children&rsquo;s access to wall displays. They are currently reviewing the outdoor environment to provide further challenges for children.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><h4>Assessment</h4><p align="left">Teachers regularly assess children&rsquo;s learning through individual and group stories. However, links to the next steps for learning and links between stories are not always clear. Teachers should now review assessment and planning practices to make these links more explicit.</p><p align="left">Since the 2007 ERO review, teachers are making programme planning more accessible for parents. Their next step is to make this planning more visible within the kindergarten environment.</p><p align="left"><b>Information and Communication Technology (ICT).</b></p><p align="left">Teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that they need to consider ways to include more ICT within the learning programme. Children would benefit from opportunities to use a greater range of ICT in their learning and play.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long-term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h4>Partnerships with Wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori Children in Early Childhood Services</h4><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><p align="left">this kindergarten understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the kindergarten;</p><ul>
<li>managers and teachers have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children;</li>
<li>this kindergarten works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">There are 10 M&#257;ori children attending this kindergarten whose parents/wh&#257;nau have identified them as M&#257;ori. M&#257;ori children experience an environment that respects their culture and gives a sense of belonging.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p align="left">Teachers value and are committed to M&#257;ori language and culture. M&#257;ori children experience an environment that respects their culture and gives them a sense of belonging. ERO observed:</p><ul>
<li>natural and regular use of te reo M&#257;ori by teachers, children and parents</li>
<li>integrated bicultural practices</li>
<li>visibility of tikanga within the environment and programme</li>
<li>the association&rsquo;s recent development of &lsquo;Kidsfirst Wh&#257;nau&rsquo; - a wh&#257;nau-based approach for involving and engaging parents in kindergarten life and their child&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mathers Road completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the kindergarten&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><a id="parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-mathers-road" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mathers Road</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mathers Road.</p><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mathers Road is located in the Hoon Hay suburb of Christchurch. This kindergarten operates on a sessional basis to provide care and education for 45 children over the age of two years. All teachers are fully qualified and registered.</p><p align="left">It is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p><p align="left">Positive features of this kindergarten are:</p><ul>
<li>the welcoming and inclusive environment</li>
<li>effective teaching practices</li>
<li>well organised and resourced physical environment.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Teachers encourage sustainable practices in much of the programme planning and this is reflected clearly in the environment. They have successfully participated in a programme to support children and their families understand healthy living.</p><p align="left">The next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>review and further develop assessment and programme planning practices</li>
<li>investigate ways to make greater use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in learning programmes.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The association is well organised and managed. It provides clear policies and procedures, a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education services managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development.</p><p align="left">This review occurred at a time when the association and its kindergartens were responding to issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association has been proactive in addressing these issues.</p></html>
