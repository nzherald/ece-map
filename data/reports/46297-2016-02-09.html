</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Riverlee Early Learning Centre is a privately owned education and care centre located near Whitianga. It is licensed for 35 children including up to 10 under the age of two. Designated age-group areas include Nature’s Nest for children up to the age of three, Nature’s Kindy for children from three to six years old and Bush Kindy, which takes place on the land surrounding the centre. There are currently 54 children on the roll, of whom 15 are Māori. More than 80% of teachers have early childhood education qualifications. This is the centre’s first ERO report.</p>
<p>The centre opened in September 2013. It is a purpose built facility situated on a life-style block of land, which affords opportunities for children to enjoy supervised interactions with animals, and pursue exploration of trees and stream life. Designated teachers continually accompany small groups of children on farm visits. The centre building is designed to create a spacious home-like atmosphere, which is enhanced by extensive and interesting outdoor play areas for both age groups.</p>
<p>The centre philosophy has been developed collaboratively with staff and is supported by parents. It focuses on nature-based learning, creating a secure home away from home environment, positive relationships within the centre and local community, and values such as kindness, respect, trust and guardianship (kaitiakitanga). These beliefs and values are continually reflected throughout the programme.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children benefit from warm, respectful and reciprocal relationships with teachers who encourage them to be confident and capable learners. Interactions between teachers and children reflect the centre’s identified virtues of trust, love, care and respect. Children are active decision makers in their play and learning.</p>
<p>The high quality programme is based on children’s interests, patterns of play and their creative ideas. Teachers listen carefully and respond appropriately to children’s emerging interests.</p>
<p>They support and guide children to make positive choices and decisions about their learning and behaviour and model oral language very well to extend children’s thinking and vocabulary. Te reo Māori is evident at the level of each teacher’s knowledge and expertise. Teachers are beginning to explore local historical events of significance to both Māori and non-Māori in order to integrate this knowledge into the programme. Teachers ensure inclusion and support for children with diverse needs.</p>
<p>Nature-based learning is a key feature of the centre’s programme. High quality learning environments include extensive outdoor areas for both age groups, which are carefully landscaped to set the scene for discovery, exploration, physical challenge and social play within very spacious and creatively presented play areas. There is a wide range of multi-purpose, real-life, natural, recycled and open-ended resources that provoke children’s curiosity and imagination. Children have space to play and learn independently and in groups.</p>
<p>The centre’s home away from home philosophy is reflected in both indoor and outdoor environments and in the programme. Processes for baking, paper recycling and butter making are based on the seasons and provide children with real-life learning experiences. Literacy, numeracy and creative expression are integrated into these processes and within centre-wide learning through play. Flexible routines provide children with choices that enable them to express their preferences and sustain their play. Transitions to and within the centre, and to school, are sensitively managed to support the needs of children and their families.</p>
<p>Children demonstrate a strong interest in participating in the centre ‘Bush Kindy’ learning experiences. They may choose to spend up to a whole day in the surrounding bush or on the adjacent farm. They also engage in social play in these environments, which require resourcefulness and resilience in all weather.</p>
<p>Babies and toddlers play and learn in a high quality learning environment, which is spacious, home-like and comfortable for children, teachers and families. They benefit from a calm and unhurried atmosphere. Teachers are caring and nurturing. They respond readily to children's verbal and non-verbal cues and to their individual rhythms and needs. A sense of security and belonging is created within a family-like atmosphere, where home-like play materials are readily accessed. Continual communication with parents is valued and reciprocal. Parents are welcome to remain with their children in order to settle and develop trusting relationships with teachers.</p>
<p>Learning journals include attractive records of children’s individual learning and social participation in centre activities. There are clear expectations for assessment to identify children’s interests, inquiries, and patterns of play and to incorporate aspects of the centre’s philosophy.</p>
<p>Learning is also made visible in continual slide-shows, daily diaries and well-considered photographic displays. These enable children, teachers and parents to revisit and discuss learning experiences at the centre.</p>
<p>The centre manager is an effective professional leader. She has high expectations for developing a community of learners who share her vision for the centre’s ongoing development and works alongside her team to model best practice in early childhood education and care. Teachers work collaboratively to plan and teach in the best interests of the children. They are capable and reflective practitioners who embrace the centre’s particular focuses and feel empowered to participate in the leadership and management of the centre.</p>
<p>Strategic direction is set and regularly reviewed in collaboration with the teaching team. Professional development is provided in response to centre-wide needs, emerging trends in early childhood education, and regulatory requirements. Beginning teachers are well mentored and guided through the registration process. Self review of policies and centre-wide development ensures compliance and supports continuous improvement.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>ERO and the centre manager agree that key next steps are to continue to:</p>
<ul><li>develop assessment practices to include recognition of children’s learning and development over time</li>
<li>further incorporate bicultural perspectives along with literacy and mathematics learning</li>
<li>strengthen teachers’ confidence, knowledge and skill in integrating te reo Māori within the programme</li>
<li>develop strategic and annual planning and self review processes</li>
<li>implement the recently developed appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Riverlee Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Riverlee Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p>
<h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
