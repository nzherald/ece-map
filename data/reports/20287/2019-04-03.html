</table><p>Freyberg Community Pre-School is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Freyberg Community Pre-School is a well-established service that operates on the grounds of Freyberg Community School. It is licensed to provide education and care for 30 children aged over two years. The centre continues to be staffed by the same teaching team of four qualified teachers. It is governed by a committee of parents and community members who, over recent years, have supported the centre's refurbishment. Most children are Pākehā with several other smaller ethnic groups of children, including Pacific and Māori.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report noted the good provision of care and education, and teachers' commitment to developing a bicultural curriculum. These aspects, as well as positive relationships teachers had with children and families, have been maintained. Since the 2015 ERO review, teachers have enhanced their good practices by refining the appraisal processes, and supporting children to develop confidence in themselves as independent learners.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children form strong friendships and play cooperatively with their peers. They respond positively to the inclusive and responsive atmosphere of the centre. Children lead their learning. They collaborate and negotiate in decision making with teachers. Children choose their activities, and teachers engage them in conversation as they play. Interactions between teachers and children are friendly and encouraging, and contribute to children's learning.</p><p>The learning environment is richly resourced and interesting for children. Science resources have a special place. The environment offers opportunities for risk-taking, provocations and a variety of learning opportunities. It is an exciting space for children's exploration and play.</p><p>The preschool promotes bicultural practices to ensure Te Tiriti o Waitangi principles are recognised. Aotearoa's bicultural heritage is celebrated and woven through the preschool environment. Teachers are inclusive and responsive to the rich diversity of cultures in the preschool. They invite parents and whānau to share about their children's cultural identities. Teachers continue to look for ways to build knowledge from, and strengthen relationships with the local community.</p><p>Teachers listen to children and observe their play. They use this knowledge to plan learning for individual and groups of children, based on children's interests and strengths. Teachers plan meaningful opportunities to develop early literacy and numeracy skills through play. Teachers collate information about children's learning and participation in preschool activities in individual portfolios and online to share with parents.</p><p>The preschool has positive transition to school practices. Teachers have a close relationship with the local school. They work to familiarise children and parents with their next steps in children's educational journey.</p><p>Teachers' practices and the environment reflect the principles and strands of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers have shared ownership of the philosophy, and are inspired by Reggio Emilia and current learning theorists.</p><p>Parents express their appreciation of the teaching team, and feel a sense of belonging to the preschool. Teachers' reciprocal relationships with families are developing into learning-focused partnerships. Parents are well informed about their child's progress, and the activities in the preschool.</p><p>Managers and the governance committee support teachers very well in their professional development. This support has helped them to develop a clear vision, and to contribute to the priorities for the preschool. The refined appraisal process supports teachers' inquiries, which are aligned to the preschool's strategic direction and its robust improvement practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers and managers have identified relevant key next steps for the preschool's development that include strengthening learning-focused partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Freyberg Community Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>3 April 2019</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
