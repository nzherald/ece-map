</table><p>With significant support from Barnardos KidStart Childcare management, this service should be well placed to sustain and improve practice.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Eastbourne Early Learning Centre is one of 23 childcare centres owned and operated by Barnardos New Zealand, a national provider of community services for children and families. The centre is jointly owned by Barnardos and The Eastbourne Community Childcare Group, which is made up of parents whose children attend the centre. Property maintenance and generous support for resourcing results from this alliance. It is licensed for 25 children, including up to five children under two years. There are 32 children enrolled. The centre provides a choice of full day, six or four hour sessions.</p><p>The new head teacher took up her position at the beginning of 2016. The three permanent teachers are qualified and registered. The service is about to employ a fourth teacher. Since ERO's July 2013 review the service has experienced four changes of head teacher and other staff movement.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified the need to review and strengthen provision of care for infants and toddlers in a mixed age setting; improve the performance management system and provide staff with clear feedback and feedforward; and strengthen internal review through establishing clear indicators of quality to guide teachers’ practice and against which teachers could be evaluated. These areas continue to be the focus of ongoing development.</p><p>The new head teacher plans to lead review of the philosophy in the light of staff changes and to ensure that it reflects the values that underpin teaching and learning.</p><p>Day-to-day management of the centre is the responsibility of the head teacher. The regionally based practice leader supports curriculum. A newly appointed early learning manager oversees the operation of a cluster of Wellington centres, including this one. Responsibility for centre-based services is delegated to a national operations manager, who reports to a general manager and the Barnardos board through the Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>Since the 2012-2013 ERO reviews of Barnardos early learning centres, significant restructuring of the national organisation has been undertaken.</p><p>This review is one of a cluster of five reviews of Barnardos KidStart Childcare Learning Centres.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are caring and respectful in their interactions with children. For much of the day children control their play choices. The service is well-resourced with a good range of learning materials freely accessible.</p><p>The tone of the environment is homely, comforting and nurturing. At free play times children sustain their interest and engagement for long periods. They show trust in the environment and their teachers.</p><p>Children enjoy the opportunities and experiences offered. They are enthusiastic, friendly and confident. The outdoor area provides a range of challenging physical learning experiences.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well provided for in the mixed age environment. Key teachers work closely with them, promoting their wellbeing and communicating with parents. Younger children are happy and confident learners.</p><p>The key teacher approach is continuing to develop to be available to all children new to the service.</p><p>Teachers are working collaboratively to make planning more visible for parents. They endeavour to notice, recognise and respond to children’s learning and strengths, linked to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and developmental milestones.</p><p>Portfolios record children’s participation in the life of the centre and aspects of their learning. Best examples show some linked narratives, and revisiting of strong interests. Literacy, mathematics and science are integrated into the programme. These could be more evident in learning records.</p><p>The head teacher agrees that assessment requires development. Further work is needed by teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen the focus on individual children’s significant learning and show how teachers are extending children’s learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify and plan to meet parents’ aspirations for their children’s learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Consideration should be given to reviewing some of the routine-driven aspects of the programme to better reflect values and support children’s engagement in learning.</p><p>The quality of learning conversations varies. Examples of good quality conversations occur throughout the day.</p><p>A flexible and inclusive approach supports children’s transitions into the service, based on the child's and their family's needs. Next steps for assisting children’s transition to primary school should include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to develop ways of sharing information about children’s learning with new entrant teachers</li>
<li>better supporting older children in the early childhood programme to prepare them for school.</li>
</ul><p>Barnardos provides a range of carefully-considered operational and administrative support for the centre. This includes constructive visits and reports from the practice leader and quality assurance through the annual audit. Work is underway to strengthen the use of these tools for promoting improvements to teaching and learning. Understanding and use of internal evaluation continues to need development at centre and management level.</p><p>The appraisal process is not yet providing effective support for teacher development and endorsement of satisfactory performance in meeting professional teaching requirements. The Barnardos ‘Goals and Growth’ system should be fully implemented.</p><p>Strategic initiatives at management level have recently been identified to support improved outcomes under the new operational framework. While a strategic plan has recently been developed at centre level, this should be reviewed once new staff have settled into the service, as further work needs to be done to support understanding and embedding of Barnardos' operational changes. Guidelines and policies, whilst comprehensive, continue to need updating to reflect new ways of working.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Barnardos KidStart Childcare management will develop an action plan for ERO that shows how it will address the key next steps to improve teaching and learning across this cluster of services, including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing the quality of assessment, programme planning for learning, and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the bicultural curriculum and te ao Māori understanding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing improvement-focused appraisal for all staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening assessment for learning practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing the understanding and use of internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing transition to school processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gathering and responding to parent aspirations</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO will monitor the progress Barnardos KidStart Childcare managers make in relation to the action plan.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Eastbourne Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice Barnardos should ensure that appropriate hazard management practices are implemented, especially in relation to securing objects that may cause harm in the event of an earthquake.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Eastbourne Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>10 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
