</table><p>ABC St Albans is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC St Albans has had to cope with significant changes and challenges since the 2010 review, including moving into temporary accommodation after the Canterbury earthquakes. The centre is now relocated in a renovated homely villa. These challenges and changes have been well managed.</p><p>The centre provides care and education for children aged from 6 weeks. Many families travel some distance to attend the centre. Strong partnerships exist with whānau.</p><p>Since the last ERO review, all ABC centres have been purchased by Kidicorp Ltd which provides governance and direction for ongoing improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The well-considered centre philosophy provides detailed guidance for teachers in their interactions with children and whānau.</p><p>The caring and stable staff provide a warm and welcoming environment for parents and children.</p><p>Nurturing and respectful relationships, along with responsive and inclusive practices, encourage children’s sense of belonging and wellbeing.</p><p>Children benefit from a well-organised, purposefully resourced learning environment with a spacious outdoor environment.</p><p>The child-centred curriculum integrates a bicultural aspect that regularly includes children's ideas and views. Experiences and activities are strongly influenced by children’s interests. The programme is responsive to individual needs including promoting children’s engagement in learning.</p><p>Teachers work well in partnership with parents. Inclusive and respectful relations with parents, including families from diverse cultures and backgrounds, are valued. Regular communication keeps parents well informed about their child’s learning and centre activities.</p><p>Supportive transition processes assist children into and across the centre and on to school. Parents are regularly kept well informed about this process.</p><p>Good-quality care-giving and teaching practices help to make sure the needs of children who are under two are promptly responded to and their learning is actively fostered. The needs of these younger children are well met with good opportunities provided for them to lead their learning.</p><p>Managers are developing a reflective culture with a strong focus on improvement. Managers and teachers work well together and communicate effectively.</p><p>Kidicorp has many systems that are helping centres to improve learning outcomes for children. These include:</p><ul>
<li>a review process to identify what is going well and next steps for centre improvement</li>
<li>support to centre mangers for the day-to-day operation of their centres from the regular visits of the organisation’s education and business managers</li>
<li>effective systems and processes for ensuring that children have safe and healthy learning environments.</li>
</ul><h3><span>Key Next Steps</span></h3><p>The centre managers have identified that they now need to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen assessment practices, ensuring a bicultural focus</li>
<li>further develop programme planning and include more bicultural experiences</li>
<li>continue to build on teachers’ understandings and use of in-depth self review</li>
<li>make better use of evaluation in planning and self review</li>
<li>ensure that strategic plans are well supported by appropriate actions, and progress towards goals is monitored effectively.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC St Albans completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC St Albans will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>7 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
