</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Good Seeds Children's Centre (Mt Wellington) has been operating since February 2017, with a maximum roll of 26 children over two years of age. A larger proportion of children attending are Māori or Pacific. The centre is one of two operating under the Good Seed Trust.</p><p>The Good Seed Trust, which is an independent non-profit making organisation provides a framework of operational policies and procedures to support the day-to-day management of both centres. They have a strong commitment 'to equip families to live abundant lives, ensuring success and positive learning outcomes for all'.</p><p>The recently developed centre philosophy includes Christian values and recognises core principles of aroha, manaakitanga and whanaungatanga. It supports an environment that enables children to become C.U.T.E (confident, unique and thriving with enquiring minds). The vision statement, 'strengthening families, transforming communities' underpins centre operations.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are warmly nurtured and there is a sense of peace and a settled atmosphere. The value of 'aroha' is evident in interactions with children as well as with parents and whānau. Children know their environment well and are able to move freely indoors and outdoors and make choices and decisions about their play.</p><p>Teachers engage with children respectfully, often working in small groups. The environment and flexible routines provide time and space for children to become involved in meaningful conversations through the day. Tuakana/teina relationships mean that children support each other in their play and learning. To enable children to think more deeply and discuss their ideas more fully, teachers could consider ways to improve their questioning techniques. This will also help teachers to incorporate literacy, science, and maths concepts meaningfully in the context of their discussions with children as they play.</p><p>Whānau enjoy good relationships with teachers and appreciate regular conversations about their children's learning. To establish partnerships with whānau that support children's learning, teachers could include parents' aspirations for their children in programme planning.</p><p>The centre has established a relationship with the neighbouring school that supports smooth transitions for children and families. Teachers have initiated working relationships with the adjacent playgroup and community centre. The teaching team work collaboratively with external agencies to ensure that children with additional needs enjoy positive outcomes.</p><p>The newly developed philosophy reflects a deep commitment to supporting Māori children and their whānau as well as others from diverse backgrounds. Some teachers skilfully support children and families with English as an additional language, by weaving home languages into meaningful conversations. These practices have created a strong sense of belonging for children and their families.</p><p>Teachers' planning and assessment practices are developing as teachers and leaders build their understanding of a 'Notice, Recognise and Respond' cycle. They are also working towards improving the quality of their records of individual children's learning progress. It is timely for the leaders and the teaching team to revisit the links between their philosophy and planning. Regular evaluation of the centre philosophy, in collaboration with whānau and children, would help to increase its visibility in teachers' practice.</p><p>Internal evaluation at the centre is at early stages of development. It would be beneficial for leaders and teachers to access professional support to strengthen internal evaluation. This learning would help them to evaluate the impact of their practices on outcomes for children.</p><p>Leaders strongly promote the service's vision and associated goals. They support individual and whole-centre professional development. Teacher appraisal processes align with the future direction of the service. Senior managers' appraisal processes should now also be aligned with Education Council requirements.</p><p>The centre is well governed and managed. Management systems are understood by staff. The Trust and centre strategic plans are documented and would be strengthened by the regular evaluation of progress, linked to outcomes for children. Leaders could also consider reviewing Trust and management roles in order to build leadership capacity across the senior management structure.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>improving current practice in relation to health and safety practices</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen internal evaluation across all aspects of centre operations to improve outcomes for children</li>
<li>continuing to build leadership capacity and the quality of teaching practices</li>
<li>providing support for teachers to refine programme planning and assessment practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Good Seeds Children's Centre (Mt Wellington) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance. The owners must provide space for adults working at the service to have planned breaks, and undertake assessment, programme planning and evaluation</p><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Services 2008, PF9.</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Good Seeds Children's Centre (Mt Wellington) will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>9 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
