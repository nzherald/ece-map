</table><p>With the ongoing support of the association this kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Otatara Kindergarten offers a mixture of six-hour days, or morning or afternoon sessions. Three teachers teach the 30 children in the morning and 20 children in the afternoon.</p><p>The Otatara Kindergarten philosophy supports the children to be active learners who explore, enquire, question and work collaboratively with their peers and adults. Children are to be encouraged to take responsibility for initiating and determining their own learning.</p><p>The kindergarten is a well established part of the local community. It is located next to the Otatara Primary School and enjoys close relationships with the school.</p><p>The children are confident in the spacious surroundings and show a strong sense of belonging in their kindergarten.</p><p>The teachers have yet to fully implement the recommendation made in the 2010 ERO report to use effective planning and assessment practices to better promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 23 reviews in the Southland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children work and learn in a settled and relaxed environment. They play well together for extended periods of time. Many of the children have strong friendships with each other.</p><p>Children have a wide range of resources and experiences to choose from, including early literacy and mathematics, construction and creativity. Displays and current activities show that children&rsquo;s interests and learning needs are followed in group programmes.</p><p>The natural resources and interests of the community are reflected in the kindergarten&rsquo;s curriculum and environment, including gardening and promoting active movement. Parents are very comfortable to be in the centre and be involved in activities, in particular the weekly nature discovery programme in the neighbouring bush.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s wellbeing and belonging is well supported as they move onto school. This is greatly helped by the kindergarten&rsquo;s close proximity to the school and the many events and activities the children share with the school.</p><p>The environment and resources provide appropriate challenge to the range of children at the kindergarten. The well-considered environment provides spaces for children to be absorbed in their learning. The children are able to explore, problem solve, be creative and imaginative.</p><p>Teachers have friendly and caring relationships with the children and their wh&#257;nau. They are knowledgeable about their children and familiar with their home lives. They have some interactions that are particularly positive in extending children&rsquo;s thinking as well as helping them to use resources in meaningful ways.</p><p>Teachers have undertaken professional learning to increase their awareness of te reo M&#257;ori and M&#257;ori culture. They integrate a strong bicultural element into the environment and programme, including the wh&#257;nau wall, resources, regular waiata and karakia. Children take part in the local Polyfest and learn about events significant to M&#257;ori. Teachers are committed to appropriately fostering M&#257;ori learner&rsquo;s sense of their cultural identity.</p><p>The Kindergarten South governors consulted widely when developing the vision and goals that guide the long term direction of the association. They have high expectations that the association and each kindergarten will:</p><ul>
<li>involve the community</li>
<li>provide natural learning environments</li>
<li>do what is best for children</li>
<li>be a good employer.</li>
</ul><p>The association is committed to transforming each kindergarten&rsquo;s outdoor play area. Children now play and learn in beautiful and natural environments.</p><p>Governors and staff have a clear understanding of the roles of governance and management in the association. They have developed a useful policy framework and guidelines that support the day-to-day and long-term operation of the kindergartens.</p><p>The advisory-support teachers provide useful feedback and guidance to staff and endorse the high expectations set by the board of governors. Otatara Kindergarten benefits from strong ongoing support from the general manager and other association staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Children&rsquo;s learning is not being sufficiently extended due to inadequate planning and assessment. The association has identified, and ERO agrees, that this is a high development priority for the kindergarten. The head teacher and teachers need to ensure that the planning and assessment expectations of the association and their kindergarten are being met.</p><p>The head teacher and teachers need to develop planning to clearly identify the priorities and associated goals needed to achieve the association&rsquo;s vision.</p><p>Current self-review practices include the gathering and analysis of useful information from a range of sources. To extend the usefulness of self review, the head teacher and teachers need to:</p><ul>
<li>focus on the effectiveness of processes and practices</li>
<li>ensure findings are documented and inform priorities, plans, policies and actions</li>
<li>include a focus on progress towards the vision, goals and outcomes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Otatara Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Otatara Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>5 November 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou &#256;rahi</em> &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>M&#257;tauranga</em> &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
