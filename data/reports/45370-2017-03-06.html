</table><p>With targeted umbrella support from Evolve, guided by suitable action planning, Lollipops Educare Broadway is likely to be well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Broadway is one of four early learning services in Palmerston North under the Lollipops name. In late 2014, Evolve Education purchased these centres. As the umbrella organisation, it governs and manages these services.</p><p>An area manager works closely with, and provides ongoing professional support to, the complex manager and centre leaders. The complex manager has been in her role since November 2016. She oversees the operation of the centre alongside centre managers and has a key role in growing teacher practice.  </p><p>The centre is situated in Palmerston North and is licensed for 74 children, including 24 children up to two years of age. Most of the teaching team are qualified and certificated. There have been changes to staffing and to the role of the centre manager since the September 2013 ERO report.</p><p>Respectful relationships, stimulating environments and relevant contexts for learning that integrate te ao Māori and engage children as lifelong learners are central to the philosophy.</p><p>ERO’s 2013 evaluation identified that the evaluative capacity and the appraisal process required strengthening. Staffing changes have had an impact on sustaining and improving strengths at the time of the previous review. Good progress has been made by Evolve to respond to developing appraisal. Management supports and encourages teacher involvement in professional learning and development (PLD).</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews of Lollipops Educare centres in Palmerston North.<b> </b></p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Relationships between teachers and children are responsive. Children lead their own play. Many sustain their interests for extended periods. They are confident to approach their peers and others to share their ideas and thinking. A positive sense of belonging is evident. Teachers know children well.</p><p>Infants and toddlers have some good opportunities for exploration and to develop their physical skills. Resourcing and natural materials encourage problem solving and discovery. It is timely for staff and managers to review the responsiveness and effectiveness of the infant and toddler programme.</p><p>Children with additional learning and teaching requirements are well supported. Staff work collaboratively with parents to develop plans that respond to the strengths, needs and abilities of individuals.</p><p>Portfolios show children's involvement across centre experiences. Their interests and learning are highlighted, as are ways that families can contribute to this journey. Additional work is needed to better reflect children’s language, culture and identity.</p><p>A sound approach to programme planning is in place. This clearly shows children’s interests and how teachers plan for and respond to their learning. Further knowing about the effectiveness of teaching on outcomes for children is an agreed next step.</p><p>Transitions are well managed and flexible to respond to individual needs. There are established links with local schools.</p><p>An acknowledged next step is for leaders and teachers to further develop bicultural practices, then consider and respond to what success for Māori children as Māori means at the centre.</p><p>Review processes are established and have been used to inquire into aspects of teaching practice. Continued improvement is required. Evolve is further strengthening its framework for review and internal evaluation. This should be useful in supporting teachers to know about the impact of teaching on learning outcomes for children.</p><p>A planned review of the centre philosophy should be helpful in developing understanding of shared values and beliefs for teachers and families new to the centre.</p><p>Centre leaders place strong emphasis on growing and maintaining relationships and building a strong team. A culture of teacher reflection is encouraged. Teachers are actively involved in professional learning and development to build practice. Determining the impact of these opportunities in strengthening outcomes for children is an agreed next step.</p><p>Evolve Education's 2017 strategic intent outlines the umbrella organisation's priorities and direction. Alignment of annual planning at centre level has been strengthened to more clearly focus on these priorities. This includes a useful emphasis on growing curriculum leadership to enhance the quality of teaching and learning. </p><p>The area manager and leaders work well together to assist the effective operation of the centre. They provide feedback to staff about centre performance. Extending the scope of feedback to include more focus on outcomes for children and staff performance is needed.</p><p>The revised appraisal process is comprehensive, and should be useful in growing teacher and leader practice. It is clearly linked to the Practising Teacher Criteria and has a focus on teachers inquiring into their practice to improve outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers and ERO agree that the following key next steps for Lollipops Educare Broadway are to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop self review and internal evaluation practices, to more clearly show the impact of teachers’ practices on children’s learning</li>
<li>continue to build aspects of assessment and planning processes</li>
<li>increase opportunities for Māori children and whānau to have success as Māori</li>
<li>ensure curriculum responsiveness for infants and toddlers</li>
<li>implement and embed the revised appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Broadway completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>Since the onsite phase of the review ERO, has requested an action plan from the governing authority that shows how the priorities for improvement will be addressed. ERO will request progress updates against the plan.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lollipops Educare Broadway is likely to be in three years. </p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>6 March 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
