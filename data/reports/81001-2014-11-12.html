</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Balclutha Playcentre is a parent-led centre and managed by a parent committee. Most parents have specific roles or responsibilities within the centre. For example, an education team guides and supports parents in their role as educators.</p><p>The centre is open three mornings a week. Parents stay for the session. This means that there is a high adult to child ratio. The roll has grown. As a result, the centre’s license has been changed to allow 15 children under two years of age. Many children stay until school age.</p><p>The centre is very welcoming and supportive of families. Families new to town quickly build friendships with others. There are regular family events, including some with an educational focus.</p><p>Parents show huge commitment to the centre. Some attend playcentre courses at advanced levels. As there are no paid educators, money is spent on a wide range of carefully chosen resources for children.</p><p>Over the last three years improvements have been made to the property. This includes, enclosing the veranda to create a wet weather play area and building a new storage area.</p><p>In response to a recommendation in the 2011 ERO report adults have improved the quality of their conversations with children. They continue to work on increasing the use of te reo Māori and the inclusion of a Māori dimension in children’s learning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 11 reviews in the Otago Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The children quickly settle on arrival and confidently select resources, activities and areas of play that interest them. They are calm and focused in their play and play well alongside each other. Māori and Pacific children show a strong sense of belonging in the centre.</p><p>There are responsive and respectful relationships between adults and children. Children confidently leave their parents and work/play alongside other adults. Centre routines are well established but flexible. This enables children to be uninterrupted in their play/learning.</p><p>Parents’ wishes for their children’s learning are shared and generally followed up. Adults, especially the education team, write regular and detailed learning stories. These include possible next learning steps and some links back to parents’ aspirations.</p><p>Children in the centre benefit from:</p><ul>
<li>adults intentionally enriching their language</li>
<li>a balance of adult-initiated experiences and child-led play</li>
<li>purposeful early-literacy learning</li>
<li>the inviting and purposeful way resources, activities and experiences are presented</li>
<li>the focus on building children’s social and emotional competence and ‘foundational skills’</li>
<li>regular learning experiences/trips into the wider community.</li>
</ul><p>Infants and toddlers and their parents can choose to use a special area. This includes a good range of tactile and sensory resources and a comfortable seating for mothers with babies.</p><p>The education team actively supports other playcentre parents. For example, the team:</p><ul>
<li>provides comprehensive workshops for new parents to help them best support their children’s learning and the playcentre</li>
<li>promotes and models ongoing adult learning</li>
<li>encourages and supports emergent leadership.</li>
</ul><p>As part of a national focus, ERO investigated how well the centre supported children’s early mathematical learning. In this centre adults notice and use incidental opportunities well to include experiences such as sorting, patterns, counting, measuring and comparing.</p><p>There are efficient systems in place that help the centre run smoothly. The education team is very reflective and improvement focused. Parents’ ideas and contributions are valued.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The education team has identified, and ERO agrees, that the centre needs to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to increase the use of te reo and the inclusion of a Māori dimension</li>
<li>explore ways to better celebrate the culture and identity of Māori and Pacific children</li>
<li>more clearly show in learning stories how adults add complexity to children’s learning over time.</li>
</ul><p>The present strategic plan ends in 2014. It is timely to consult with parents and develop new strategic (long-term) and annual plans that reflect their wishes/priorities for the future.</p><p>Some aspects of self review could be strengthened. These include building a shared understanding of useful ways to review what happens in the centre, such as children’s learning. Adults need to ask more evaluative questions.</p><h3>Governance</h3><p>The Otago Playcentre Association is facing challenges and uncertainty as the Playcentre Federation and the training it provides undergoes a period of restructuring. During this time, the association has made it a priority to focus on the daily operations of the playcentres. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>managing an association-wide system for all aspects of health, safety and compliance</li>
<li>ongoing provision of playcentre training.</li>
</ul><p>ERO found that the association needs to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the appraisal process for all employed personnel</li>
<li>ensure that association policies provided to the playcentres are regularly reviewed</li>
<li>be more responsive and timely to training needs to enable playcentres to meet licensing and employment requirements.</li>
</ul><p>Each playcentre has the ongoing support of a centre advisor. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>regular visits to provide informal and formal feedback and encouragement</li>
<li>helping parents know what to do to meet the licensing requirements.</li>
</ul><p>Centre advisors should find ways to make best practice common practice across the association, for example through effective self review and planning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Balclutha Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Balclutha Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>12 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
