</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>First Steps Donny Ave is situated in the Chartwell suburb of Hamilton. It is licensed for 50 children including up to 14 children under the age of two years. At the time of this review 38 children were enrolled, including a small number of Maōri children, and children from a range of ethnic groups. The centre provides all-day education and care in two aged-based rooms.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2014 the centre has changed its name from Kids to Five on Donny to First Steps Donny Ave. The governing organisation has also changed its name from Kidicorp to BestStart Education and Care and has become a not-for-profit organisation. A professional service manager and business manager provide support for the centre. The centre operates under the Central North Island Waikato regional management team within BestStart.</p><p>The centre has a new leadership team including recent internal appointments of a centre manager, and a new assistant manager and head teacher. There have also been significant changes within the teaching team. Most are fully-registered and qualified early childhood teachers or in training for their qualifications.</p><p>Through the centre's recently reviewed philosophy the team aims to build strong relationships with children and families to create building blocks for all future learning and development. Teachers aim to recognise and respond to individual children’s strengths and evolving interests. They have developed a strong commitment to honouring the bicultural partnership and multicultural diversity of New Zealand.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO and has responded well to address the areas identified in the 2014 ERO review.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the BestStart organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a broad and rich curriculum. Regular trips into the local community and educational visitors enrich children's learning. A feature of the programme is the extra curricula, optional activities that parents can enrol older children into. This provides opportunities for small group learning. During these periods the younger toddlers remain at the centre, benefitting from a quieter environment. Literacy and mathematics are well integrated and a recent project approach extends older children's ideas and problem solving. Children’s holistic development is supported and they develop a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>Children's learning is individually planned for in partnership with parents. Portfolios, which are available online, capture children’s interests, strengths and learning dispositions. Goals are regularly reviewed and the new individual development plan process has strengthened the evaluation of these goals. Assessment now needs to prioritise the documenting of individual children’s language, culture and identity and show evidence of how complexity of learning has been added through intentional teaching. Children's identities as capable learners are celebrated and shared.</p><p>Responsive teaching strategies support children to achieve success. Oral language and communication skills are strongly supported by knowledgeable teachers. Transitions into and within the centre and on to school are individualised and well considered for children. Children are well supported to become confident and independent learners.</p><p>Māori children have their culture and language promoted. Children learn about areas of local significance and celebrate festivals and events. Te reo and tikanga Māori are promoted by teachers. Teachers share a commitment to their ongoing learning with support from whānau and role models within the team.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs experience inclusive practice and teachers work well with external agencies where required. Children up to the age of two benefit from a calm, unhurried and peaceful environment. Respectful care and individualised routines supports all priority learners.</p><p>The new leadership team is focussing on building relationships with children and families. They have established a shared understanding of the philosophy and are developing a team culture which is supportive and collaborative. Strengthening internal evaluation and appraisal inquiry goals are next steps for the centre. A strategic approach to strengthening the shared understanding of the revised <em>Te Whāriki</em>, early childhood curriculum is also required. Families have been well informed through a time of change in staffing at the centre.</p><p>BestStart's vison is to make a positive difference in the lives of children. Governance and management have developed clear strategic goals with guidelines and expectations for centre practice and curriculum. Regional leadership and management support centre leaders and teachers to enact the vision and goals of the service. There are comprehensive, well-established systems and practices that enable the organisation to monitor, evaluate and plan for improvement across the organisation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next step for First Steps Donny Ave is to strengthen internal evaluation.</p><p>Long and short term reviews and teacher inquiry goals need to be manageable, and purposeful. More in-depth reflection and analysis is required to show how teaching practice has been impacted and what the outcomes for children were as a result of the reviews and inquiries.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of First Steps Donny Ave completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of First Steps Donny Ave will be in three years.</p><p>Adrienne Fowler</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>22 August 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
