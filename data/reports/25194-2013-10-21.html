</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The ABC Howick early childhood centre occupies a converted historic homestead and is located on the main road just outside Howick Village in East Auckland. The centre is licensed for 47 children, with a maximum of eight under two years. Large outdoor areas can be accessed by older and younger children separately. The centre is licensed under the 2008 ECE Regulations.</p><p>ABC Howick has provided early childhood education for many years. In 2011 Kidicorp became the new service provider. New centre managers have been appointed and Kidicorp personnel are involved in supporting transitions in centre management and operations. Well qualified and registered teachers support others who are currently completing training.</p><p>Most of the children on the roll attend the full day programme but there are flexible options and sessions available to meet the needs of families. The learning programme responds to the diverse cultural backgrounds of children and their families. Most of the recommendations in ERO’s 2010 report have been addressed.</p><p>The centre is continuing to integrate Kidicorp systems. Self identified needs are being used to guide recent improvements in centre management and operation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy is inclusive and child centred. Teachers agree that children should develop social competencies through their play. They provide activities that allow children to explore, make choices and decisions about their play. Children’s interests are central to teachers’ planning. The programme is well resourced and teachers avoid unnecessary interruption to children’s play.</p><p>The programme for children under two years is well managed. The attractive learning environment is thoughtfully arranged to allow babies to explore and play with well selected equipment. Routines are flexible and respond to children’s interests and developmental stages. Parents are consulted about the children’s preferences and receive daily feedback. Teamwork and self review in the under two area is evident in recent programme improvements.</p><p>Children can access well organised areas of play. Family play is particularly well resourced and used for imaginative play. Picture books are displayed throughout the centre and reflect children’s current interest. Drawing and writing tables encourage early literacy. The extensive outdoor areas enjoyed by children encourage physical activity and climbing. Children select from the activities provided and teachers move to support their learning.</p><p>Opportunities to make choices in their play help children gain confidence. They engage quickly in activities and are able to stay focused for sustained periods. They develop a sense of belonging and interact positively with each other and their teachers. Teachers value and incorporate children’s cultures into their programme planning. A bicultural emphasis, including te reo and tikanga Māori, is more evident in centre practices and planning.</p><p>Staff are being consulted about centre management changes. New systems for enhancing teacher performance have been introduced. Teachers are becoming more reflective about their professional practice and receive appropriate feedback. Kidicorp support personnel are providing good support and expertise for the new centre managers. Leadership training is helping to strengthen management capacity within the centre.</p><p>Parents and whānau speak highly of the centre. Teachers are welcoming and encourage parents to share children’s interests. Communication with parents is good and is a focus for further development. Teachers are also reviewing strategies for managing children’s behaviour and are working together to identify ways to support children’s transition to school.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The new centre manager is working closely with Kidicorp support personnel. They have designed a strategic plan that sets out guidelines for operational planning and self review. Their self identified areas for improvement are appropriately focused on:</p><ul>
<li>building leadership and evaluation capacity</li>
<li>supporting teacher development and team work</li>
<li>strengthening parent engagement in children’s learning</li>
<li>raising the profile of the centre in the community.</li>
</ul><p>ERO agrees that these goals should sustain further growth and development and result in positive outcomes for children at the centre.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Howick completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Kidicorp has conducted a comprehensive review of health and safety in the centre. ERO would also recommend that centre owners remove or firmly attach any shelving units that could fall over if climbed on, or in the event of an earthquake.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Howick will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>21 October 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
