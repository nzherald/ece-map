</table><p>Lollipops Waikato Hospital is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Waikato Hospital early childhood service is located in central Hamilton, near Waikato Hospital. It is owned by Evolve Education Group and is licensed to provide full day education and care for 50 children including up to 20 under the age of two. The centre operates two spaces, one for children under two and one for those over two. The current roll of 47 is very diverse and includes children with Indian, Asian and African backgrounds. There are a small number of Māori children. The centre continues to cater largely to whānau working at the hospital. This is reflected in the opening hours which are from 6.30am until 6.30pm, Monday to Friday.</p><p>Evolve Education Group provides a framework of policies and procedures to guide centre operation. Evolve management also sets budgets, oversees human resources, finances and Ministry of Education funding. Evolve has recently restructured its management support with the area manager now providing support to a smaller number of centres.</p><p>The centre manager is responsible for day-to-day operations. She is supported by a head teacher in the over two's space. The centre manager is new to her role since the 2016 ERO review. Most staff, over 80% of whom are fully qualified, have been at the centre for less than two years. The diversity amongst staff reflects that of children and whānau.</p><p>The centre philosophy has changed substantially since the 2016 ERO review, as a result of staff and whānau consultation. The philosophy describes the centre's perspective on a number of important elements that contribute to positive outcomes for children in early childhood education. It presents the child as competent, curious and full of potential.</p><p>A key next step at the time of the 2016 review was to strengthen the understanding and use of newly introduced individual planning and assessment processes. These are now well-embedded.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from warm, respectful relationships with teachers. Effective positive guidance strategies promote the development of emotional and social competencies. There are many opportunities for children to develop foundational dispositions for learning such as risk-taking, resilience and curiosity. Children are taught about the various cultures within the centre and are positive about diversity. As a consequence, there is a strong sense of community amongst whānau. Oral language development is well supported. The significant number of English language learners at the centre benefit from specific, individual planning and teaching focused on increasing their fluency. Children's thinking is extended through open-ended questioning, challenges and opportunities for sustained play.</p><p>Teaching strategies are highly intentional. They focus on using children's ongoing interests to facilitate learning. Teachers involve themselves in children's self-initiated play and co-construct activities and games which respond to identified focuses for growth and development. Well informed learning plans are developed for individual children in consultation with parents and whānau. Learning stories and photographic montages show growth and progress over time in relation to these plans. Teacher-directed activities promote learning about the world and children's place within it.</p><p>An inviting and well-resourced centre environment enhances play and learning. Teachers are increasingly using the local hospital context to extend thinking and learning. A range of activities for children reaching the age of five enhances transition to school. These activities relate to strengthening self management and literacy and numeracy skills.</p><p>Teachers are highly conscious of children who belong to priority groups. All priority learners such as Māori and Pacific and children with additional needs benefit from individualised planning and teaching that responds to their particular needs. An external provider for the teaching of te reo Māori and tikanga enhances the sense of belonging of Māori children. This work is supported and reinforced by the head teacher who is also a fluent speaker of Māori. The knowledge and understanding of teachers from other cultures are well used to respond to children from diverse ethnicities.</p><p>Children under the age of two play and learn in a calm and unhurried environment. Teachers engage in one-to-one responsive interactions where the teacher follows the child's lead. Children's rights are respected. They are able to make choices and staff are responsive to their care needs.</p><p>The centre is well managed and teachers are well supported in their roles. A collaborative teaching team has been developed. Individual teacher strengths are well utilised for the benefit of children and whānau. Leaders model respectful practice, particularly in relation to the acceptance and celebration of diversity. There are effective systems to build teacher capability supported by a good balance of centre-wide and individual professional learning and development.</p><p>Comprehensive systems and processes guide all centre operations. Effective policy review is undertaken in consultation with parents and whānau. Area managers are highly supportive. They have been innovative in making improvements to centre operations and services to children. A particular feature has been the provision of extra specialist support for children with additional needs. This support complements that provided by the Ministry of Education and contributes to consistency of service throughout the year. The system for teacher appraisal has been improved since the 2016 ERO review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that it would be useful to continue to strengthen strategic planning to ensure that it better reflects the needs of the centre and that all centre systems and processes align to it. It is also necessary to continue to strengthen bicultural practice. This should involve reviewing the local curriculum to ensure that Māori perspectives, tikanga and local history are included.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Waikato Hospital completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Darcy Te Hau</p><p>Acting Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region - Te Tai Pūtahi Nui</span></p><p>19 February 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
