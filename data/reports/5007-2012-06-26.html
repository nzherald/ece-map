<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Dargaville Free Kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Northern Kindergarten Association (NKA). The Association provides the kindergarten with support personnel, teacher professional development, management support and a framework of policies and systems. This is supporting the teaching team to maintain and improve aspects of their professional practice and programme management.</p><p>The kindergarten draws families from a wide area and yet it retains a strong sense of history and community. The kindergarten is well resourced and the environment is presented in such an interesting way that it invites children&rsquo;s learning and investigation.</p><p>The head teacher has led a review of the kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy and practices. With Association support, she has introduced new teaching approaches that focus on fostering children&rsquo;s competence as capable, self-managing learners. Teachers could now consider reviewing the value of some of the more teacher-directed activities evident during routine times. Children are confident and capable learners. They are relaxed about approaching adults, play together cooperatively and develop friendships with their peers.</p><p>Teachers continue to integrate literacy, numeracy and other curriculum areas within the context of play. Te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori is integrated into programmes with valuable assistance from a M&#257;ori advisor in the Association. Teachers provide good support for child-initiated learning experiences. The teaching team are working together to establish a cohesive team with shared understandings and teaching approaches.</p><p>Since the previous 2009 ERO review teachers have used self review as a basis for making many improvements to the learning environment. These improvements have enhanced the quality of children&rsquo;s learning experiences. ERO, managers and teachers agree that the Association can further support the teaching team to establish a positive team culture and create greater alignment between the centre&rsquo;s strategic and annual plans and the Association&rsquo;s strategic plan.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Dargaville Free Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atDargaville Free Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Since ERO&rsquo;s 2009 review there has been an extensive upgrade of the indoor and outdoor environment which has effectively enhanced children&rsquo;s learning opportunities. This has included building a very attractive maihi/entrance and incorporating a koru design into the entrance pathway to welcome children, families, and visitors to the kindergarten.</p><p>Teachers face the challenge of a falling roll that has resulted in the kindergarten adopting longer hours of operation under the kindergarten day model.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><em>Socially competent children.</em> Children are settled and independent. They communicate well with peers and adults and are focused and actively engaged in the programme. They appear socially competent and confident. Firm friendships are being formed between children and they are developing useful negotiation skills through their play. Flexible routines provide opportunities for children to enjoy extended periods of social and imaginative play.</p><p><em>Respectful and learning focussed interactions.</em> A wh&#257;nau atmosphere and respectful, caring relationships are evident amongst children, teachers and parents. Staff listen to children&rsquo;s interest and respond to them appropriately. Language development is consistently well supported and teachers are expanding children&rsquo;s vocabularies. Teachers use mat-time to promote complex ideas that children can incorporate into their play.</p><p><em>Bicultural practice.</em> Teachers are committed to bicultural practice and are respectful of M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau aspirations. A M&#257;ori education plan has been developed with support from the Association. The M&#257;ori advisor works with the teaching team to promote their understanding of te reo me nga tikanga M&#257;ori. Parents report that children are sharing waiata with family members at home.</p><p><em>Health and safety.</em> Good health and safety systems are in place. Teachers vigilantly supervise the outdoors and scan the indoor environment regularly. Extensive improvement to the learning environment has enriched children&rsquo;s play opportunities and promoted more independent and purposeful play. Children&rsquo;s perspectives are consistently being woven into the programme.</p><p><em>Programme provided for children.</em> Teachers support learning through child-led and child-initiated interests and play. The programme is developed on the basis of children&rsquo;s interests. Literacy and numeracy are integrated into contexts that are meaningful to children. The learning environment is specifically designed and richly resourced to enhance and support their learning.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>Enhancing learning programmes for children. ERO agrees with the high priority that teachers have given to increasing the use of ICT to support children&rsquo;s learning and promoting greater physical challenge for children in the outdoors. In addition, teachers could consider:</p><ul>
<li>making families&rsquo; diverse cultures and languages more evident in the programme and more visible in the environment</li>
<li>specifically planning how they will respond to children&rsquo;s emerging interests and ideas, extend children&rsquo;s learning through increased challenge and promote complexity in children&rsquo;s play</li>
<li>having formal discussions with parents about their aspirations as a basis for setting goals for individual children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><p><em>Management support for quality practices.</em> The Association has good processes to support teachers&rsquo; practice. To make these most effective, the Association could consider working with teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>consult with parents/wh&#257;nau as part of their processes for review and development</li>
<li>create greater alignment between the centre&rsquo;s strategic and annual plans and the Association&rsquo;s strategic plan</li>
<li>strengthen shared understandings about teaching approaches</li>
<li>continue reviewing, refining and documenting processes for planning, evaluation and assessment.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Dargaville Free Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreManagement Assurance andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to prepare for relicensing the association and teaching team should review kindergarten operations against the requirements and expectations of the 2008 regulations, curriculum framework and licensing criteria for early childhood services.</p><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendations</h2><p>ERO and the kindergarten managers and teachers agree that the priorities for development are to:</p><ol>
<li>improve the teaching team&rsquo;s planning and assessment of children&rsquo;s learning and the evaluation of the quality of the programme over time</li>
<li>develop shared understandings about best practice in early childhood education and to work towards enriching teaching and learning.</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-dargaville-free-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Dargaville Free Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Dargaville Free Kindergarten.</p><p>Dargaville Free Kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Northern Kindergarten Association (NKA). The Association provides the kindergarten with support personnel, teacher professional development, management support and a framework of policies and systems. This is supporting the teaching team to maintain and improve aspects of their professional practice and programme management.</p><p>The kindergarten draws families come from a wide area and yet it retains a strong sense of history and community. The kindergarten is well resourced and the environment is presented in such an interesting way that it invites children&rsquo;s learning and investigation.</p><p>The head teacher has led a review of the kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy and practices. With Association support, she has introduced new teaching approaches that focus on fostering children&rsquo;s competence as capable, self-managing learners. Teachers have also begun a programme of professional development to assist in enhancing children&rsquo;s social skills. As a result, children are confident and capable learners. They are relaxed about approaching adults, play together cooperatively and develop friendships with their peers.</p><p>Teachers continue to integrate literacy, numeracy and other curriculum areas within the context of play. Te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori is integrated into programmes with valuable assistance from a M&#257;ori advisor in the association. Teachers provide good support for child-initiated learning experiences. Teacher-directed activities could be better used to support children developing independence. The teaching team are working together to establish a cohesive team with shared understandings and teaching approaches.</p><p>Since the previous 2009 ERO review teachers have used self review as a basis for making many improvements to the learning environment. These improvements have enhanced the quality of children&rsquo;s learning experiences. ERO, managers and teachers agree that the Association can further support the teaching team to establish a positive team culture and more transparent strategic planning that provides clear guidance for future development.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
