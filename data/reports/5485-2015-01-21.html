<p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Edna McCulloch Kindergarten is one of four kindergartens governed by the Oamaru Kindergarten Association (OKA). It is open during school day hours.</p>
<p>Since the last review in May 2010, there has been significant change at the kindergarten. There is a new teaching team and head teacher. The head teacher had spent one term in her new role at the time of this review. She is establishing the team culture while reviewing systems, practices and aspects of the environment and programme.</p>
<p>The kindergarten’s philosophy is based firmly on respect for others and the environment. This is strongly evident in practice and deliberately taught.</p>
<p>The kindergarten has large indoor and outdoor environments. These are well used during the daily programme.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<h4>Governance and management</h4>
<p>The kindergarten is very well supported by the Oamaru Kindergarten Association (OKA). The board has a positive relationship with the general manager who effectively and efficiently manages the kindergarten. They have developed a useful strategic plan which is about to be reviewed to ensure further alignment with changing priorities.</p>
<p>Since ERO’s last review of the other three kindergartens and the OKA (earlier in 2014), the board and leaders have begun implementing plans for improvements identified at the time. These include a review of communication systems, and attending a workshop to build understanding of the principles of The Treaty of Waitangi and how they apply within the organisation. The general manager and education services manager (ESM) have also begun professional development for the OKA head teachers around leadership and self review.</p>
<p>The education services manager (ESM) travels from Christchurch to visit the kindergarten. She and the general manager support the kindergarten to implement the high expectations they have for children’s learning and wellbeing. The ESM provides valuable guidance to the newly established teaching team at Edna McCulloch. Head teachers from the other association kindergartens also provide helpful support for the new head teacher as she becomes familiar with the service and its systems.</p>
<p>The OKA should consider whether additional, more accessible input from the ESM or other leaders within the OKA is needed to support the teachers at the kindergarten. This would ensure current improvements are maintained and developed in teachers’ daily practice.</p>
<h4>Centre practice</h4>
<p>The kindergarten environment is welcoming and relaxed. The large play area offers huge potential for children’s learning. The teachers support children’s wellbeing and encourage a sense of whānau and belonging. ERO observed positive, supportive relationships between adults and children. Some children have developed strong friendships. They learn and play well together. Parents are comfortable to stay and join in the programme with their children.</p>
<p>The teachers are beginning to form a cohesive team. They are becoming familiar with one another’s strengths and skills. The new head teacher is focused on building positive relationships. She is establishing useful centre-wide systems, routines and expectations for teaching practice and for children’s behaviour.</p>
<p>There have been significant improvements in developing the environment and providing learning opportunities for children within the programme. Children have more choice and better access to resources. A range of activities provide regular opportunities for children to explore, discover and create. There has been some intentional resourcing of equipment to support learning and teaching in mathematics. Group times provide good opportunities for teachers to recognise children’s interests and capabilities.</p>
<p>The kindergarten is using some useful self-review processes and practices. These are building teachers’ capability and improving outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>The head teacher and her team are making good progress in identifying strengths and next steps for development. It is now time to consolidate and embed the changes and develop ways to maintain and build on the improvements made. This is more likely to occur with regular ongoing guidance and support.</p>
<p>The team’s next steps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>further developing assessment, programme planning and evaluation</li>
<li>building teachers understanding of children’s working theories</li>
<li>embedding self review and widening the scope of reviews to include the quality of interactions and the integration of Māori perspectives in programmes and practices.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edna McCulloch Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Edna McCulloch Kindergarten will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p>
<h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul>
<p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
