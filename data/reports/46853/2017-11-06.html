</table><p>Stronger systems, processes and leadership are required to support a collaborative centre-wide approach to improving teaching practice and learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>YMCA Early Learning Centre is a community-based service administered by the YMCA in Whanganui. The centre opened in 2015 and is licensed for up to 59 children, including 30 up to two years of age. Of the 52 children enrolled, 17 identify as Māori.</p><p>The YMCA board has overall responsibility for governance. The manager of the centre is responsible for day-to-day operations and programme development. She reports to the YMCA chief executive officer (CEO) who reports to the board. Six of the eight staff, are qualified and fully registered teachers.</p><p>The service philosophy promotes the values of caring, respect, honesty, responsibility and enjoyment in life, which generates health in mind, body and spirit.</p><p>This is the first ERO external evaluation of this service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are nurtured in an environment that supports self-management and independence. Teachers encourage language development and engage in sustained conversations with children. There is a strong focus on creativity, science and literacy, which are integrated through daily experiences.</p><p>A limited range of resources are available for children to explore. Staff recognise that providing more material for children to select from is required to extend their learning. Further resourcing and the redevelopment of the outdoor area continues to be an ongoing focus.</p><p>Teachers provide consistent caregiving, responding sensitively to the individual needs and preferences of infants and toddlers. A separate area gives these younger children their own space to explore. Children are developing warm and trusting relationships.</p><p>Transition into the service is well considered. A key teacher system promotes the sharing of information about the child's needs to assist with this process. Children and families are supported as they transition to school. Useful information is shared with local new entrant school teachers.</p><p>Teachers are beginning to implement useful strategies to promote Māori children's culture, language and identity. Children have access to a programme that includes the use of te reo Māori, waiata and natural resources. Teachers are building strong relationships with whānau Māori as a platform for developing authentic learning partnerships to improve outcomes for children.</p><p>Pacific languages and cultures are promoted by teachers to support children's sense of belonging. Targeted teacher professional development contributes to a shared understanding of what success as Pacific looks like for learners at this centre.</p><p>Children's learning portfolios show useful planning for individuals. Teachers notice, recognise and respond to children's interests, skills and dispositions. Stories show children's learning progression over time. The teaching team continues to build a shared understanding of what centre philosophy looks like in practice. To further improve practice, leaders and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>establish clear expectations of a planning process which aligns with good practice</li>
<li>evaluate the effectiveness of teaching practices, and their impact on children's learning.</li>
</ul><p>A clear vision sets the direction for the service and aligns to the YMCA's core values and centre philosophy. Governance and leadership show a commitment to improving learning outcomes for children. Clear lines of reporting between the CEO and the centre manager are evident. However, these meetings are not formally documented.</p><p>The centre manager needs support to further develop her leadership skills. Governance agrees that targeted support is required to enhance systems and processes that promote sustained improvement.</p><p>A useful self-review framework guides inquiry. Regular and spontaneous reviews are undertaken in response to centre priorities. Leaders agree that internal evaluation requires further strengthening, to develop a more cohesive process that aligns to centre priorities for learners. Building leaders and teachers understanding of the process is a key next step.</p><p>A robust teacher appraisal process has yet to be established. Teacher reflection lacks understanding and depth. Explicit support and resourcing should be established to foster leadership and ongoing development for registered teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified that key next steps are to develop:</p><ul>
<li>an appraisal system to improve teaching practices and leadership, including appraisal for the centre manager</li>
<li>leadership systems and processes that promote quality improvement</li>
<li>clear expectations for effective assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>internal evaluation to inform ongoing developments and improvement for children's learning.<b> </b></li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of YMCA Community Early Years Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to the implementation of a system of regular appraisal. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>develop a robust system of appraisal with a focus on developing competent staff.<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7]</em></li>
</ul><p>To improve practice, management should:</p><ul>
<li>include explicit reference to the Vulnerable Children Act 2014 policy and safety checking process in the child protection policy and recruitment policy.<b> </b></li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of YMCA Community Early Years Learning Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Patricia Davey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>6 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
