<p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The Garden Grove Montessori offers Montessori education for children over the age of two. Teachers provide a warm and welcoming environment for children and their parents. Children play and learn in a positive and caring environment. The culture and ethnicity of those attending the centre are valued and celebrated.</p>
<p>Since the last ERO review in 2010, the centre has a new owner/manager and a number of new staff. The manager has made many significant improvements and is continuing to foster effective teaching and leadership. The centre's processes for self review are now established. As a result, children benefit from an enriched bicultural programme, a more consistent focus on literacy and mathematics learning, and improved provisions for health and safety. The quality of teachers’ assessment and the recording of children’s learning have also improved. Children and staff have a clear and shared understanding of the centre programme, routines and expectations.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children at Garden Grove Montessori learn and play in a caring and supportive environment. This helps them to quickly settle on arrival and to feel that they belong. Parents are made to feel welcome and involved in their child’s learning and in the life of the centre.</p>
<p>Teachers know the children well and are responsive to their learning, interests and individual abilities. The children are well supported to develop skills and independence in their learning. ERO observed children interacting positively and respectfully with each other and with adults.</p>
<p>Children benefit from the Montessori programme and have time to explore their interests. The centre’s resources for play and learning are attractive, engaging and accessible. Teachers use them well to build on children’s learning.</p>
<p>Teachers have a strong focus on children’s learning. They have improved the quality of their planning and assessment. They regularly share their observations and experiences with each other. Children’s profiles more consistently show what they have learnt and the future focus for their learning. Parents are increasingly being involved in their child’s learning.</p>
<p>Children benefit from well-planned individual and group experiences that cater for their emerging learning, needs and interests. Their teachers model positive ways of relating with others. They intentionally support children’s literacy and mathematics learning through their interactions. Children are well-supported with transitions within the centre and when they move on to school.</p>
<p>The centre has a strengthened focus on self improvement. Teachers are becoming active participants in a culture of self reflection and evaluation. Teachers are reflecting on their own practices and sharing their experiences of children’s learning. The manager has introduced a useful framework to guide self review. She is building capacity within the teaching staff. Teachers have opportunities to lead the emerging focus areas for improving the centre programmes.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>The centre manager and ERO agree the next steps are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>better link some aspects of the strategic planning and assessment with the centre philosophy</li>
<li>review the bicultural programme.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Garden Grove Montessori Preschool Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Garden Grove Montessori Preschool Ltd will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p>
<h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul>
<p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
