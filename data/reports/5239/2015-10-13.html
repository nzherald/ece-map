</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kindergarten, previously known as Keith Street Kindergarten, is situated in Whanganui. It is one of 14 kindergartens administered by the Whanganui Kindergarten Association. The kindergarten is licensed for 30 children. Sessions operate from 8:30am to 2:30pm. All teachers are qualified and registered with a range of teaching experiences.</p><p>The governing board is responsible for setting the overall strategic direction for the organisation. The day-to-day running of the association is the role of the general manager, who is responsible to the board. Two senior teachers are employed to support the learning and development of teachers. Two cultural advisors were recently been appointed to support teachers to realise potential and support success for Māori and Pacific children.</p><p>There has been sustained progress in relation to the October 2012 ERO review areas for improvement. This has been well supported by focused professional learning and development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Whanganui Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well supported in a programme where they recognise themselves as competent and capable learners who are active, enquiring and empowered to be independent.</p><p>The kindergarten’s philosophy focuses on the priorities of <em>competence, confidence, connection, contribution</em> and <em>self regulation</em><em>.</em> These are evident in inclusive and respectful practices that support the relationships teachers have with children and their families.</p><p>The philosophy is strongly evident in the programme. Priorities for children’s learning are driving the programme, with a focus on positive learning outcomes. Children and families are valued, cultural diversity is celebrated and a sense of belonging is generated. The environment provides opportunities to experience challenge, risk taking and discovery. Children enthusiastically participate in a play-based programme and have fun.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well supported in a welcoming and inclusive environment which is focussed on supporting children and their families. External agencies, families and teachers work together to support children's progress and development.</p><p>Central Kindergarten’s curriculum is responsive to children’s learning. Teachers know children well and support their interests. Teachers help children’s development of literacy and mathematics by focusing on print awareness and using open-ended resources for mathematical exploration.</p><p>Collaborative ways of working are encouraged by everyone involved in the kindergarten. Teachers listen to and value children’s input, which is contributing to decision making. Learning is celebrated with children, parents and whānau.</p><p>The ‘Priorities for Children’s Learning’ kindergarten initiative is guided by the senior teachers’ response to a recent ERO National Evaluation report. This comprehensive, sound and strategic framework is used to strengthen planning, assessment and evaluation processes in each kindergarten.</p><p>Children’s portfolios provide a useful record of their emerging interests with some links to prior learning experiences. Teachers extend children’s opportunities through a collaborative approach. Staff revisit children’s learning to inform their teaching. Teachers plan to focus on increasing continuity of learning in assessment.</p><p>Teachers use a narrative assessment approach to show learners’ engagement and emerging interests and ideas in the programme. Recent priorities include making children’s learning more visible through planning and individual profile documentation.</p><p>Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are incorporated in teacher practice and centre routines. Leaders and teachers plan to further develop the curriculum to promote success for Māori children. ERO affirms this focus.</p><p>A Pacific cultural advisor is successfully building the capacity of the teaching team in recognising and supporting the place of children’s culture and identity and building relationships with families.</p><p>Careful consideration is given to supporting children when they start kindergarten. Teachers continue to develop positive links with local schools to assist children and families making transitions.</p><p>A well-structured framework is providing teachers with a clear understanding of the purpose and process for self review. They are making good use of self review to evaluate the impact of teaching and programmes on children’s learning, guide improvement and sustain effective practices. Leaders and teachers have identified the importance of further embedding the self-review framework to strengthen the quality of teaching to promote outcomes for all children.</p><p>A well-considered approach to change and improvement focuses on building a collaborative team through shared leadership. This has been ably led by the head teacher, with good support from the senior teacher.</p><p>Appraisal effectively supports teachers’ ongoing professional learning and development. Priorities for children’s learning, Practising Teacher Criteria, Professional Standards and <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em> are well aligned within the process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher, head teacher, staff and ERO agree on the following key next steps to:</p><ul>
<li>further embed the use of the self-review framework to strengthen high quality teaching to promote outcomes for all children</li>
<li>continue to strengthen teachers’ knowledge and understanding of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori.</li>
</ul><p>The senior management team of the Whanganui Kindergarten Association is continuing to build teacher’s capability to be more responsive to Māori and Pacific children’s culture, language and identity to enhance culturally responsive practices. ERO affirms this direction.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Central Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>Central</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
