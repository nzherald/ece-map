</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Montessori Homebased Care is a privately-owned, home-based care and education service. The owner is an early childhood qualified teacher who is also the visiting teacher/coordinator. She is responsible for a number of educators who take care of not more than four preschool children, at one time, in their own homes. All of the educators have early childhood qualifications. Three out of five educators have completed Montessori diplomas.</p><p>The service is licenced for up to a total of 60 children. At the time of the review, there were 21 children on the roll.</p><p>The owner has set a clear vision for the direction of the service. This is strongly based on the Montessori approach. The service's philosophy states that it 'strives to provide warm and attentive care to children, promoting confidence in exploration, independence, concentration and communication'.</p><p>This is Montessori Homebased Care's first Education Review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Montessori Homebased Care is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Children's learning and wellbeing are well supported by the educators and service coordinator. Children receive personalised, individual care and attention. This is based on each child's interests, needs and abilities. The coordinator provides high quality Montessori-based resources for each home.</p><p>The curriculum is effectively providing an interesting and stimulating learning environment for children. The service's philosophy states that the Montessori-based approach recognises children's learning styles and pace of learning. This is evident in the documentation provided by the coordinator. There are strong links to Te Whāriki, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. The coordinator is in the early stage of considering how the 2017 update of the curriculum will impact on teaching and learning in the educators' homes.</p><p>The individual nature of the programme, and the small numbers of children in each setting mean that priority learners are well provided for. Children, many of whom are under two years of age when they begin, transition into homes through an appropriate process of visits with parents. Educators and the coordinator are aware of the diverse needs of the children and their families, and respond appropriately.</p><p>Educators build strong, positive connections and relationships with parents and families. There is ongoing communication with parents about outings, their children's learning, and health and wellbeing. The coordinator is building relationships with families and seeking effective ways to communicate with busy parents.</p><p>There is an expectation that educators will continue to build on their te ao Māori knowledge and implement bicultural practices. The coordinator provides assistance to educators in this area. These practices are supporting children to learn aspects of biculturalism, and for Māori children to succeed as Māori.</p><p>Educators are well supported. The coordinator has established clear guidance for educators about her expectations of teaching and learning. She leads well-paced, needs-based professional learning and development. Educators are provided with opportunities to gain Montessori qualifications, and to participate in ongoing professional development. They collaborate in planning, and the production of resources. The coordinator is building educator capacity through ongoing coaching and mentoring, and the provision of regular feedback.</p><p>The coordinator has established some useful systems for the day-to-day monitoring of the programme, and aspects of health and safety. She has recently spent time organising documentation so that information is more readily available.</p><p>The recent focus on appraisal as part of a self-review process has resulted in new job descriptions, and a simplified appraisal document. Assistance from an external provider has been useful to establish a model for future self review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service coordinator and ERO agree that the next steps are to continue to develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>more effective and efficient management systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>educators' knowledge and use of te ao and te reo Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the performance management process so that there are clear, measurable and achievable goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self review to improve outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Montessori Homebased Care Christchurch completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Montessori Homebased Care Christchurch will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>8 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
