A psychosocial programme is provided for children who are patients in the Kidz First Children&rsquo;s Hospital in both the Medicalcare and the Surgicalcare units. The service is provided to both patients and their family members in purpose built activity rooms, at the bedside and in treatment rooms. Team members of the service are part of the multidisciplinary healthcare teams.</p><p>The people who work at Kidz First demonstrate warmth and compassion to children and their families. They show genuine interest and concern for the patients of the hospital and their families. The staff make every effort to settle children into the variety of Kidz First teaching and learning spaces.</p><p>The learning programme provides children with the freedom and opportunity to choose activities and resources that are of interest to them. The extensive variety of resources helps the play specialists to provide suitable learning opportunities and experiences for a wide range of age and ability groups. The play specialists make themselves available to assist children to follow their interests. They also help children to learn about and cope with any medical procedures needed.</p><p>There is good assessment information about children&rsquo;s medical care needs. Assessment practices now need to be strengthened to record more clearly the learning that is occurring for children. Current information about the progress of children describes what they are doing rather than the learning that is occurring for them. Programme evaluation could also be improved.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kidz First - Surgicalcare was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKidz First - Surgicalcare.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>The centre managers suggested that within these areas that ERO could considerhow well the play specialists document and track children&rsquo;s progress and development in teaching and learning.</p><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Kidz First Children&rsquo;s Hospital provides a specialist play and recreation service for hospitalised children, their siblings and their families. The programme and service operates on weekdays. Children have access to play equipment and activities at their bedside and in centralised playrooms. Children who are staying in the hospital in the evenings and over weekends have access to play equipment.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><em>The learning programme.</em> The learning programme provides children with the freedom and opportunity to choose activities and resources that are of interest to them. A wide range of developmental resources are accessible to children. The extensive variety of resources helps the play specialists to provide suitable learning opportunities and experiences for a wide range of age and ability groups. The learning programme is organised in a way that supports children with limited mobility to engage appropriately in learning. All children have access to good quality art equipment. The play specialists make themselves available to assist children to follow their interests. Play specialists also help children to learn about and cope with any medical procedures, and make good use of role play to prepare children.</p><p><em>Programme planning.</em> Programme planning is flexible and caters for the very specific nature of this service. There are a range of suitable plans in place that are relevant to the delivery of the early childhood programme. Plans clearly identify goals for children within the hospital environment.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p><em>Tracking children&rsquo;s progress and development.</em> Assessment practices do not capture well or record clearly the learning that is occurring for children. Children at hospital for three days or longer have some assessment information gathered about their interests and the tasks and activities that they have been involved in. In addition children who have regular visits to hospital have assessments that are linked together to capture what has been happening for them over time. However, assessment practices for learning need to be further strengthened. Current information about the progress of children describes what they are doing rather than the learning that is occurring for them. There is good assessment information about children&rsquo;s medical care needs.</p><p><em>Programme evaluation.</em> Programme evaluation is not well established. The staff should ensure that programme evaluation identifies clearly where improvements can be made and then define how this will happen. Resources that are needed to support improvement should also be identified by the play specialists.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Kidz First - Surgicalcare completed an ERO Centre ManagementAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendations</h2><p>ERO and the centre managers agree that:</p><ol>
<li>the play specialists should review and improve the way that they track children&rsquo;s learning and development over time.</li>
<li>the play specialists should better identify where improvements can be made in the learning programme and then define how this will happen.</li>

The staff make every effort to settle children into the variety of Kidz First teaching and learning spaces.</p><p>The learning programme provides children with the freedom and opportunity to choose activities and resources that are of interest to them. The extensive variety of resources helps the play specialists to provide suitable learning opportunities and experiences for a wide range of age and ability groups. The play specialists make themselves available to assist children to follow their interests. They also help children to learn about and cope with any medical procedures needed.</p><p>There is good assessment information about children&rsquo;s medical care needs. Assessment practices now need to be strengthened to record more clearly the learning that is occurring for children. Current information about the progress of children describes what they are doing rather than the learning that is occurring for them. Programme evaluation could also be improved.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
