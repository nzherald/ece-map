<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h4>Terms of Reference</h4><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Discoveries on Boon Street governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the June 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>the quality of the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the quality of self review</li>
<li>the quality of management processes, including provisions for health and safety</li>
<li>any other issues relevant to the governance, management and operations of the service during the course of the review.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Discoveries on Boon Street in Manurewa, Auckland provides education and care for children from birth to school age. This centre is one of three privately owned early childhood centres under the same ownership.</p><p>A business manager oversees the operational aspects of the three centres and supports the centre managers in their roles and responsibilities. An on-site centre manager provides daily management for Discoveries on Boon Street. Most of the staff are long serving. The staff team consists of six teachers who are qualified, and one who is in training.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report identified that significant improvements needed to be made in most aspects of the centre. This review undertaken in 2013 acknowledges the good progress that the owners, managers and teachers have made in addressing the areas for development and review. Discoveries on Boon Street will now be returned to the regular cycle of ERO reviews.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>The centre manager, who was new at the time of the 2012 ERO review, is experienced and leads her team well. The good practice identified in the 2012 ERO report has been sustained, including positive relationships, children&rsquo;s sense of belonging and cultural inclusiveness. Children are confident, independent and engaged in their play. Teachers continue to be caring and affectionate and committed to further supporting children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>The quality of the programme has improved overall. Professional development around programme planning has helped the teaching team to develop a shared understanding about planning for children&rsquo;s individual and group interests and needs.</p><p>Many improvements have been made to the outdoor and indoor physical environment over the past 12 months and resourcing has been significantly improved. The newly installed playground for infants and toddlers allows for sustained play. All children now have easy access to the outdoors which has resulted in a more child-focused curriculum.</p><p>Te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori are now better embedded in the programme. This communicates the value that M&#257;ori culture holds in the centre.</p><p>Managers have developed good systems, policies and procedures for meeting accountabilities. Health and safety matters identified in the 2012 ERO report have been addressed.</p><p>Teachers and managers are making better use of self review to identify what needs to be improved and how effective their changes have been.</p><p>Regular management and staff meetings keep the owner well informed of the current situation in the centre. The owners and managers are open to suggestions and welcome discussions from teachers and parents around the operational aspects of the centre. They have identified areas to further develop and are actively committed to making improvements in their service.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>The centre owner, managers and teachers should continue to make improvements that will help extend children&rsquo;s learning experiences. Areas to address include:</p><ul>
<li>better identifying children&rsquo;s interests, strengths and abilities and sharing this with parents</li>
<li>building on parent contributions, as planned, so that parents and teachers are more able to work in partnership to promote positive learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>adding to the learning resources to better cater for the wide age range of children attending.</li>
</ul><p>To ensure ongoing improvement, the owners and managers need to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop the effectiveness of self review</li>
<li>clarify their expectations around how the centre&rsquo;s philosophy is to be met by teachers, and provide support and monitoring to ensure that the philosophy is being well met</li>
<li>align the annual plan with the strategic plan to help the centre meet its long-term goals</li>
<li>expand the strategic and annual planning so that they capture the actions and goals needed to achieve the centre&rsquo;s vision.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Discoveries on Boon Street will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>12 September 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Service</h2><table>
