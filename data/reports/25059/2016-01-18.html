</table><p>The service provides well for children's care and wellbeing. However it needs to strengthen strategies for teaching and learning and improve the structures for governance and management.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>St Andrews Christian Pre-School has been providing care and education in Otahuhu for forty years. It offers morning and six hour sessions for two to five year olds in a Christian-based environment. The multicultural staff have established warm relationships with the largely Māori and Pacific community.</p><p>The centre is administered by an informally constituted board under the jurisdiction of St Andrews Presbyterian Church. Currently there are no clear guidelines for the membership, roles or responsibilities of the board. This has led to a lack of transparency and accountability in some of its operations. Many responsibilities have been delegated to the centre supervisor. The sudden loss of the longstanding supervisor in 2013 has resulted in the lapse of some systems and documentation as others have strived to gain knowledge and understanding of management tasks.</p><p>In 2010 ERO reported that teachers had well developed systems for managing the programme for children and high expectations for their learning and behaviour. These are now areas that the current staff need to improve. They have undertaken professional development courses and have begun using self-review processes to identify more effective teaching strategies and practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children show a strong sense of belonging in the centre. They arrive eager to play and are warmly welcomed into a well-resourced, attractive environment. Children confidently engage in independent play and enjoy free access to the outdoor environment. While many children cooperate well with their peers, others struggle with taking turns, accepting guidance from adults or interacting calmly when disputes arise. Teachers need to establish consistent, positive behaviour management strategies before children will be able to engage in deep, meaningful learning.</p><p>Teachers know children well and are responsive to individual interests and personalities. They recognise the different needs of two year olds and separate them for some routines and activities. When teachers work closely with children, engaging them in genuine conversations, children sustain their play well and begin exploring new ideas. The challenge for teachers is to consistently provide opportunities to extend children's thinking and support them to develop their oral language skills. A focus on the interests of groups of children, particularly boys, could provide purposeful contexts for channelling their exuberance and energy.</p><p>Teachers each have a designated group of children whose interests guide the activities they plan. They informally share their programme ideas at weekly meetings, but have not recently had a cohesive programme plan to guide their work with children. Teachers have undertaken a significant review of their assessment practices and documentation which has led to improvements in children's ‘Learning Journey’ portfolios. They now need to use the knowledge they have gained through this process to plan for learning, develop the bicultural content of the programme and promote the values that underpin the Christian philosophy of the centre.</p><p>Parents who were interviewed during ERO’s review appreciate the caring environment provided for their children. They value teachers’ interest in children's wellbeing and are pleased about the play, learning and cultural experiences their children enjoy. Parents feel well informed about their children's learning and acknowledge opportunities to give feedback and comments during review processes.</p><p>The supervisor has endeavoured to maintain management responsibilities since taking on the role in 2013. There has not been strong support from the governance board. However, the recent appointment of a new chairperson has initiated positive improvement. The chairperson is still investigating the structure and systems of the board but has established a strategic plan, begun policy reviews and provided support for the supervisor. As the acting contact person for the centre, she is concerned that the board has no constitutional foundation, nor a process for electing members. She is addressing these matters.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The chairperson and the supervisor agree that governance and management responsibilities should be clarified and clearly documented. It is a priority to develop transparency in relation to board membership and the use of government funding.</p><p>Centre leaders should also work with advisers to make improvements in:</p><ul>
<li>developing annual plans to guide the implementation of strategic goals</li>
<li>ensuring that self-review processes result in improved outcomes for children</li>
<li>targeting professional development to improve teachers’ strategies for managing children's behaviour and supporting their oral language capabilities</li>
<li>establishing consistency in teaching and learning practices</li>
<li>continuing to improve teachers’ use of te reo Māori and their understanding of tikanga in relation to the local area</li>
<li>updating the centre licence to reflect the current contact person.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of St Andrews Christian Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practices leaders should ensure that all staff who are not registered teachers are police vetted every three years. Teachers should also review aspects of their evacuation drills, excursion procedures and strategies for dismissing children at the end of sessions.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to teachers’ appraisal and programme delivery. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>plan, implement and evaluate a curriculum that is designed to enhance children's learning and development</li>
<li>ensure the service is effectively governed and managed in accordance with good management practices</li>
<li>implement a system of regular appraisal</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, Reg 43(a i-vi), C8, C10; Reg 47 (1a), GMA7.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of St Andrews Christian Pre-School will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>18 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
