</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Children at Alexandra Kindergarten receive high quality education and care in a well-resourced, purpose-built facility. The inside and outside areas are spacious and offer a variety of interesting spaces that stimulate creativity and learning. This is one of two kindergartens in the area. Children come from a large geographical area around Alexandra.</p><p>The kindergarten is licensed for up to 40 children at any one time. Some stay all day. Children are aged from 3 to 5 years old.</p><p>The kindergarten vision and philosophy of developing strong positive relationships, inspiring a passion for learning, and nurturing values of respect, integrity, thinking, independence and resilience drive the purpose of the daily programme.</p><p>The 2010 ERO review identified the need for the service to improve the quality of self review and further develop these records for individual children’s learning. A new head teacher has taken over the lead. Under her guidance these recommendations have been successfully addressed. A framework and process have been developed to support robust self review. The head teacher and teachers have in-depth, useful information to help them plan meaningful programmes and improve the way they support children’s learning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Central Otago Kindergarten Association (COKA).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Relationships and interactions between children and teachers and amongst children are respectful and caring. Many children have close friendships with other children. Children and teachers have fun together and enjoy being at the kindergarten. Teachers and parents are in close contact through a variety of ways and parents are comfortable to stay on and play with their children.</p><p>Children play and learn in a very settled, calm environment. They are confident, able to ask for help and know that they will be listened to and supported in their learning. Children know the routines and expectations and are learning to take responsibility for their own wellbeing and for the good of the environment.</p><p>Teachers work well alongside children, listening to their ideas, and are skilled at knowing when to be part of their play and when to step back. Children have choices in how and where they play. They can revisit their learning and their work is respected. Teachers have very good questioning skills. They challenge children’s thinking and support children’s learning with a particular focus on developing their language and communication skills. They have a good understanding of current theory for high quality teaching practice. This is clearly evident in the way they organise the environment and plan for individual and group learning. Teachers pay special attention to helping children who need extra support in their learning, particularly in language development.</p><p>Teachers make the most of the geographical and historical features of the area to provide rich contexts for children's learning. For example, a sustained interest in gold mining led to the construction of a miner’s hut on the grounds, and children regularly go fossicking in the area to see what they can discover.</p><p>The kindergarten is a place of adventure. The well-designed inside and outside areas offer children a range of opportunities for experimentation and exploration and for challenging physical skills. Teachers develop spaces for children to ignite their imagination and provoke creativity, thinking and to foster a sense of wonder. Early literacy and numeracy learning is naturally interwoven throughout the programme.</p><p>Children and their parents are frequently asked about their ideas and interests. Teachers use this information and what they know about children’s strengths and abilities to plan interesting programmes for individuals and groups. Teachers have a clear understanding of planning and assessment which is evident in their stories about children’s learning. They have a system to ensure that all children are discussed and planned for over time. Children’s progress is well tracked through the learning stories that clearly show what learning is happening and what and how teachers are doing to support further learning.</p><p>Teachers incorporate Māori perspectives within their practices and in the environment. The routines and programme support children to develop a growing awareness of New Zealand’s bicultural heritage and as Māori children continue to develop their own culture language and identity as Māori.</p><p>The kindergarten benefits from the strong professional leadership of the head teacher. The head teacher guides self review and has sought professional development to strengthen teaching practice. The head teacher and teachers work well as a team. They have used the kindergarten philosophy and vision to develop very well-considered guidelines and systems that support all aspects of programmes and teaching practices.</p><h4>Governance</h4><p>Over the past three years the Central Otago Kindergarten Association has gone through an unsettled period. There has been a break down in governance, management and systems which has adversely affected the effectiveness and level of leadership provided to each kindergarten. This has led to the board contracting Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association (trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens) in 2012 to undertake an independent review of the management structure. Then in September 2013, Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association was contacted again to provide management support and guidance in an effort to establish robust systems, competent leadership and management.</p><p>The process for redevelopment is still underway and new systems are being established and at the time of this review, ERO found it was too early to tell how well they would be implemented. Overall, there has been a substantial turnover of teachers within the Association. ERO also found that the appraisal process was not robust and needs further development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO found an effective self-review system at Alexandra Kindergarten which is bringing about positive changes. To further enhance self review, teachers could modify some of their questions to make them more evaluative.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Alexandra Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Alexandra Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>26 June 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
