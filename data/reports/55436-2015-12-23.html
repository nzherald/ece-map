</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidz Planet Preschool is a privately-owned centre. It is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 40 children, including 10 up to the age of two years. Of the 39 enrolled, four children identify as Māori.</p><p>The centre has two designated areas, a nursery for infants and toddlers and a preschool for older children. The indoor and outdoor environments promote exploration and opportunities for collaborative play. These areas are well connected and many opportunities exist for younger and older children to interact regularly.</p><p>The leadership team comprises the centre manager and the senior teacher. Most teachers are qualified and one is currently working towards a teaching qualification. Staffing has remained relatively stable since the February 2013 ERO report.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have responded well to the areas for development identified in the previous ERO report. They have focused on: improving curriculum and interactions; positively guiding children’s behaviour; enhancing the learning environment; implementing responsive assessment and programme planning; and developing self review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers work alongside children engaging in and extending their play. There is a strong focus on establishing nurturing relationships between children and teachers, and between children. A sense of belonging is actively fostered.</p><p>The centre philosophy highlights a child-led curriculum with children as active participants and confident learners. There is an emphasis on family and whānau participation and their aspirations and are increasingly represented in the enactment of the programme. The philosophy reflects the principles and strands of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and is evident in practice. Further unpacking the philosophy to identify guiding strategies and teaching practice for assessment, planning and evaluation should help to build a shared understanding and consistent implementation.</p><p>A well-considered curriculum focuses on responding to the individual child’s needs and emerging interests. Learning opportunities promote children to be active researchers and directors of their personal learning journey. Children explore and engage in opportunities that support them to challenge their thinking. Through these they develop and grow their understanding of the world around them.</p><p>The bicultural curriculum has been identified as an area for continued development. A teacher has taken on a mentoring role to focus on building staff cultural competencies, knowledge and use of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori to enhance learning opportunities for children. Developing indicators for a successful bicultural curriculum should help to inform effective delivery. It is timely also to consider how well Māori children’s culture, language and identity are recognised and how the centre is promoting and celebrating Māori success, as Māori.</p><p>Planning is very thorough, collaborative and informed by the notice, recognise and respond framework. Teachers regularly discuss children and their learning pathways. Parents and whānau are informed of their child's progress in learning.</p><p>There is a well-managed approach to building teaching practice and centre operations. The recent restructuring of management has helped to distribute leadership. Improved communication, between staff, has helped to further build leadership and mentoring.</p><p>Self-review processes are well considered and recent reviews have led to useful developments and improved systems. A strong foundation and collaborative approach has been developed to support the review of practice, learning, centre goals, initiatives and operations. Evaluation is improvement focused, informed by research and considers a range of perspectives. Including measureable indicators that inform the quality of practice and initiatives is a next step.</p><p>The centre manager and senior teacher recently developed the appraisal process for teachers. The system requires further development to meet current best practice expectations. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>personalised goals related to individual teacher aspirations and needs</li>
<li>regular observation of practice and an evidence-based portfolio in relation to the Practising Teacher Criteria</li>
<li>advice and guidance for provisionally registered teachers.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and ERO agree the next steps for improvement are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop and implement a clear, evidence-based appraisal procedure</li>
<li>enhance the understanding of a bicultural curriculum and guiding expectations for teaching and learning, including strategies to promote Māori children’s success as Māori</li>
<li>aligned and explicit expectations for consistent teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidz Planet Preschool Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidz Planet Preschool Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>23 December 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
