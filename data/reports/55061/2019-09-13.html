</table><p>Te Pohue Playcentre requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>There is uncertainty about the service's capability and capacity to sustain and improve its performance.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Pohue Playcentre operates under the umbrella of Playcentre Aotearoa. The service is licensed to provide mixed-age sessional education and care for 25 children one day a week. This includes eight children up to the age of two.</p><p>Since the December 2016 ERO report, the New Zealand Playcentre Federation has restructured by amalgamating all associations to form Playcentre Aotearoa. Te Pohue Playcentre is part of the Lower North Island regional hub, supported by a regional manager and support persons.</p><p>Centre support workers and centre administrators employed by Playcentre Aotearoa regularly visit playcentres. Their role is to provide professional advice and feedback to strengthen practice and promote improvement. Responsibility for day-to-day operation is undertaken by centre-elected office holders. Centre members share the duties associated with implementing the programme.</p><p>The previous ERO report for Te Pohue Playcentre identified that centre members, with the support of the association should continue to develop their knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation. Progress in this area is very limited.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine reviews in Playcentre Aotearoa, Lower North Island.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Playcentre Aotearoa's philosophy 'whānau tupu ngātahi – families growing together' of parent-led education, learning through play and the principles and strands of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, guide centre member practices. Parents should regularly revisit statements within the Te Pohue Playcentre philosophy to ensure their ongoing relevance and support a shared understanding by all families.</p><p>Children are provided with an inviting range of learning experiences. Refurbishment of the indoors supports a thoughtfully organised environment that provides for the physical and emotional wellbeing of very young and older children. The centre support worker should continue to support parents to establish shared understandings that determine the programme offered to children. This development should include strengthening documentation to show ongoing reflection of children's learning pathways.</p><p>Adults work collaboratively to provide a welcoming, inclusive learning environment for children and families. They demonstrate respectful and affirming relationships with children. Centre members are supportive and play alongside children. Children’s interactions with each other are friendly and amicable.</p><p>Children are developing confidence in sharing karakia and some basic te reo Māori is heard throughout the daily programme. Centre members are considering ways to promote te ao Māori in a more local, place-based context. Parents continue to develop their understandings of culturally responsive practices.</p><p>Transitions into and out of the centre are responsive to the needs of children and families. Currently centre members are considering how to enhance the 'welcoming' process. They are proactively developing relationships between the service and the local school.</p><p>A small group of parents provides collaborative leadership. Recent participation in the adult education programme has yet to impact positively on the quality of the sessions. Challenges for centre members include: uncertainty about the future of the playcentre building that is owned by the Ministry of Education; and meeting the required qualifications to operate the session.</p><p>Some planned and spontaneous review is used to reflect on aspects of practice.</p><p>Playcentre Aotearoa is reviewing their strategic plan. The 2014 to 2019 plan identifies useful priorities and goals towards achieving the Playcentre vision. Further consideration by centre members is needed to develop useful objectives and success criteria for Te Pohue Playcentre that align to the service's annual plan. Playcentre Aotearoa and centre members should continue to use internal evaluation to identify how well their practices improve outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre support worker provides written reports that generally affirm environmental developments and programme practices. These records are beginning to focus on outcomes for children and next steps for centre members to improve teaching and learning. Reports should focus on providing centre members with evaluative feedback that assists them to sustain and further enhance the good practice.</p><p>Appraisal for the centre support workers, centre administrators and session facilitators requires improving. Further attention should be given to developing deliberate strategies for working towards educators' inquiry goals and making links to relevant professional learning and development. Supporting staff to strengthen their knowledge of high-quality practice should be a key next step.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Playcentre Aotearoa should further support centre members to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improve their understanding of the legislative and regulatory requirements of a licensed early learning service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement sustainable assessment, planning and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop members' understanding and use of internal evaluation practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Playcentre Aotearoa should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improve appraisal processes for the centre support workers, centre administrators and session facilitators to enhance their professional growth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to support leaders to build centre members' understanding of effective internal evaluation through ongoing mentoring that helps them to measure the impact of practices on children’s learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO's evaluation shows that increased oversight and guidance from the organisation is needed to progress the playcentres' areas for development and to better meet legislative requirements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Pohue Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to health and safety and governance and management. To meet requirements the service provider must ensure:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>any areas of glass accessible to children are either: made of safety glass; or covered by adhesive film to hold glass in place if broken; or effectively guarded by a barrier that prevents a child falling against the glass</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the service is effectively governed and managed in accordance with good management practices. <br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, PF7, Regulation 47,1a]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>13 September 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
