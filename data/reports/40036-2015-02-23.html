</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Reporoa Playcentre is located in the village of Reporoa and caters for children up to six years of age. It is licensed for 30 children, including up to 16 children under the age of two years. At the time of this ERO review 30 children were enrolled, of whom 5 identify as Māori. It currently provides sessions on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings for children parents and whānau.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of Rotorua Playcentre Association. The knowledgeable operations manager is readily available to assist with information, and an experienced centre support officer attends playcentre sessions and meetings to advise and mentor members. She reports to the association about compliance with licensing, health and safety and other operational requirements.</p><p>The playcentre education programme assists members to provide appropriate learning opportunities for their children. Recent professional development through a Ministry of Education contract has assisted the association and its centres to use a self-review process to consider how best to recruit, receive, engage and retain members. An important feature was the exploration of a simple method to help new members write stories for children’s portfolios.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five playcentre reviews in the Rotorua Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre is very effective in promoting positive learning outcomes for children and parents. Children have fun and are highly engaged in learning. Areas of play are richly resourced and easily accessible to children at all age levels. They are able to follow their interests in a physical environment that is safe, and offers many challenges that invite children to explore and become fully involved in a wide range of activities. Children are empowered to take increasing responsibility for their wellbeing and for others, make choices, and develop independence.</p><p>There are many activities and opportunities for children to experience and develop early literacy and mathematics skills. Parents notice opportunities to become involved and promote children’s learning. They effectively support the play and development of their own children as well as others. Parents are positive, sensitive and respond to children’s needs. They interact to extend learning opportunities, and give feedback and encouragement when necessary.</p><p>The past and current presidents are providing strong and effective centre leadership, and are well supported by office holders and other parents. There is a united team approach and a strong commitment to playcentre philosophy and vision. The leadership group has worked hard to increase roll numbers and ensure that all new members feel welcome and involved. Parents are actively supported to participate in early childhood training. A feature of the centre is the way parents are supported to enhance parenting skills and helped to interact more effectively with their children.</p><p>Parents spoken to by ERO commented positively about the very effective communication and administration systems that keep everyone informed, and promote sustainability and continuation of direction and good practice. Effective self review is leading to continuous improvement in learning opportunities for parents and their children.</p><p>The playcentre programme is well planned to meet the interests of children and the aspirations of parents. It is closely based on the strands and principles of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and all areas of play are evident in the centre environment. Children and parents extend their learning through regular opportunities outside the centre, undertaking trips and visits, and making links with the local community.</p><p>Progress has been made in developing a stronger bicultural aspect to the centre programme for children through development of a wharenui, involvement in kapahaka, and the provision of te reo/tikanga sessions by a local tutor. Children enjoy these sessions and parents report that they regularly use te reo and songs they learn at home.</p><p>Children’s success in learning is highly visible in individual child portfolios, attractive displays on centre walls, and in high-quality learning stories. Experienced parents effectively use assessment practices that are closely linked to planning. These practices are focused on noticing and recognising what children are doing, and then identifying needs and interests for future planning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre members agree that the centre needs to consider:</p><p>exploring ways of more closely monitoring and tracking the learning of individual children. This could include parents being supported to identify next steps in their children’s learning and ways of recognising progress and development over time.</p><p>building on bicultural practices by parents using te reo Māori in authentic contexts with children</p><p>exploring ways of promoting all aspects of mathematics in centre activities and interactions.</p><p>The association has agreed that recognising and celebrating the learning for both adults and children is an essential part of valuing the ‘Playcentre experience’. Adding a goal to the association and centre strategic plans for identifying and building on programme successes would focus attention on the quality of learning opportunities and outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Reporoa Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Reporoa Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>23 February 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
