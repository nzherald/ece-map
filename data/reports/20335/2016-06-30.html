</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kadimah Preschool is part of the Kadimah School complex in inner-city Auckland and provides education for up to 30 children. It welcomes children from both the Jewish community and from the wider community and includes children from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds. The preschool promotes the Hebrew language and aims to enhance a love of learning within a Jewish environment. The programme is underpinned by the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The preschool is governed by the Bernard Goldwater Educational Trust. The trust has recently employed a new head teacher, who leads a team of one other qualified early childhood teacher and two part-time teaching staff. They are assisted by trust administrative staff.</p><p>ERO's 2013 report identifies children's high level of engagement in a well-resourced learning environment with an inclusive, family oriented atmosphere. Recommendations were to improve self review, curriculum management, outdoor experiences and teachers' integration of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori. There is evidence of recent progress in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The preschool's philosophical beliefs about teaching and learning are highly visible in practice. Caring and respectful relationships are a feature of the environment for children. There is a strong sense of belonging and connectedness, and a holistic approach to learning. Programmes are based on the community's shared Jewish faith, cultural rituals and celebrations, and supported by close partnerships between teachers and families.</p><p>Children are expressive, confident communicators with adults and each other. They are capable thinkers and problem solvers. They share their ideas and learn through self-directed, imaginative and creative play. They develop very good skills for negotiation and social interaction.</p><p>Children's learning is well supported by adults. Teachers listen carefully to children's thoughts and respond purposefully in genuine and prolonged conversations, using complex, mature language. Their responses build on children's prior experiences and expand opportunities for learning.</p><p>Resources that promote children's understanding of the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand are well used and te reo Māori is included, according to teachers' level of confidence. The Hebrew language is an integral part of daily programmes.</p><p>The preschool room is attractively presented and inviting. Very good quality resources support children's learning about literacy and mathematics and their developing understandings about the wider world and their place in it. Children's stories are prominent in displays that feature their detailed, creative art. Displays celebrate the Jewish culture and children's competence as learners, and show strong, meaningful connections across the curriculum.</p><p>Teachers' thoughtful, skilled practice shows their good understanding of early childhood education theory. They know what is needed to promote complex, extended learning. They plan collectively and their evaluation identifies specific learning outcomes from both child-led activities and Jewish celebrations. The teaching team is exploring ways to better record the emergent curriculum and to refine other curriculum documentation.</p><p>Children have regular opportunities to participate in school-wide occasions and junior students visit the preschool each week. These connections and the high quality of the preschool curriculum, support children's transition to the school's junior classes very well.</p><p>The new head teacher is developing a shared approach to leadership. She has established open communications and good support for teachers' professional reflection to foster continual improvement. These discussions form a sound foundation for implementing performance appraisal in the service.</p><p>The head teacher has made a very good start with reviewing and updating policies and procedures. She reports regularly to the trust and is working with the chairperson to strengthen management practices. A draft strategic plan provides a good basis for action plans that the trust and managers can use to guide and monitor ongoing development.</p><p>The preschool's immediate plans include improving the presentation of the outdoor decking areas, using more natural resources, and increasing resources that promote physical activity and challenge. The board chairperson is aware that as the roll increases, the trust will need to consider employing a third full-time qualified teacher.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The trust board chairperson and teachers agree that they now need to embed and build on recent positive developments. Priorities for development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increasing the transparency of governance and management processes, including financial reporting and budgeting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing the process of updating policies and procedures, and reviewing practices to assure the board that all legal requirements are met</p>
</li>
</ul><p>establishing and implementing robust, systematic internal evaluation across all aspects of service operations, using indicators of high quality practice and specific annual plans to monitor progress towards strategic goals.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kadimah Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practices, the board chairperson and head teacher should expedite current plans to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>update all policies and procedures, particularly those relating to personnel and employment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement staff appraisal processes that reflect the requirements of the Education Council of New Zealand.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kadimah Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>30 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
