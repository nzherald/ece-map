<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2>
<h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3>
<p>The service is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p>
<h4>Context</h4>
<p>Hamilton East Playcentre is a parent cooperative located in the suburb of Hamilton East, catering for children from birth to school age, three mornings a week from 9.00 am to 12.00 pm. The centre operates under the umbrella of the Waikato Playcentre Association (WPA) which provides appropriate governance, management and educational support.</p>
<p>Since ERO&rsquo;s last review in 2009 the centre has focused on building its membership and has successfully increased its parent membership from nine to nineteen. Parent education is encouraged and many are actively participating in playcentre education courses. This is leading to further development of the centre&rsquo;s self review, assessment and planning processes. These were identified in the previous review as areas requiring strengthening.</p>
<p>Parents are also supported and encouraged to learn leadership skills and take on roles and responsibilities. The association implements a &lsquo;Supporting Parents Alongside Children&rsquo;s Education&rsquo; (SPACE) programme once a week that caters for infants and first time parents. Parents/wh&#257;nau and children learn alongside each other in a nurturing, safe and positive learning environment.</p>
<p>An experienced and valued centre support worker (CWS) is employed by the association to assist the centre to meet administration and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in six early childhood education services within the Waikato Playcentre Association umbrella organisation.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>The commitment and enthusiasm of the co-presidents, with the assistance of the WPA have contributed to clarity of strategic direction and development in the playcentre. Together the co-presidents provide positive role modelling for parents and children in their learning interactions. Parents and children are developing alongside each other in a supportive wh&#257;nau environment.</p>
<p>Playcentre planning is based on observations and discussions of children&rsquo;s emerging interests, strengths, needs and behaviours. Parents&rsquo; knowledge and skills are valued and all contribute to the planning, implementation and evaluation of the programme. There are clear links to <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em> (The NZ Early Childhood Curriculum). These are evident in planning and assessments. Parent planning of the learning environment provides children with ready access to appropriate resources and equipment. The spacious indoor /outdoor play areas provide a variety of opportunities for children&rsquo;s exploration, social play, and creativity.</p>
<p>ERO observed models of effective teaching practices which include:</p>
<ul><li>actively noticing, recognising and responding to children&rsquo;s individual interests and requests</li>
<li>playing alongside each other and children fostering knowledge of early literacy and numeracy skills through conversations, assessment and shared reading</li>
<li>supporting children and families to develop their knowledge and understanding of te reo M&#257;ori</li>
<li>positive, sensitive and responsive relationships with children.</li>
</ul><p>Members have undertaken both formal and informal reviews of centre operations. Reviews are focusing on teaching and learning practice and children&rsquo;s learning. These reviews have begun to influence changes in practice and are focused on improving outcomes for children.</p>
<p>ERO and parents identified and agreed that the priorities for the centre are to encourage parents:</p>
<ul><li>to more consistently record children&rsquo;s learning and show progress by making meaningful links between learning stories and assessments</li>
<li>to extend ,enrich and respond to young children&rsquo;s learning by providing opportunities for self-directed challenges, co-operative ventures and sustained projects</li>
<li>to provide smooth transitions to school by encouraging parents to develop relationships with schools of their choice.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hamilton East Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Next Review</h2>
<h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p>

<h4>About ERO Reviews</h4>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>Review focus</h3>
<p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p>
<p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
<p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p></html>
