</table><p>ABC Beckenham is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Beckenham operates under the Best Start management structure. Best Start (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large national organisation that owns early childhood education and care centres across New Zealand.</p><p>This centre is licensed for 74 children each day, including up to 24 children under two. It has a nursery area to cater for children under two years old. Another area caters for children aged between two and five years old. This grouping provides good opportunities for younger and older children to play with and learn from one another, reflecting the Māori concept of tuakana teina.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review, in October 2012, there have been some changes to the leadership, including the appointment of a new centre manager in 2014. Most teachers are qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>Centre leaders have made significant progress with the recommendations from the 2012 ERO report. This includes the development of appraisal processes, planning and assessment and evaluation practices. Leaders and teachers demonstrate a strong commitment to increasing understandings of bicultural practices and te ao Māori.</p><p>The centre manager and some teachers are part of a local community cluster of primary schools, and early childhood centres. These relationships promote professional networks and provide targeted professional development to support the learning of children in their community from early childhood to school.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy is reflected by the positive, reciprocal relationships amongst teachers, children, families and the local community. Leaders and teachers actively foster these relationships across the centre and within the community. These practices reflect the Māori concepts of whānanungatanga - family and community; and Ako – where everyone supports and learns from one another.</p><p>The child-centred programme takes account of the whole child and supports children’s wellbeing and learning. Parents are well informed of children’s interests and participation in learning programme. This is evident in the conversations with teachers, attractive wall displays and informative learning stories. The increasing use of technology helps inform a wider group, of people who are important to the child, and encourages them to add their views to the child’s learning journey.</p><p>Children are well supported to make a positive transition into the centre and between the rooms. Teachers provide a flexible approach that is responsive to the individual needs and preferences of the child and their family.</p><p>The well-paced child-centred programme allows children to develop their independence and explore their interests. Children are encouraged to initiate and maintain positive relationships with others. Visitors to the centre and excursions into the community enrich learning experiences and extend children’s social skills in meaningful ways.</p><p>Literacy and numeracy is a strong focus of the programme. Teachers provide a wide range of meaningful experiences to capture children’s curiosity and participation in learning.</p><p>The wellbeing of infants and toddlers is actively promoted through responsive and consistent care giving. Teachers provide well-paced routines that align to home routines, the expectations of the parent, and the needs of the child. Children have time and space to explore and make their own choices and discoveries.</p><p>The centre is well led and managed. Leaders and teachers work effectively together. Teachers are empowered to develop reflective practices and to take a lead in professional areas of interest.</p><p>The centre manager, professional service manager and the business manager work in partnership to successfully implement Best Start management systems including quality assurance and strategic planning processes. These include:</p><ul>
<li>a review process to identify what is going well and next steps for centre improvement</li>
<li>provision of appropriate internal and external professional development</li>
<li>support to centre managers for the day-to-day operation of their centres from regular visits of education and business managers</li>
<li>effective systems and processes for ensuring that children have safe and healthy learning environments.</li>
</ul><p>Centre leaders have a strong focus on effective self review, ongoing improvement, and positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders are highly reflective and have identified a number of areas to further develop. ERO agrees priority should now be given to:</p><p>strengthening and embedding new initiatives in assessment, planning and evaluation</p><p>increasing the focus on the child as a learner in the context of their culture and language</p><p>further developing all teachers' understandings and use of reflective practices and self review.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Beckenham completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Beckenham will be in four years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>25 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
