</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Park Early Learning Centre (ELC) is located in a light industrial area of Henderson with easy access to parkland spaces. It is licensed for 82 children, including up to 25 under two years of age. Families attending come from a diverse social and multicultural community. The centre aims to increase participation in early childhood education and is responsive to community needs and preferences. They offer full-time and sessional education and care and nutritious meals are prepared on site. Many families make use of the 20 hours subsidised funding.</p><p>The centre philosophy is based on children playing and learning through free play and structured play experiences. Children are viewed as competent learners and supported to develop and learn at their own pace. This approach continues to guide teacher practices and curriculum implementation. The centre owner is supportive of staff and involved in the operation of the centre.</p><p>Positive aspects noted in the 2012 report have been maintained, including the welcoming atmosphere and a strong sense of community. Since ERO&rsquo;s 2012 review, teachers have improved assessment and planning process and made resources more readily accessible to further encourage children&rsquo;s exploration and investigation. Although there have been changes in centre managers, there is a long standing staff. Health and safety issues noted in the 2012 review have been addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at Central Park ELC are confident and benefit from warm, affectionate respectful relationships with adults. Children are encouraged to be independent explorers and make discoveries from a good range of accessible resources. They engage in activities that interest them and collaborate in their play. Children move freely between the indoor and outdoor environments, and frequently engage in sustained purposeful play that supports their learning and development.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families well. Teachers create a calm nurturing environment in which very young children have space and time to explore and play. Responsive caregiving supports infants&rsquo; and toddlers&rsquo; need for strong and secure attachments.</p><p>The curriculum arises from the interests of children, the centre&rsquo;s philosophy and the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>. Children contribute to programme planning and assessing their learning. Children are skilfully supported in their learning by teachers who provide challenges to extend the complexity of their play.</p><p>Children are becoming familiar with te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori as they play. Teachers recognise the importance of continuing to strengthen their everyday use of te reo M&#257;ori throughout the programme. The Ministry of Education resource, T&#257;taiako, could be helpful to enhance bicultural teaching practices.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s wellbeing and their sense of belonging are nurtured through positive interactions, respectful relationships and good care routines. These practices help children as they transition into and through the centre. Transition to school is well managed, benefiting children and families. Building stronger links between the centre and schools is a priority for centre leaders.</p><p>Assessment portfolios provide very good information about children&rsquo;s involvement in the programme. Effective use of digital technology allows families to have instant access to information about their children&rsquo;s learning and assessment. Increasingly, parents are accessing this information and contributing to children&rsquo;s learning stories. Teachers are considering the value of maintaining hard copy records of these to enable children and families to revisit learning over time.</p><p>Teachers work effectively as a team. They use self review to reflect on and identify ways to improve their practice. Centre leaders acknowledge the importance of building leadership capability.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s clearly articulated vision and philosophy provide effective guidance and support for centre governance and management. Self review is used to promote development and improvement across the centre through an increasingly collaborative process that is focused on outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre leaders and ERO agree that next steps could include</p><ul>
<li>continuing to develop a more collaborative and evaluative process of self review that includes recording the outcomes of review and change for children</li>
<li>increasing the evaluation of programme planning and teaching strategies</li>
<li>continuing to further develop a bicultural curriculum that promotes M&#257;ori language, culture and identity</li>
<li>continuing to encourage parents and wh&#257;nau to take a more active role in their child&rsquo;s learning in the centre.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Park Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Park Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>3 June 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
