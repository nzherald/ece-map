<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Lyttelton Street Playcentre is one of 50 playcentres administrated by the Canterbury Playcentre Association. After the February 2011 earthquake, the playcentre responded positively to the needs of the community by increasing the roll and opening hours. It now operates five morning sessions each week as a parent cooperative.</p><p align="left">An enthusiastic and dedicated team of coordinators and parents is responsible for the effective day-to-day operation of the playcentre. Adults work well together to provide a learning environment that values parents as the children&rsquo;s first educators.</p><p align="left">The Canterbury Playcentre Association provides parent education and training to build on parents&rsquo; knowledge of child development and learning.</p><p align="left">New parents are warmly welcomed by a supportive and inclusive parent group. Children have good opportunities to make new friends and play together.</p><p align="left">Other positive features of this playcentre include:</p><ul>
<li>the family-group setting where children of mixed ages, including siblings, can play and learn together</li>
<li>the high number of parents who stay during session who show an interest in being involved in children&rsquo;s play</li>
<li>a child-focused approach where the child&rsquo;s emerging interests and preferences are noticed and valued</li>
<li>spacious outside play areas that provide a wide range of physical challenges and opportunities for children to learn about the natural world.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The playcentre association provides a specialist team, He Waka Eke Noa, to support understanding and use of tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori. The coordinators and parents demonstrate a good understanding of the value to all children of incorporating the M&#257;ori culture in the programme. Some parents are making good use of tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori during their interactions with children.</p><p align="left">The playcentre coordinators and parents have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps are to focus on identifying children&rsquo;s learning in assessment, programme planning and evaluation processes and to increase self-review understandings, capability and sustainability in the parent group.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Lyttelton Street Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atLyttelton Street Playcentre .</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The Lyttelton Street Playcentre philosophy states that parents are the first educators of their children. They will therefore work as a team and include all centre wh&#257;nau in decision making. They further recognise that children reach their full potential when parents understand their development and take part in the learning process.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4>Parent participation</h4><p align="left">Parent involvement in the centre strongly reflects the playcentre philosophy. Coordinators on each session provide a good level of support to parents. Adults communicate effectively and work well together to foster a positive learning environment for children. They value the diverse skills parents bring to the playcentre community.</p><p align="left">The playcentre association offers many opportunities for parent education and training. Adults notice children&rsquo;s interests and are consistently involved in children&rsquo;s play.</p><h4>Relationships</h4><p align="left">Relationships between children and adults are warm and caring. Children play well with and alongside other children. Siblings can attend the same session. Children enjoy group experiences and the opportunity to develop friendships with one another.</p><p align="left">Parents and the coordinators work well together and share information to support children&rsquo;s learning and well-being. They show a genuine interest in their own and other children&rsquo;s play. New parents are warmly welcomed by a positive, supportive and inclusive parent group.</p><h4>Child focused programme</h4><p align="left">Adults follow children&rsquo;s emergent interests and preferences in the programme. They offer choices and follow children&rsquo;s lead in play. The programme provides large periods of uninterrupted time for children to follow interests and extend on play ideas.</p><h4>Language</h4><p align="left">Adults listen actively to children and respond to children&rsquo;s verbal and non-verbal attempts to communicate. Adults affirm and extend children&rsquo;s language skills. Children enjoy being read and sung to by adults who take time to encourage children&rsquo;s interest in the stories and music.</p><p align="left">Some parents are skilled at supporting the development of children&rsquo;s knowledge and understanding of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori.</p><h4>Learning environment</h4><p align="left">Children benefit from a well-organised learning environment. Children choose from a good variety of resources and play experiences, including natural materials. Adults change the environment and provide additional resources to build on children&rsquo;s ideas and interests during the session.</p><p align="left">Children make good use of the spacious, outdoor area that provides a wide range of physical challenges and opportunities for them to learn about the natural world.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s interests and participation in the programme are well documented by adults. The playcentre coordinators and parents have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps are to focus more on identifying children&rsquo;s learning in assessment, programme planning and evaluation, and to develop self review further.</p><p align="left">The coordinators and parent group, with the support of the association, now need to:</p><p align="left">strengthen the analysis of children&rsquo;s learning and next steps adults can consider to extend children&rsquo;s learning</p><ul>
<li>show how children&rsquo;s learning progresses over time</li>
<li>use assessment information to plan the programme</li>
<li>ensure that programme planning and evaluation focuses on:</li>
<li>identifying appropriate learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>developing strategies for adults to use when supporting children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The coordinators and parent group, with the support of the association, need to:</p><ul>
<li>increase self-review understandings, capability and sustainability in the parent led team</li>
<li>develop a strategic approach to self review to guide the regular review of policies and in-depth reviews with a focus on teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long-term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with Wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori Children in Early Childhood Services</h3><p align="left">As part of this review, ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3><p align="left">The playcentre association has specific policies that outline the association&rsquo;s responsibilities towards implementing bicultural partnerships in all the Canterbury playcentres. The association provides a specialist team, He Waka Eke Noa, to support playcentre parents&rsquo; understanding and use of tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p align="left">The centre culture strongly reflects M&#257;ori values. The coordinators and parents demonstrate a good understanding of the value to all children of incorporating the M&#257;ori culture in the programme. Some parents are making good use of tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori during their conversations with children. Excursions into the community provide further opportunities for children and their families to be involved in celebrations significant to M&#257;ori and to hear legends retold by the bicultural support team.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Lyttelton Street Playcentre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In order to improve current practice the parent group should:</p><ul>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-lyttelton-street-playcentre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Lyttelton Street Playcentre</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Lyttelton Street Playcentre .</p><p align="left">Lyttelton Street Playcentre is one of 50 playcentres administrated by the Canterbury Playcentre Association. After the February 2011 earthquake, the playcentre responded positively to the needs of the community by increasing the roll and opening hours. It now operates five morning sessions each week as a parent cooperative.</p><p align="left">An enthusiastic and dedicated team of coordinators and parents is responsible for the effective day-to-day operation of the playcentre. Adults work well together to provide a learning environment that values parents as the children&rsquo;s first educators.</p><p align="left">The Canterbury Playcentre Association provides parent education and training to build on parents&rsquo; knowledge of child development and learning.</p><p align="left">New parents are warmly welcomed by a supportive and inclusive parent group. Children have good opportunities to make new friends and play together.</p><p align="left">Other positive features of this playcentre include:</p><ul>
<li>the family-group setting where children of mixed ages, including siblings, can play and learn together</li>
<li>the high number of parents who stay during session who show an interest in being involved in children&rsquo;s play</li>
<li>a child-focused approach where the child&rsquo;s emerging interests and preferences are noticed and valued</li>
<li>spacious outside play areas that provide a wide range of physical challenges and opportunities for children to learn about the natural world.</li>
</ul><p align="left">The playcentre association provides a specialist team, He Waka Eke Noa, to support understanding and use of tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori. The coordinators and parents demonstrate a good understanding of the value to all children of incorporating the M&#257;ori culture in the programme. Some parents are making good use of tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori during their interactions with children.</p><p align="left">The playcentre coordinators and parents have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps are to focus on identifying children&rsquo;s learning in assessment, programme planning and evaluation processes and to increase self-review understandings, capability and sustainability in the parent group.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p></html>
