</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Topkids Mount Maunganui receives comprehensive governance and management from Best Start Educare Centres (formerly Kidicorp), a charitable trust. BestStart education and care centres have a shared vision, purpose and values designed to provide positive outcomes for children. This centre's philosophy is based on building strong and reciprocal relationships, fostering respect and trust amongst family and wh&#257;nau. The individuality of babies, toddlers and young children is recognised and valued in a supportive nurturing environment for education and care.</p><p>Topkids Mount Maunganui is a purpose-built centre catering for children from 3 months to five years. There are three age-appropriate rooms providing education and care. Toptots under 2 years, Topkids 2 to 3 years and Kindykids 3 to 4 years. Each room has a designated head teacher and teachers who know the children well and are familiar with their routines.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 120 including 22 under the age of two. The current roll is 116 with children from a wide number of cultural groups. The centre operates from 7am to 6pm Monday to Friday.</p><p>The centre manager has been leading the centre for one year and she is responsible for the overall day-to-day management of the centre. The majority of the teachers employed by the centre are fully qualified and two teachers are in training. Support staff, including the office administrator and the cook, contribute to children's wellbeing and the smooth running of the centre. Children receive nutritious morning and afternoon teas, and lunches.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review there have been significant upgrades of the centre's environments for learning. Teachers are receiving ongoing professional development, led by the professional services manager in collaboration with the centre manager. The focus has been on biculturalism and noticing, recognising and responding to children's learning and play. The principles of &lsquo;Be School Ready,&rsquo; independence, communication and transition are being increasingly integrated across the centre programme.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Best Start Educare Centre has well-developed systems to support centre operations, and to promote development. Business and professional services managers provide strong and effective support and guidance to the centre manager. The centre&rsquo;s strategic plan implements the key focus areas set by the company in its strategic plan. Currently these are about learning environments and leadership. The trust places high priority on the professional learning and development of its staff.</p><p>Professional leadership is strong and effective. Leaders introduce and share current theory and research about best practice. The professional services manager liaises regularly with the centre manager and provides evaluative reports for each of the three teaching teams. These reports provide clear direction for the centre manager who works collaboratively with her teachers to bring about development in the identified areas. More recently there has been focused development on biculturalism and teaching and assessment practices to improve learning outcomes for children. Collectively, leaders provide well-informed leadership for teachers and support staff.</p><p>Professional learning is valued, and accessible for all staff. Teachers are benefiting from relevant and ongoing professional learning that is closely aligned with the centre's developing appraisal process. Teaching staff develop specific and measurable goals, and there is an expectation that they will inquire into the effectiveness of their practice and document evidence of their progress. There are ongoing opportunities for teachers to meet with their appraiser to share evidence and good practice. When fully implemented the appraisal process is likely to bring about high levels of professional growth for leaders, teachers and support staff.</p><p>Teachers are committed to the development of trusting and reciprocal relationships. These are well developed and highly evident in the life of the centre. Parent voice is valued. The centre manager along with head teachers are engaging parents in their children's learning, in a variety of ways. A key strategy has been the use of digital technology, which enables parents to have immediate access to information about their child&rsquo;s daily involvement learning and development.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families well. They are vigilant and responsive to children's care needs, and respond to the cues, and non-verbal language of babies, toddlers and young children. Practice is respectful of individual differences.</p><p>The centre manager with support from the professional services manager is working collaboratively with head teachers and teaching staff to develop a more learner-centred curriculum. Parents&rsquo; aspirations have been sought and this has led to a strong dispositional focus in the curriculum. Features of the curriculum that support children are:</p><ul>
<li>a well-integrated early literacy and mathematics learning programme</li>
<li>a strong focus on the natural world</li>
<li>an environment that encourages children to create, explore and be physically challenged</li>
<li>regular excursions into the community to enable children to develop a sense of place</li>
<li>use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori to promote the language, culture and identity of M&#257;ori children to be recognised and valued.</li>
</ul><p>The programme and learning environments closely reflect and align with principles and dispositions of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps are for leaders to work collaboratively with teaching staff, to identify and consistently implement more intentional teaching practices to deepen and extend children's learning and thinking.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Topkids Mount completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Topkids Mount will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>22 December 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
