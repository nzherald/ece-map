</table><p>Te Karaka Preschool requires support to further develop aspects of:</p><ul>
<li>governance and management</li>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>the quality of the programme for infants and toddlers.</li>
</ul><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Karaka Preschool is a small, rural community-based service. It is governed by a voluntary committee, led by two teachers who share the supervisor’s role.</p><p>There is a close whānau connection with most families affiliating to Te Aitanga ā Māhaki.</p><p>The centre was recently relicensed to increase the numbers of children aged up to two from five to eight.</p><p>The Preschool has a positive ERO reporting history. However, most areas identified for development in the February 2012 ERO report have yet to be sufficiently addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre is warm and welcoming. Positive, responsive and reciprocal relationships are formed with families and most are related. This facilitates a strong sense of belonging for both children and whānau.</p><p>The centre has a well-considered, consultatively developed philosophy. It provides an appropriate foundation for programme planning to reflect the community’s shared values and beliefs.</p><p>The children are active learners. They enjoy their time in the centre. They are enquiring and confident and often engage in sustained play. Teachers should provide an appropriate level of challenge to their learning, especially the older children. Children do not have regular access to a full range of learning areas, including arts, carpentry and dramatic play. The teaching of mathematics through play should be more deliberate. Centre routines, such as sleeping and eating, should also be reviewed.</p><p>Most of the children in the centre identify as Māori. There is a strong commitment to meeting the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi although this is not documented in the philosophy. The parent committee should consider <em>Ka Hikitia – Accelerating Success 2013 - 2017</em> to support decisions about how the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi are enacted in this centre. Leaders have identified that the centre’s bicultural programme should be strengthened. They are participating in a professional development programme to improve this key aspect.</p><p>Children’s interests are the basis for planning. The next step is to make a closer link between the assessments documented in the observations and this planning. The learning journals are designed to meet whānau interest. Appropriate photos show the children’s participation in activities. Learning journals should be more consistently used and the children’s culture, language and identity recognised and celebrated within the learning stories.</p><p>The co-supervisors facilitate a team approach and demonstrate a collaborative working relationship with teachers and the community. They have responsibility for the ongoing centre reviews, which have been strengthened since ERO’s 2012 review. There is now a more formalised structure and some well-considered reviews have led to procedural changes and positive outcomes. However, this remains an area for further development.</p><p>Professional leadership should strengthen processes to grow professional teaching practice and facilitate consistency in implementing quality learning programmes. For example, the co-supervisors should review the implementation of the Positive Behaviour Guidelines to ensure all teachers have a clear understanding of this approach.</p><p>In 2012, ERO noted the centre appraisal system needed to be strengthened to facilitate a more consistent approach to teaching. Limited progress has been made. The co-supervisors should seek support to develop a suitable policy and procedures to guide the implementation of a robust process. Annual appraisal for all teachers should be implemented.</p><p>The recent change in the centre licence to enrol more children aged up to two years has prompted the co-supervisors to consider strategies to better cater for this age group. This is an area for development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the co-supervisors have identified the following next steps:</p><ul>
<li>professional leadership should be strengthened</li>
<li>the curriculum should be reviewed so children have regular access to all learning areas</li>
<li>the performance appraisal system needs to be developed, documented and robustly implemented to increase consistency of good teaching practice</li>
<li>increase the evaluation of aspects of the programme and how teachers’ interactions contribute to children’s learning</li>
<li>the centre’s bicultural programme should be strengthened and consideration given to promoting Māori success, as Māori</li>
<li>further develop high quality practices for infants and toddlers.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Karaka Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to the health and safety of the children. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>plan, implement, and evaluate a curriculum that is designed to enhance children’s learning and development through the provision of learning experiences <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, Regulation 43(1)]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<p>the newly constructed gate should be replaced, or modified to meet the regulated height <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008 , Regulation45(2)]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<p>to minimise the hazards to the safety of children, the kitchen area should be secured. <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, Regulations 46(1ciii)]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Karaka Preschool will be within two years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>5 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
