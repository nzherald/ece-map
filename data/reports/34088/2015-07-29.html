</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiwikidz Educare is located in the township of Waihi and is a full-day education and care service, catering for children from birth to school age. The centre operates two age-group learning areas and is licensed for 30 children, including 8 babies under two years of age.</p><p>The centre manager/owner and staff have a documented mission statement that aspires to <em>‘provide quality education and care in a warm, creative’</em>, stimulating environment. The centre manager continues to provide strong educational leadership. She has successfully established a culture of collaboration and mutual support among staff. In addition she maintains positive working relationships with parents, local schools and the community.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2012 leadership and staffing has remained relatively consistent. The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. Teachers have continued to review and improve aspects of centre operations and programme. They have further strengthened children’s portfolios through whole centre professional development in assessment.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed into an inclusive and supportive environment. Children experience trusting, caring and respectful relationships with adults and one another. Teachers are sensitive to children’s physical and emotional wellbeing, and are skilled at using positive guidance strategies to support their social development. Ongoing affirmation and encouragement of children’s efforts and contributions supports them to develop as confident and capable learners.</p><p>Teachers encourage children to be self managing and to take responsibility in daily routines and the programme. Transitions into, within and from the centre are well managed in consultation with parents, and responsive to the emotional and learning needs of children.</p><p>Children participate in a wide range of rich curriculum experiences in the centre, and outings in the local community and schools. Their awareness of the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand is enhanced through hearing and using te reo Māori in conversations, waiata and action songs. Children have visited local schools and participated in local community Matariki celebrations.</p><p>Children initiate their learning in a stimulating and attractive environment that caters for their diverse range of interests and abilities. There are many opportunities for them to participate in creative and imaginative play, which supports their thinking skills, and helps them make sense of the world they live in. A particular feature of the inside and outside environments is the extensive use of natural materials and settings. These environments provide children with many opportunities to interact with, and learn about the natural world.</p><p>Particular strengths in the infant area include the effective implementation of the Pickler theory. Children experience personalised care routines and trusting attachments in calm and unhurried environments where teachers tune into their verbal and non-verbal communication. Older children benefit from the many opportunities to develop friendships and to be engaged in sustained, self-selected learning activities and experiences.</p><p>High quality teaching interactions and strategies support children’s learning. Teachers involve themselves in children’s play, and have conversations that encourage them to problem solve, negotiate, predict and think critically. Literacy, mathematics and science are naturally integrated into children’s play.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families well. They make effective use of this knowledge to plan meaningful activities in response to emerging interests and strengths. High quality individual child portfolios provide a comprehensive record of children’s learning. They are valued, celebrated and often revisited by children, their families and teachers. Useful progress summaries include a valuable record to children’s learning over time.</p><p>The centre manager continues to commit a significant amount of her time to working with children, and role models good practice and high expectations for staff. She has established effective processes for teachers to reflect on their practice with a view of improving outcomes for children. Self-review practices are well established and lead to developments and improvement in centre operations and practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre manager agree that the centre has many affirming practices. The next steps for ongoing development are to continue strengthening practices that promote Māori culture, language and identity.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of KiwiKidz Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of KiwiKidz Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>29 July 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"> ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
