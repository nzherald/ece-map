<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">East Harbour Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">The programme, interactions and environment reflect the values and aspirations written in the kindergarten team philosophy statement. Parents are welcomed warmly. Many stay to share time with their children. Teachers seek and value parent feedback about and input into kindergarten activities. The atmosphere is inclusive and interactions indicate a strong sense of belonging and ownership.</p><p align="left">Relationships are positive and respectful. Teachers are gentle and responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and needs. They make the most of opportunities to support and extend children&rsquo;s learning, engaging in stimulating conversations.</p><p align="left">Children are contented and confident learners who show high levels of cooperation and independence. They are able to persist in their play and establish and maintain relationships with others. Well established routines provide good support for children&rsquo;s developing self-management skills. Expectations for behaviour are clear. The atmosphere is calm and settled.</p><p align="left">The attractive setting invites enthusiastic participation. Both the extensively developed outdoor environment and the indoor area have a wide range of resources for children to access and explore.</p><p align="left">Teachers effectively implement a child-centred programme. They work hard to identify and cater for individuals and different groups of children. The&nbsp;broad curriculum provides for creative and imaginative play and inquiry.</p><p align="left">Early literacy and numeracy development is valued and evident in the programme and environment. Both literacy and numeracy concepts are integrated in meaningful contexts related to play or current interests. Many children competently articulate ideas and share knowledge with others.</p><p align="left">Staff have set appropriate priorities for further development. These include building a team approach to integration of bicultural practices within the programme and increasing understanding of self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of East Harbour Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atEast Harbour Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Since the 2008 ERO review, the kindergarten has been relicensed as a full-day service with a teacher-to-child ratio of one to ten. The teaching team comprises a head teacher and four teachers, one of whom is provisionally registered. Two teachers joined the kindergarten this year. Environment upgrades include considerable development of the outdoor area.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Interactions interactions between teachers and children and among children are positive and respectful. Teachers engage with children warmly and are responsive to recognised interests and needs. They make the most of opportunities to support and extend learning, engaging in stimulating conversations.</p><p align="left">Children are contented and confident learners who show high levels of cooperation and independence. They are able to persist in their play for sustained periods. Well established routines provide good support for children&rsquo;s developing self-management skills. Expectations for behaviour are clear. The atmosphere is calm and settled.</p><p align="left">Environment The attractive environment invites enthusiastic exploration. The extensively developed outdoor and indoor play areas are well resourced. Attention is given to aesthetics, nature and natural materials. Many displays and photographs provide rich opportunities for children and adults to be informed, to reflect on recent work and their participation in kindergarten events. The environment is clearly regarded as a third teacher for children.</p><p align="left">Assessment, planning and evaluation Teachers successfully implement a child-centred programme. They work hard to identify and cater for individuals and different groups of children. The&nbsp;broad curriculum provides for creative and imaginative play and challenging, investigative learning. Teachers use Te Manawa, the criteria for curriculum implementation, to effectively document learning and planning for children. Displays of emerging group activities clearly illustrate the programme in action. Analysis of outcomes shows the learning that has occurred.</p><p align="left">Teachers meet regularly to plan programmes. They share observations, learning stories and their knowledge of children and families. They discuss and record how they will meet, extend and prolong the emerging interests of children.</p><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s profile books are well presented, informative and provide a good record of their learning and involvement in activities. Teacher and child perspectives are evident in written observations that, over time, record skill development, next steps and achievement. Profiles are accessible to children who enjoy looking at these and revisiting previous experiences.</p><p align="left">Literacy and mathematics Early literacy and numeracy learning is valued and celebrated. High quality experiences are interwoven meaningfully through the programme and environment. Many children competently share ideas and knowledge with others.</p><p align="left">Transition to school Children and their families are carefully prepared for transition to school. This includes reciprocal exchanges of teachers, sharing assessment information and children visiting new entrant classes.</p><p align="left">Parent Partnerships An inclusive family atmosphere and community spirit underpin the life of the kindergarten. Parents are warmly welcomed and many stay to spend time with their children. Staff seek and value their feedback about, and input into, kindergarten activities. A strong sense of belonging and ownership is displayed by children, parents and teachers.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">The head teacher and her comparatively new team have set the following priorities:</p><ul>
<li>develop a distributed leadership model to achieve a collaborative culture, building on members&rsquo; strengths</li>
<li>improve bicultural practices particularly supporting a team approach of korero te reo M&#257;ori</li>
<li>enhance understanding of evidence-based self review</li>
<li>continue to explore and investigate ways to increase parent contributions in children&rsquo;s profiles.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation concurs with these directions.</p><h3>Association Support</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p align="left">Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p align="left">The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</li>
<li>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</li>
<li>a wide range of professional development opportunities</li>
<li>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</li>
<li>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice, as a result of feedback</li>
<li>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-east-harbour-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">To the Parents and Community of East Harbour Kindergarten</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on East Harbour Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">East Harbour Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">The programme, interactions and environment reflect the values and aspirations written in the kindergarten team philosophy statement. Parents are welcomed warmly. Many stay to share time with their children. Teachers seek and value parent feedback about and input into kindergarten activities. The atmosphere is inclusive and interactions indicate a strong sense of belonging and ownership.</p><p align="left">Relationships are positive and respectful. Teachers are gentle and responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and needs. They make the most of opportunities to support and extend children&rsquo;s learning, engaging in stimulating conversations.</p><p align="left">Children are contented and confident learners who show high levels of cooperation and independence. They are able to persist in their play and establish and maintain relationships with others. Well established routines provide good support for children&rsquo;s developing self-management skills. Expectations for behaviour are clear. The atmosphere is calm and settled.</p><p align="left">The attractive setting invites enthusiastic participation. Both the extensively developed outdoor environment and the indoor area have a wide range of resources for children to access and explore.</p><p align="left">Teachers effectively implement a child-centred programme. They work hard to identify and cater for individuals and different groups of children. The&nbsp;broad curriculum provides for creative and imaginative play and inquiry.</p><p align="left">Early literacy and numeracy development is valued and evident in the programme and environment. Both literacy and numeracy concepts are integrated in meaningful contexts related to play or current interests. Many children competently articulate ideas and share knowledge with others.</p><p align="left">Staff have set appropriate priorities for further development. These include building a team approach to integration of bicultural practices within the programme and increasing understanding of self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Kathleen Atkins</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Central Region</p></html>
