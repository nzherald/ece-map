<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Nova Montessori Children&rsquo;s House is well placed to promote the wellbeing and positive learning outcomes for children. To sustain the service, the board needs to plan specifically for the future direction of the children&rsquo;s house.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The Nova Montessori Children&rsquo;s House is part of the Nova Montessori School. The centre caters for children aged from 3 to 6 years old and the school for children from 6 to 13 years old. The teachers in the Children&rsquo;s House are qualified and registered.</p><p>The school and children&rsquo;s house are situated in New Brighton. The service and the surrounding areas were significantly affected by the Canterbury earthquakes. The engineers' reports show that the building is safe.</p><p>The Children&rsquo;s House provides good quality education and care. The principals and teachers have made considerable progress in meeting the recommendations in the 2009 ERO report. Self review is affirming good practice and providing direction for further improvements. M&#257;ori families are more involved in the life of the centre. Assessment is providing teachers and parents with more useful information to promote children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are motivated and focus on their learning for extensive periods of time. They work well together and successfully include other children&rsquo;s ideas in their learning.</p><p>Children are well supported by their teachers who make effective use of their knowledge of individual children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers make good use of questions to stimulate thinking and to help children develop their ideas further.</p><p>The environment is designed appropriately to promote children&rsquo;s interests and understandings in literacy and mathematics. The Montessori resources are well presented to help children learn in logical and sequential ways. Children confidently take responsibility for their learning and progress in these areas of the curriculum.</p><p>The curriculum is inclusive of all cultures, particularly the M&#257;ori culture. M&#257;ori families regularly share aspects of their culture in the programme. They actively support teachers and children to develop their knowledge and confidence in te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori.</p><p>Parents are kept well informed about their children&rsquo;s learning. They have many opportunities to learn about the Montessori approach and the ways it benefits their children.</p><p>Strong links between the centre and the school help children to settle easily into the school environment. There is continuity between the centre and school learning and use of resources. Positive relationships between teachers and children and older children on both sites are maintained and developed over time.</p><p>Teachers are well supported by the principals to continue to develop their teaching skills and knowledge and provide positive outcomes for children.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The principals and ERO agree that the next steps for improving children&rsquo;s learning include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening the self-review process to focus more on learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>involving children more in identifying their own progress and learning, particularly in assessment</li>
<li>promoting a bicultural focus in children&rsquo;s assessment practices</li>
<li>refining strategic and annual planning to help the principals promote the ongoing sustainability and growth of the children&rsquo;s house.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nova Montessori Children's House completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to comply with the legal requirements the board must:</p><p>1. develop a system for the regular appraisal of the principals<br><em>Source:</em> <em>47 (GMAT) Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Services 2008</em></p><p>2. ensure that the cabinets in the outdoor area are secured so that they cannot cause damage during an earthquake.<br><em>Source:</em> <em>Regulation 46 Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Services 2008</em></p><p>The principal has taken steps to address these actions since the on-site stage of the review.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h4>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h4><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>Information about the Early Childhood Service</span></h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
