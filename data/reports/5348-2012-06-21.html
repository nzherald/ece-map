<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Discovery Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support, advice and guidance to this teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">Under the leadership of the head teacher, staff have rejuvenated the spacious environment and made the planned programme visible to children and families. The shared values and beliefs expressed in the teaching philosophy form a sound foundation for the programme. These are reinforced and fostered through teachers&rsquo; interactions and the presentation of &lsquo;character stones&rsquo; to children who demonstrate these qualities.</p><p align="left">Children participate keenly in the programme and remain highly engaged for sustained periods. Dramatic role play and creative endeavours feature strongly. The wide range of resources is well organised, easily accessible and reflects children&rsquo;s current interests. Early literacy and mathematical learnings are supported in meaningful ways. The attractive outdoors provides a variety of physical challenges and construction opportunities. Plantings, gardens and natural materials facilitate children&rsquo;s curiosity, exploration and interest in the natural world. These also form part of the kindergarten&rsquo;s focus on sustainable living. Children&rsquo;s learning at the kindergarten, at home and in the community are successfully connected.</p><p align="left">Children are friendly, cooperative and supportive of each other. There are many examples of tuakana/teina with children sharing their knowledge and strengths to assist their peers to succeed. A settled and happy atmosphere prevails. Teachers are warm, positive, nurturing and calm. They engage with children in conversation to effectively support social competence, independence and thinking.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten has strong links to the local community. Parents, specialists and other interested neighbourhood people share their expertise and resources to support children&rsquo;s interests. A programme to support children&rsquo;s transition to school is implemented in partnership with staff from the adjacent primary school. Through this, children become familiar with the new entrant teacher and early literacy practices they will experience in the new environment.</p><p align="left">The teaching team works together to develop their understanding of self review and to extend bicultural practices. While teachers respond to identified interests they acknowledge that the next step is to deepen their focus on the underlying learning to extend this.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Discovery Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Discovery Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association management and support.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The 2008 ERO review identified that the programme was soundly based on topical interests within a rich core curriculum. Community involvement was high. Areas identified for further development included te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori, aspects of assessment practice and spontaneous self review.</p><p align="left">Since 2008 there have been three different head teachers and several changes in the teaching staff. Subsequent teams have worked to strengthen the areas noted above. The current team has a balance of new and experienced teachers who have been working together since term four 2011.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten operating hours were reorganised in term four, 2010 to closely align to the school day. Older children attend for three of these full days and younger children on the other two.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left"><strong>Programme.</strong> Children are highly engaged in activities they choose, for sustained periods. Dramatic role play and creative endeavours feature strongly. Early literacy and mathematical learnings are successfully supported in meaningful contexts. Kindergarten routines effectively foster children&rsquo;s social skills, self responsibility and oral literacy.</p><p align="left">The shared values and beliefs expressed through the recently developed teaching philosophy are clearly evident in practice. They form a foundation for the programme, teachers&rsquo; interactions and their aspirations and expectations for children. The philosophy is visually depicted for families and shows careful consideration given to the kindergarten&rsquo;s locality. Good levels of professional discussion and constructive feedback between team members assist in shared understandings and enhanced practice.</p><p align="left">A responsive programme results from teachers daily discussions about children&rsquo;s play and interests. This informs the provision of additional experiences, resources or excursions to broaden children&rsquo;s learning. Prominent displays show how the programme evolves. Good links are made between children&rsquo;s learning at the kindergarten, at home and in the community. Detailed evaluations provide an overall summary of what was provided including some group learning.</p><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s participation in a wide variety of experiences is recorded in their colourful individual portfolios. These are easily and regularly accessed by children and their families. Parents&rsquo; genuine contributions and shared aspirations for their child&rsquo;s learning provide an added richness to complement teachers&rsquo; narrative stories.</p><p align="left"><strong>Environment.</strong> Teachers have worked hard to rejuvenate the spacious environment and make the programme visible to children and families. As a result the wide range of resources is well organised, easily accessible to children and reflects their current interests. The attractive outdoors provides a variety of physical challenges and construction opportunities. Plantings, many different gardens and a good selection of natural materials foster children&rsquo;s curiosity, exploration and interest in the natural world.</p><p align="left"><strong>Interactions.</strong> Children are friendly, cooperative and supportive of each other. There are many examples of tuakana/teina with children sharing their knowledge and strengths to assist their peers to succeed. A settled and happy atmosphere prevails.</p><p align="left">Teachers are warm, positive, nurturing and calm. They engage with children in conversation to effectively support social competence and independence. Questions are well used to promote children&rsquo;s thinking.</p><p align="left"><strong>Self review.</strong> The teaching team is working together to develop their understanding of self review. They follow a sound process that is improvement focused. The impact of change is evaluated in a targeted way.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left"><strong>Programme.</strong> Teachers have identified, and ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation confirms, that the further integration of bicultural perspectives into the programme and teachers&rsquo; interactions would better reflect the commitment articulated in their teaching philosophy.</p><p align="left">While teachers respond to the identified interests of children they acknowledge that the next step is to deepen their focus on the underlying learning to extend this.</p><p align="left"><strong>Assessment</strong>. Teachers have identified that further development of their assessment practices will better support children&rsquo;s learning and progress. Deeper analysis and stronger links between portfolio entries should assist teachers identify strategies to further challenge and extend children&rsquo;s thinking.</p><p align="left"><strong>Self review</strong>. Teachers have identified that self review is in the early stages of development. Further depth is required at each stage of the process to better inform decisions and have a stronger impact on improving outcomes for children.</p><h3>Association Support</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p align="left">Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p align="left">The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</li>
<li>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</li>
<li>a wide range of professional development opportunities</li>
<li>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</li>
<li>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice, as a result of feedback</li>
<li>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Discovery Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre Management Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-discovery-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Discovery Kindergarten</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Discovery Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Discovery Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support, advice and guidance to this teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">Under the leadership of the head teacher, staff have rejuvenated the spacious environment and made the planned programme visible to children and families. The shared values and beliefs expressed in the teaching philosophy form a sound foundation for the programme. These are reinforced and fostered through teachers&rsquo; interactions and the presentation of &lsquo;character stones&rsquo; to children who demonstrate these qualities.</p><p align="left">Children participate keenly in the programme and remain highly engaged for sustained periods. Dramatic role play and creative endeavours feature strongly. The wide range of resources is well organised, easily accessible and reflects children&rsquo;s current interests. Early literacy and mathematical learnings are supported in meaningful ways. The attractive outdoors provides a variety of physical challenges and construction opportunities. Plantings, gardens and natural materials facilitate children&rsquo;s curiosity, exploration and interest in the natural world. These also form part of the kindergarten&rsquo;s focus on sustainable living. Children&rsquo;s learning at the kindergarten, at home and in the community are successfully connected.</p><p align="left">Children are friendly, cooperative and supportive of each other. There are many examples of tuakana/teina with children sharing their knowledge and strengths to assist their peers to succeed. A settled and happy atmosphere prevails. Teachers are warm, positive, nurturing and calm. They engage with children in conversation to effectively support social competence, independence and thinking.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten has strong links to the local community. Parents, specialists and other interested neighbourhood people share their expertise and resources to support children&rsquo;s interests. A programme to support children&rsquo;s transition to school is implemented in partnership with staff from the adjacent primary school. Through this, children become familiar with the new entrant teacher and early literacy practices they will experience in the new environment.</p><p align="left">The teaching team works together to develop their understanding of self review and to extend bicultural practices. While teachers respond to identified interests they acknowledge that the next step is to deepen their focus on the underlying learning to extend this.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Joyce Gebbie</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Central Region (Acting)</p></html>
