</table><p>Milson Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Milson Kindergarten is located in Palmerston North. Opening hours are Monday to Friday from 8:45am until 2:45pm. Full day places are available to children from two to six years. At the time of this review, there were 49 children enrolled and 13 identify as Māori.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy emphasises valuing tamariki and whānau and providing an environment with a focus on relationships, sustainability and positive learning experiences.</p><p>The kindergarten is administered by the Ruahine Kindergarten Association (the association). The governing board is responsible for setting the overall strategic direction for the organisation. The day-to-day running of the association is the role of the chief executive officer who is responsible to the board. An operations manager supports the service’s compliance and policy development. Two senior teachers provide educational leadership across the teaching teams.</p><p>The May 2016 ERO report identified that strengthening the understanding and use of internal evaluation was required. Progress has been made but some aspects remain a focus for further strengthening.</p><p>This kindergarten is part of the Palmerston North East Kāhui Ako and a member of the Enviroschools programme.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of twelve kindergartens and one early learning service in the Ruahine Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are supported to lead their own learning and confidently engage in a programme that promotes authentic and meaningful learning experiences. The environment is thoughtfully arranged to encourage physical challenge, exploration, challenge and discovery. Care and respect for each other and the environment are modelled by teachers.</p><p>Teachers work alongside children to promote their independence and social and emotional competencies. Intentional teaching builds on their skills and knowledge. Teachers' respectful and collaborative practices result in a calm, nurturing environment where children, parents and families feel welcome.</p><p>Teachers have strengthened assessment for learning. An on-line programme supports improved parent and whānau communication about children's plans, progress and achievements. As the result of a recent review, teachers are strengthening parent contribution to this process to enable teachers to more intentionally plan towards meeting these aspirations. Children are able to see themselves as valued learners through their individual learning portfolios.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively to identify individual goals to inform planning and extension of children's emerging strengths, interests and dispositions. Further evaluation of the impact of teaching strategies and curriculum decisions on children's learning should strengthen outcomes for children. Ensuring that assessment and planning, and therefore the curriculum, meaningfully acknowledges children's culture and language is a key next step.</p><p>A commitment to implementing culturally responsive practice is evident. Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are incorporated into the programme. Teachers continue to build their knowledge and understanding of strategies that promote educational success for Māori children.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to the individual needs of all learners. They advocate for children and work in collaboration with families and external agencies to help children who require additional learning support, progress towards their individual goals.</p><p>A well-considered transition process supports children's entry to school. The kindergarten has established relationships with the local school where information is exchanged and regular visits help children to become familiar with the school environment.</p><p>Senior teachers work collaboratively to build teacher and leadership capability. There is a strong commitment to growing staff knowledge and skills through ongoing professional learning, research opportunities and the sharing of good practice.</p><p>A range of collaboratively undertaken reviews, aligned to kindergarten and association priorities for ongoing improvement, emphasise children's learning. Strengthening teachers' knowledge of evaluation to support them to know the impact of their actions on children's outcomes is an ongoing development.</p><p>Association leaders have a well-considered approach to progressing strategic objectives. Robust systems and processes are in place for reporting, monitoring and evaluating the quality of operations. Information is used to inform decision making and to improve the quality of teaching and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At kindergarten level, priorities are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers' understanding and use of internal evaluation focused on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>responsiveness to children's cultures and languages and promoting success for Māori learners as Māori.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>At the governance level, the Ruahine Kindergarten Association have identified that their priorities are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen and build their knowledge and understanding of tikanga Māori and seek engagement with local iwi with kaumatua support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support Milson Kindergarten to embed internal evaluation for improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Milson Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>27 November 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
