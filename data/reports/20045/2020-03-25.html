</table><p>Edmonton Community Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edmonton Community Kindergarten is located behind the Te Atatu South Community Centre. It is a not for profit incorporated and charitable society. The kindergarten was established over 50 years ago to serve children and families in the local community.</p><p>The kindergarten is licensed for up to 30 children between two and five years of age. In 2018 the licence was amended to increase the hours and provide flexible attendance options. Children can attend all day, morning or afternoon sessions, Monday to Friday. Children and families come from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds. A third of children who attend the kindergarten are Māori.</p><p>The kindergarten's philosophy emphasises the right of all children to attend high quality and affordable early childhood education. It promotes partnership with parents, whānau and the community and reflects Aotearoa New Zealand's bicultural partnership and commitment to the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The kindergarten is managed by a group of parents who are elected annually. The management committee works collaboratively with early childhood educators and delegates day-to-day management of the centre to the experienced head teacher.</p><p>Since ERO's 2015 review the kindergarten introduced an online platform to record and communicate children's learning to parents and whānau. The outside sandpit area has been redesigned and refurbished. The head teacher and other full-time teachers are qualified and registered with a new teaching team of two teachers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are supported to be confident and competent learners. They settle quickly on arrival and are warmly welcomed by teachers. They lead the direction of their play based on their interests. Children have easy access to high quality resources and move freely between indoor and outdoor areas. They enthusiastically explore and investigate the spacious outdoor environment.</p><p>Interactions between teachers and children are positive and respectful. Children are well supported by teachers to be independent and develop their social skills. Teachers value and encourage a play-based programme that reflects the learning outcomes in the curriculum. Children actively initiate and engage in meaningful, sustained and purposeful play.</p><p>The kindergarten has strong connections to and highly respects parents, whānau and the community. Teachers know parents and whānau well. Teachers actively support the identity, language, and culture of the children and families.</p><p>Teachers' commitment to embedding te reo Maori and te ao Māori in the programme is evident. They continue to build their knowledge, capability and confidence with bicultural practice to continue to support ongoing positive outcomes for Māori children.</p><p>The head teacher and new teaching team meet regularly to plan and work collaboratively. Teachers have good opportunities for ongoing quality professional development. It is timely to consider ways to strengthen leadership opportunities for teachers in curriculum planning and assessment.</p><p>Internal evaluation is well embedded and is focused on positive outcomes for children and the ongoing sustainability of the kindergarten. The strategic plan and annual plan guide the future direction of the centre. Policies and procedures are regularly updated. The management committee are committed to the philosophy of the kindergarten and actively support equitable access to learning opportunities for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening curriculum planning and assessment systems by focusing on children's individual learning dispositions, interests and strengths</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to grow the teaching team by promoting leadership opportunities and building teacher capability.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edmonton Community Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>25 March 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
