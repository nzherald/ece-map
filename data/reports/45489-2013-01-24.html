<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Red Hill Kindergarten is very well placed to continue to promote positive outcomes for children. A sound framework of high quality professional support has enabled this reflective and committed team of teachers to quickly build effective teaching and learning programmes.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Red Hill Kindergarten in Papakura is part of the Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association (CMKA). The Association&rsquo;s clear vision sets the direction for the kindergarten. Strategies to achieve this vision include responsiveness to wh&#257;nau contributions and bicultural practices. The Association has a commitment to high quality care and education.</p><p>Red Hill Kindergarten has been established within the last three years. It provides school-day sessions for children from the local community. Some children are under three years of age when they enrol and several families have more than one child in the kindergarten. A significant number of boys attend at present. The majority of children are of M&#257;ori heritage.</p><p>The teaching team has been together since September 2012. Since then they have built good working relationships and have developed shared goals. Their primary goal has been to develop strong relationships with their community. These relationships aim to encourage both parents and children to develop a sense of well-being and belonging in the kindergarten, and are beginning to be successfully realised.</p><p>The previous building on this site has been substantially altered to accommodate the kindergarten. The new building is spacious, and the playgrounds are well developed to provide for a variety of activities and experiences.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in six early childhood education services within the Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association (CMKA) umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten is well governed and managed. Professional support for the well qualified team of registered teachers is ongoing and useful. Specific initiatives and personnel in both the Association and kindergarten promote te reo me on&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori and are strengthening children&rsquo;s understanding about te ao M&#257;ori.</p><p>Teachers use the Association&rsquo;s vision as a starting point for their teaching and learning statement. This statement expresses teachers&rsquo; shared intentions for children. Teachers&rsquo; work with children has made a marked difference to children&rsquo;s sense of belonging and their willingness to engage with the programme.</p><p>The Association&rsquo;s professional practice manager (PPM) team leads teachers in ongoing reflections about the quality of the kindergarten practices. Teachers are well positioned to continue developing self review processes that inform their practice.</p><p>Effective and well informed leadership within the team helps teachers to reflect meaningfully about their work and to identify the best ways of supporting children&rsquo;s learning. Dedicated, professional teachers continuously update their own knowledge and learning about new advances in teaching practice. Their highly inclusive teaching practices are ensuring that the programme is successfully guiding learning for these children.</p><p>Teachers&rsquo; relationships and interactions with children are a strength of the kindergarten. Children are settled, busy and highly engaged with activities and each other. Teachers&rsquo; emphasis on respect for self, others and resources is evident in children&rsquo;s friendships and in their collaborative play. They are helpful, kind and generous in their play. The good quality resources are well maintained. Children are careful with and enthusiastic in their use of the wide range of resources that teachers provide.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s interests and ideas often guide the direction of the programme. Teachers use skilful questioning and provide additional information to increase children&rsquo;s problem-solving skills and deepen their thinking. Teachers incorporate literacy, mathematics and science concepts into the programme in meaningful ways. Children respond very positively to the programme.</p><p>Teachers know children, their wh&#257;nau and backgrounds well. Teachers&rsquo; respectful relationships with wh&#257;nau have strengthened their trust and respect for the work that teachers do with children. Teachers&rsquo; calm, non-judgemental interactions with wh&#257;nau promote the sense that everyone has a place in the centre. Teachers intend to continue following CMKA&rsquo;s direction with regard to inviting and responding to contributions from wh&#257;nau.</p><p>The kindergarten receives equity funding to assist with providing for children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers have used this funding well to provide high quality resources and to partly fund many excursions. Such excursions provide additional learning and a broader perspective for children, and are greatly enjoyed by children and their wh&#257;nau.</p><p>As a new team, teachers have undertaken professional development to help them with planning and assessment processes. Teachers are committed to continuing to strengthen and embed new assessment, planning and evaluation processes. Children&rsquo;s portfolios are attractive and provide wh&#257;nau with a clear picture of children&rsquo;s learning and interests over time.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Red Hill Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>25 January 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
