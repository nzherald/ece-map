<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Pukekohe High School Childcare Centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Pukekohe High School Childcare Centre is situated in purpose-built premises alongside the Pukekohe High School playing fields. It provides for children of the school&rsquo;s teaching staff as well as for the wider community and is operated by the committee of an incorporated society. Some members of the committee have been involved with the centre for many years. The manager and most of the teaching staff are also long serving. As well as a strong sense of community, there is a sense of stability and continuity in the centre.</p><p>The manager and teachers have established relationships with a local Puna Reo to provide mutual support, and to increase teachers&rsquo; awareness of bicultural practices. The centre is also involved in Te Huarahi, a local schools initiative to promote education success for M&#257;ori children. Relationships with local schools&rsquo; new entrant classes and with the adjacent high school support seamless transitions. Visits and excursions, including regular swimming lessons, build links for children with the wider community.</p><p>Since ERO&rsquo;s 2009 review, the centre has been adapted to provide a separate room for children up to the age of two years with an adjacent sleep room, and outside areas. This change has also enabled staff to make some improvements in the main play area for older children.</p><p>ERO&rsquo;s reports about the centre have been consistently positive. The manager used ERO&rsquo;s 2009 recommendations to identify staff professional development needs and guide improvements in the centre. Some good progress has been made. However, key suggestions from ERO relating to curriculum implementation and the impact of adults&rsquo; routines have yet to be satisfactorily addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Promoting a sense of belonging for children and their families has been a longstanding strength of the centre. The committee represents and includes parents of children enrolled in the centre. Parent contributions to management, centre programmes, and in their children&rsquo;s assessment records are encouraged and welcomed. Managers and teachers are responsive to information and suggestions gathered through parent surveys. Good communication systems have been established.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy statements clearly identify priorities relating to the principles of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki,</em> the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, providing a safe environment, and promoting learning through children&rsquo;s emerging interests and child-initiated play. Teachers and parents value opportunities for children&rsquo;s exploration in the outdoors. Older children make good use of the extensive outdoor play area, using resources that reflect the semi-rural Pukekohe community.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years benefit from having a primary caregiver. The caregivers' focus on effective and respectful practices is based on well-established theories of care and education for infants and toddlers. These children have opportunities to mix with their older peers and siblings, in keeping with the family-oriented nature of the centre.</p><p>High quality learning stories, particularly for younger children, show teachers&rsquo; very good knowledge of children&rsquo;s individual characteristics, strengths and interests. An effective model has been established for recording how teachers have supported specific interests and helped them to evolve over time. Teachers continue to work with an external adviser to enhance these useful programme planning practices.</p><p>ERO&rsquo;s earlier reports have noted that systems for management and self-review were well established. Examples of recent reviews and good quality meeting records show that teachers continue to refine their processes and are developing reflective practices that contribute to improvement. Parents have good opportunities to contribute to the centre's review processes.</p><p>It would now be beneficial for the manager and supervisor to work with teachers to review centre practices against the centre&rsquo;s philosophy statements and indicators of best practice to:</p><ul>
<li>reduce the extent to which centre routines and practices intrude on children&rsquo;s ability to sustain their focus on learning, persist in solving problems and create more complex play</li>
<li>increase the depth of conversations with children, the consistency of skilful responses and purposeful support for children's engagement in learning</li>
<li>consider ways to enrich the learning environment.</li>
</ul><p>The committee could strengthen its governance role by leading strategic thinking and planning, and establishing expectations for working towards centre goals for development. Clearer links between strategic goals, specific management planning and reporting would support the development of self review and quality assurance at the governance level. A greater focus on children&rsquo;s learning in strategic planning, reporting and self review would help the manager and teachers to sustain and build on current good practices.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pukekohe High School Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice, the manager and teachers should increase their vigilance in identifying and minimising or removing hazards in the environment</p><p>The manager should adapt staff rosters, responsibilities and practices so that:</p><ul>
<li>supervision ratios are maintained at all times and staff can focus their attention on supporting children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>the teacher responsible for children up to the age of two is not alone with this group of children for significant periods.</li>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
