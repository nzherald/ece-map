</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Nestlings Preschool is a privately owned education centre that is located in Tauranga and provides education and care for children over the age of two. It is licensed for 30 children and has a current roll of 40 including three children who identify as Māori. Nestlings Preschool is staffed by five qualified teachers and two support staff. The service provides children with the opportunity to learn, understand and embrace Christian values.</p><p>Since the last ERO review management has redesigned the layout of the centre rooms. The roll has increased the number of children from 25 to 30 places and staffing has remained stable. The centre responded positively to the 2011 ERO report by strengthening their staff appraisal progress and enhancing programme planning.</p><p>Centre philosophy highlights their commitment to honour and implement Christian principles. Teachers’ practices contribute to a nurturing environment that supports children to grow into confident and competent learners.</p><p>Policies and procedures are in place to assist with the provision of a safe physical and emotional learning environment for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre owner and head teacher are knowledgeable and demonstrate a highly professional approach to their leadership and management roles and responsibilities. They are committed to implementing effective self-review and employer practices. Shared leadership is a focus of the team approach to teaching, planning and aspects of centre operations. Effective communication and open relationships between management and teachers contribute to the successful operation of the service and positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Self review is well understood and leads to evidence-based decision making. Processes are both formal and informal and ongoing reflection highlights successes and identifies future challenges. Sustained professional learning in self review has enhanced the way a bicultural perspective is implemented in the centre.</p><p>Teachers continue to provide high quality education and care. Effective assessment, planning and evaluation are enabling teachers to plan interesting, stimulating and appropriately challenging learning opportunities. Children have many opportunities to develop literacy and numeracy skills appropriate to their developmental stages of learning. Diversity is celebrated and adults model social competencies and values such as cooperation, respect, inclusion and fairness.</p><p>The teaching team works collaboratively and has created a positive working environment. Staff recognise the individual skills and expertise that each bring to support the organisation of the preschool. This teamwork enables the centre to focus on growth and ongoing improvement. Teachers feel valued and willingly contribute their individual strengths, talents and ideas to enhance the programme for children.</p><p>High quality resources are plentiful, attractively presented and easily accessed by children. The design of the building facilitates a free flow of movement between indoor and outdoor activities. Teachers have established a calm, peaceful and constructive climate where children problem solve, take risks and experience success. Children are increasingly able to make decisions, pursue interests and direct their own learning. The welcoming atmosphere and arrangement of activities and equipment promotes an environment that values children and their families.</p><p>Teachers’ interactions with children are sensitive and respectful. They know children well and respond to individual needs and interests. Respectful relationships are developed and maintained. Teachers listen carefully to children, value their contributions and model social behaviours that encourage children to cooperate and negotiate. Children are gaining interpersonal skills that enable them to form friendships as contributing members of the centre.</p><p>The preschool has maintained effective and supportive processes for assisting children and their families with the transition to school. The extension programme includes an emphasis on developing children’s early literacy and mathematical skills. Children are confident and prepared to move through to the next stage of their learning.</p><p>There is a strong partnership between the centre, its families and the community. Parents have many opportunities to be well informed about their child’s learning and centre activities. Children benefit from the close relationship between home, the centre and the community.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre management and ERO agree that important next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to integrate te reo and tikanga Māori into centre programmes</li>
<li>access an external appraiser for the management team.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nestlings Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Nestlings Preschool will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>21 November 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
