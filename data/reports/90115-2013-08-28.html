</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Montessori @ Arrowtown (formerly ABC Arrowtown Montessori) provides care and education for children from birth-to-five years between 9am and 3:30pm each day. For older children, the programme closely follows the Montessori approach. This means that the children often work individually or in pairs with Montessori designed equipment on a range of learning activities. Some parents choose to enrol their children in weekly French and ‘play-ball’ classes.</p><p>Younger children play and learn in an adjacent building. Each child has a teacher who takes a special interest in his/her care and learning. Some aspects of the Montessori approach to learning are included in their day.</p><p>Since the last ERO review, the centre has been purchased by Kidicorp. A centre manager is responsible for the day-to-day management. Over time, Kidicorp has increased its level of support for the centre manager and other staff. Most teachers are qualified and have worked at the centre for some time.</p><p>The centre manager and teachers have made positive changes in response to ERO’s last report. They are continuing to work on some areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre is well resourced with Montessori and other equipment. Resources are well presented at the children’s height. The children are very respectful of the centre’s resources and environment, and carefully tidy away each activity. Many children have formed good friendships at the centre. The teachers take time to talk with parents about their child’s learning and to seek feedback about centre programmes.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy is very evident in the way that teachers work with the children. For example, children:</p><ul>
<li>show respect for each other, the centre resources and environment</li>
<li>learn in a calm, caring and orderly environment</li>
<li>are encouraged to take responsibility for themselves and their learning.</li>
</ul><p>The children in both areas are very settled. The older children confidently select activities, find an area to work in, and then focus on their task. Most teachers are careful to let a child attempt the task independently. They help and encourage the child to think more deeply about the activity when appropriate.</p><p>There is a strong focus on real-life skills and children taking responsibility. For example, for morning tea, children select, cut and serve their own food. When hungry, each child finds a plate, chooses what they would like to eat and drink, sits with friends at the table, then clears and washes his/her plates.</p><p>Other good practices that ERO noted include:</p><ul>
<li>children and teachers enjoying sustained conversations with each other</li>
<li>teachers using open questions to challenge children’s thinking</li>
<li>teachers valuing children’s different language, cultural and religious backgrounds</li>
<li>children having many opportunities to enjoy early literacy and mathematics learning.</li>
</ul><p>In the infant area, ERO observed sensitive and caring relationships between the teachers and children. The teachers plan interesting sensory and tactile experiences, such as investigating ice, to support children’s learning and development. The children’s care needs are well met.</p><p>Some teachers show special skill in the way they observe and assess children’s learning and build on this. Others show strength in the way they use te reo Māori and bring in a Māori dimension.</p><p>The Kidicorp organisation has useful guidelines to help teachers in their work and ensure the smooth operation of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager, teachers and ERO agree that their next steps are to continue to review and improve:</p><ul>
<li>how they assess and plan for individuals and groups of children</li>
<li>how they integrate te reo Māori and learning about aspects of Māori culture into children’s learning.</li>
</ul><p>The centre manager and teachers need to build a shared understanding of effective self review. This will help them evaluate how well the desired teaching and management practices are in place and what could be improved.</p><p>The centre manager and staff need to develop long and short term (strategic and annual) plans that clearly set out what the centre’s priorities are and how these will be achieved. Professional learning and appraisal goals should link to this.</p><p>It is timely for Kidicorp, as a new employer, to survey the staff.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Montessori @ Arrowtown completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist.</p><p>In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>administration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health, safety and welfare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>personnel management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>financial and property management.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO noted several areas where the service could improve its practices. In particular, teachers need to improve the way they monitor sleeping children in the nursery area. They also need to ensure that all staff carefully follow the centre’s health and safety procedures at all times.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Montessori @ Arrowtown will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>28 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
