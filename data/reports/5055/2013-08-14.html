</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Highland Park Kindergarten has a history of positive ERO reports. The kindergarten in East Auckland, provides education and care for children over two years of age, and operates under the Kindergarten Day Model. Some children stay for the whole day and others for the morning session. There are four fully qualified teachers, a teacher assistant, an administrator and a teacher aide. Specialist teachers in technology and yoga contribute to the richness of the programme.</p><p>The Kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA). The association provides policy, procedural and operating guidelines. It also provides teachers with regular, topical professional development and on-going support from professional managers.</p><p>ERO’s 2010 report commented on teachers' high quality interactions and noted how programmes were driven by children’s interests. Very good teaching practices have been maintained and teachers have further strengthened partnerships with families and their community. Teachers have continued to review and enhance the learning environment with children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers’ shared philosophy is evident in the provision of a high quality, child-led programme. The curriculum is underpinned by the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, bicultural practices and partnerships with parents and whānau. Children’s ideas and parents’ aspirations are sought and valued. Opportunities for children to take on leadership are reflected in programme documents and children’s portfolios. The culture of child-initiated planning is embedded in the programme.</p><p>Teachers are inclusive and culturally responsive. They celebrate cultural diversity and the knowledge their families bring to the centre. Their respectful interactions, high expectations and sustained conversations contribute to children being confident, capable learners. They honour children’s work, foster their strengths and nurture their interests. Teachers are reflective, innovative, and value ongoing professional development. They are committed to children being empowered in their learning.</p><p>Children learn in a stimulating, well resourced learning environment that supports their sustained engagement in play and learning. They have many opportunities to experience literacy, numeracy, science and technology in play and meaningful activities. Children play cooperatively, show empathy for others and have leadership opportunities. Teachers foster children’s creativity, curiosity and problem solving abilities. Children are eager to try things out, learn and discover.</p><p>Teachers work collegially and benefit from strong professional leadership. They are also encouraged to be leaders. The AKA appraisal system provides opportunities for teachers to reflect on and refine their practice. The Association encourages teachers to engage in professional development and share good teaching practices with others.</p><p>Teachers continuously consider further ways to promote positive outcomes for children. Teachers have worked collaboratively with whānau Māori to acknowledge the place of Māori as tangata whenua and to nurture Māori children’s sense of identity. Sound systems for self review guide teaching practice and inform programme improvements. Teachers agree that they could now enhance their self review by making the depth of their thinking and the multiple perspectives that contribute to self review more visible.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teaching team are eager to continue exploring further ways to:</p><ul>
<li>show their responses to whānau aspirations in children’s assessment records</li>
<li>enhance transition to school partnerships and practices</li>
<li>support children to write their own learning stories.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Highland Park Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Highland Park Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>14 August 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></li>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><ul>

<li><span>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</span></li>
<li>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</li>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">on ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
