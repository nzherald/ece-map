</table><p>With ongoing targeted support from the association, Johnsonville Full Day Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Johnsonville Full Day Kindergarten is a full day education and care centre situated close to Johnsonville shopping area and local schools. Children attending reflect a diverse range of cultures, including, Māori, Indian, Asian and Samoan. At the time of this review, Māori learners make up over half the roll.</p><p>The kindergarten is one of 85 kindergartens and three home-based education and care networks governed and managed by He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). This is a new kindergarten association created from joining the Rimutaka and Wellington Kindergarten Associations in 2014. The transition to the new association is expected to be a three-year process.</p><p>The board and managers provide governance for the organisation. Senior teachers have delegated kindergartens. Their role is to provide regular support and a range of professional learning and development opportunities for teachers.</p><p>All teachers at Johnsonville Full Day Kindergarten are qualified and registered. They are an established group, with many having been at the kindergarten for some time. In early 2015, a new senior head teacher was appointed. The recently revised centre philosophy emphasises the importance of a welcoming, inclusive environment, valuing parents as children’s first teachers, and recognising the strengths and interests of individual children.</p><p>The April 2012 ERO report for Johnsonville Full Day Kindergarten identified at centre level that planned self review, and use of te reo Māori needed further development. Areas where the Wellington Kindergarten Association needed to strengthen its support for teachers were also identified. Improvement continues to be needed in some of these areas that the association has plans to address. These feature as key next steps in this report. The alignment of individual kindergartens' annual plans with the association’s strategic priorities has now been addressed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 16 kindergarten reviews in He Whānau Manaaki Kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>In 2012, the association developed a framework to guide the implementation of its curriculum, Te Manawa. This document outlines criteria for curriculum delivery including expectations for assessment and planning for children’s learning.</p><p>Johnsonville Kindergarten’s curriculum needs further development to be more responsive to all learners. ERO agrees with leaders that revisiting Te Manawa should help support teachers to build consistency of high quality teaching and shared team understanding of current approaches to assessment, planning, and evaluation.</p><p>Children make decisions about their learning, and show a positive sense of belonging. Their independence and self-help skills are encouraged. ERO observed some examples of older children supporting younger children in their play.</p><p>Relationships are affirming and responsive. Teachers are responsive to children’s needs and interests. Parents are made to feel welcome. There is a range of ways families are informed of the kindergarten happenings. There are established links in the community, including with local schools.</p><p>Children with additional learning and teaching needs are well supported in the inclusive programme.</p><p>Teachers are at the early stages of inquiring into aspects of their practice. These review processes require further development. Next steps in self review and evaluation to guide decisions for improvement to teaching and learning are to:</p><ul>
<li>make use of an evaluative question, and strengthen indicators of high quality practice</li>
<li>gather more evidence and deepen the analysis of this information</li>
<li>have more in-depth evaluation of outcomes of children's learning.</li>
</ul><p>The senior teacher provides termly written reports that outline agreed development priorities and progress in relation to the quality of teaching and learning. The association has recently implemented new reports that should more deliberately focus on outcomes for children, teacher and leader performance. ERO's evaluation affirms this development.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified that the association needed to improve the appraisal processes. This continues to require strengthening. A recently revised appraisal model, yet to be implemented, includes: more focused goals that build teacher and leader capability; more regular and targeted feedback and feed forward about teaching practice; and clearer links with the Registered Teacher Criteria.</p><p>Children have some opportunities to learn about Aotearoa New Zealand’s dual cultural heritage. Teachers and leaders acknowledge that they need to build their capability to be responsive to Māori children’s culture, language and identity. This development should include establishing relationships with mana whenua and making use of Ministry of Education resources such as, <em>Ka Hikitia  Accelerating Success</em> <em>2013 - 2017</em> and <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners.</em></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher, senior head teacher, staff, and ERO agree on the following key next steps. They should:</p><ul>
<li>develop shared understanding and their use of self review</li>
<li>improve aspects of assessment and programme planning</li>
<li>promote further ways for Māori to achieve success as Māori, and Pacific learners to achieve success as Pacific.</li>
</ul><p>ERO affirms the intent of leaders to develop an action plan to address the key areas for improvement identified in this report.</p><p>The senior management team of He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua should continue to further improve processes for growing and developing the practice of teachers, head teachers and senior teachers. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>improvements to the quality and monitoring of individual kindergartens and regular implementation of a robust appraisal system.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Johnsonville Full Day Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Johnsonville Full Day Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>17 June 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
