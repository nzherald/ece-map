The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left"><span>St Kilda Kindergarten is one of 22 early childhood services operating under the umbrella of Dunedin Kindergartens (DK).

Children can attend a mix of whole or part-day sessions.</span></p><p align="left">Children play and learn in spacious and well-equipped indoor and outdoor environments.

Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The St Kilda Kindergarten aims to offer children a safe, happy and healthy learning environment where families and community are welcomed. Teachers intend for children to learn to respect each other and care for the environment.</p><h4>Areas of strength&nbsp;</h4><p align="left">Children enjoy playing and learning in a safe environment. They have a variety of well-equipped areas for wet and dry weather. They have a wide range of resources that support them in their play. The outdoor area is particularly popular and reflects the programme&rsquo;s emphasis on valuing the local, coastal environment.&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Children and parents are made to feel welcome. ERO observed respectful and caring relationships between the teachers, parents and children. The teachers take time to interact with the parents and to get to know the children and their families well. Parents regularly share information and wishes for their children&rsquo;s learning with teachers.&nbsp;</p><p align="left">The new teaching team is working well together. The kindergarten routines are efficiently managed with children moving freely between group times and individual play.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p align="left">The teaching team&rsquo;s next steps are to strengthen aspects of self review through:</p><ul>
<li>improving processes and systems for assessment</li>
<li>developing indicators to improve the quality of teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Teachers have discussed their philosophy in terms of what this means for them and the kindergarten programme. They now need to define what high expectations for children&rsquo;s learning looks like. This will assist teachers and senior leaders in making visible their strategies and approaches for supporting high quality teaching and learning.</p><p align="left">Children enjoy looking at their profile books and revisiting them. Each child&rsquo;s learning priority and the way this is evaluated, built on and linked needs to be made clearer.</p><p align="left">The teachers regularly incorporate te reo M&#257;ori within group times. They occasionally use te reo M&#257;ori and other languages in their interactions with individual children. A next step is to review how to extend their use of te reo M&#257;ori and other languages throughout the programme.</p><p align="left">The previous teaching team had made a useful start to reviewing the effectiveness of centre programmes. The review guidelines could be further developed to help improve the quality of self review.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of St Kilda Kindergarten completed an ERO and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years. When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p></html>
