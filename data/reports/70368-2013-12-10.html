</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Amberley Community Preschool is located in the rural town of Amberley in North Canterbury. The centre is a not-for-profit community-based early childhood education service. A dedicated parent committee works collaboratively with the senior teacher and teaching team to provide positive outcomes for children from six months to five years old. The centre has a separate area for children under two years old.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO review, a number of changes have occurred. Many of these have taken place within the last 12 months. These include:</p><ul>
<li>renaming the centre to better reflect its close connections to the community</li>
<li>relicensing the preschool under the Education (Early Childhood) 2008 regulations</li>
<li>restructuring priority roles and responsibilities for staff to give children and their families greater consistency of care and education</li>
<li>refurbishing the inside environment to create purposeful and interesting learning areas</li>
<li>building an additional centre to relieve the pressure on the waiting list.</li>
</ul><p>The centre is now looking forward to consolidating these changes and building on the provision of education and care it offers for the learning community.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders and teachers actively foster positive, respectful and inclusive relationships with children, parents and whānau. All children are treated with dignity and respect. Teachers encourage children to take responsibility for themselves and to care for others. Children work well with and alongside others. They also share ideas and develop friendships. As a result, children enjoy a calm and settled environment that supports their learning.</p><p>Children benefit from an interesting learning environment that is used to encourage their curiosity and sustained play. Teachers create interesting learning areas with input from children and families. There is a strong focus on developing children’s understanding and appreciation of the natural world. Connecting children’s learning with the local community is a strength of the centre.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to make choices about their own learning. Teachers provide a good range of varied resources and activities that promote children’s creativity, imagination and physical skills. Teachers observe children at play and skilfully intervene to guide and extend on their learning in purposeful ways. Teachers and children are making increasing use of information and communication technologies to support children’s learning outcomes.</p><p>During the review, ERO observed calm and unhurried interactions between teachers and infants and toddlers. These younger children benefit from having consistent teachers who are nurturing and caring. Teachers respond sensitively to each child’s individual needs and preferences. They empower children’s self esteem and independence while supporting their sense of security and wellbeing.</p><p>Children are given many opportunities to learn about New Zealand’s unique bicultural heritage. Centre leadership promotes thoughtful practices that are respectful of Māori culture. Leaders and teachers use suggestions of Māori whānau about how to integrate te ao Māori into daily routines and programmes.</p><p>Teachers are building a strong awareness and understanding of the need to be sensitive to the language, cultures and identity of individuals. Reviewers saw several examples of teachers effectively supporting children and their families. Staff are committed to further developing their knowledge and skills to benefit families and increase consistency across the centre.</p><p>The programme helps children to develop their confidence and communication skills in preparation for future learning. Teachers offer comprehensive support to families as they approach transition to school. Useful relationships have been established with a number of local schools. The centre is currently reviewing its practices for transitioning children within the centre.</p><p>The centre management committee is forward thinking and aware of the needs of the community. The committee members and centre leaders work well together. The committee actively promotes the centre’s philosophy and vision of the service. The centre managers have introduced opportunities for staff to take on leadership roles and responsibilities. This new process is currently in its developing stage. However, early indications are that teachers are taking ownership of their new roles and are excited by the leadership opportunities provided.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leaders have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps for planning and assessment are to strengthen the planning of teaching strategies to extend on children’s learning, and evaluate the impact of these strategies. They have also begun to look at ways to involve parents and children in planning learning pathways. This is an area to continue to develop.</p><p>The management committee agrees that the next three-year strategic plan should be strengthened by setting measurable goals and identifying what these goals will look like.</p><p>ERO has identified that self-review processes need further development to guide deeper investigations into evaluation of the quality of teaching and learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Amberley Community Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‘have’ or ‘have not’ taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Amberley Community Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>10 December 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
