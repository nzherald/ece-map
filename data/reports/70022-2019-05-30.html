</table><p>Avonhead Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Avonhead Playcentre operates as a cooperative under the governance and management of the Playcentre Federation, Upper South Island Region. The centre is licensed for 25 children, including a maximum of 10 children aged under two years. The playcentre operates four mornings a week, and is a 'pack away centre' that shares the space with others in a community hall.</p><p>Avonhead Playcentre is strongly supported by the regional hub and is focused on increasing the number of children who attend. A number of new families have recently joined the playcentre. The centre has recently redeveloped and extended the outdoor area so that it promotes a wider range of physical activities for children.</p><p>Since the 2014 ERO report, the philosophy has been updated and reviewed. It places a strong emphasis on the important role of parents in their children's learning and wellbeing, the significance of play, and children and adults learning together. The philosophy is linked to Te Whāriki (2017), the NZ Early Childhood Curriculum.</p><p>The parent cooperative has made some progress in addressing the key next steps identified in the previous report. Planning, assessment and evaluation still require further strengthening.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the Playcentre Federation, Upper South Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and engaged in the programme. They confidently select a good range of resources and equipment, and have many opportunities to develop their interests and lead the direction of their learning. The centre's culturally diverse, welcoming and inclusive environment helps children to play well together, and supports their wellbeing and sense of identity.</p><p>Children benefit from a curriculum that includes regular trips to the local community. They are supported to make their own choices from a good range of activities and play independently or together. Parents share their home cultures with children and encourage them to explore the natural environment.</p><p>Children with diverse learning needs, and those aged under two, are well supported. Mothers of infants and toddlers are provided with a designated space and resources to support their children.</p><p>The planning and programme processes and approaches successfully empower parents to participate in their child's learning. This actively encourages them to become knowledgeable and gain confidence in planning for their own and other children's learning. Clear teaching strategies are identified and used to guide adults to support children's learning. This would be further strengthened by evaluating the impact of individual and group planning on outcomes for children.</p><p>Internal evaluation practices are used to identify and improve what is important for children's learning at the playcentre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre's priorities for improvement, and ERO's evaluation confirms, are to:</p><ul>
<li>in consultation with parents, review the centre's philosophy, and make adjustments, as relevant</li>
<li>increase the use of bicultural practices in the programme and in centre documentation</li>
<li>continue to strengthen and embed planning, assessment and internal evaluation systems</li>
<li>continue to strengthen the parent cooperative through professional development that helps extend their understanding and skills.</li>
</ul><h3>Upper South Island Regional Governance</h3><p>There continues to be significant change occurring with the playcentre's governance and management at regional and federation levels.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Avonhead Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>30 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
