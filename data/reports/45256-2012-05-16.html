<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Crayons Community Kindergarten in Alexandra is privately owned and operated. The building, used previously by the kindergarten association, has been refurbished and the grounds redeveloped. The centre has been open since the beginning of 2010 and provides education and care for up to 40 children, from two to five years old.</p><p>The director has established a philosophy for the centre that provides:</p><ul>
<li>a safe, supportive environment</li>
<li>a structured programme</li>
<li>regular routines and activities</li>
<li>opportunities for the development of the whole child.</li>
</ul><p>Children settle easily into their time at the centre, quickly selecting the area of interest they want to explore. They are well cared for and have a good sense of belonging. They learn and practise good social skills, such as sharing and cooperating. Children play well together in groups, pairs or as individuals and can sustain their play.</p><p>All staff at the centre have suitable qualifications for their roles. The director ensures there is a good ratio of staff to children at all times. Teachers have very good relationships with the children and their families. Teachers take time to talk with parents before and after sessions at the centre. Teachers are good role models for the children in the ways they interact with all others in the centre&rsquo;s community.</p><p>The director and teachers agree that next steps for further development include:</p><ul>
<li>extending the ways they involve families in children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>developing shared understandings of the centre&rsquo;s philosophy in action.</li>
</ul><p>The director and teachers take all reasonable steps to provide a healthy and safe environment.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The director has established a centre to provide a structured programme that offers a planned range of activities and learning experiences for children.</p><h3>Positives</h3><p>Unique programme. The director has established an early learning centre with its own unique character. She developed a stated philosophy for children aged two to five years. A strong focus has been placed on providing a programme that places particular emphasis on:</p><ul>
<li>physical fitness, activity, development and confidence</li>
<li>preparing children to make a smooth transition to school.</li>
</ul><p>Parent feedback indicates children benefit from and enjoy this programme.</p><p>Relationships. Children show a good sense of belonging within their centre. They play and learn well together in a highly supportive environment. ERO observed:</p><ul>
<li>a welcoming atmosphere, where children and their parents are made to feel part of the centre&rsquo;s community</li>
<li>positive relationships between teachers and children</li>
<li>clear expectations for how children will relate to each other</li>
<li>teachers working and communicating well together throughout the day.</li>
</ul><p>Environment. Children play and learn in an environment that provides a wide range of activities that are enjoyable, challenging and that stimulate learning. Both indoor and outdoor areas are well equipped, spacious and provide a range of varied activities, including areas for construction, sandpit play, and gymnastic physical development on the veranda. Children enjoy making good use of the range of resources and equipment. The outdoor area provides some physical challenges and there are opportunities for imaginative and cooperative play.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>In discussions between the centre and ERO, it is agreed the following areas need further development and review. The director should work with the teaching team to:</p><ul>
<li>develop shared understandings of learning, philosophy in action, and how to record and plan for the individual learning needs of each child</li>
<li>include a bicultural dimension more often in the daily programme</li>
<li>find more ways to involve families in their child&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>extend self-review practices to ensure processes and procedures are clear, scheduled, and cover all aspects of the centre&rsquo;s operations over time.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Crayons Community Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendation</h2><p>ERO and the centre director agree that:</p><ul>
<li>the director and teachers work together to address the areas for development and review identified above.</li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>16 May 2012</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

Teachers are good role models for the children in the ways they interact with all others in the centre&rsquo;s community.</p><p>The director and teachers agree that next steps for further development include:</p><ul>
<li>extending the ways they involve families in children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>developing shared understandings of the centre&rsquo;s philosophy in action.</li>
</ul><p>The director and teachers take all reasonable steps to provide a healthy and safe environment.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
