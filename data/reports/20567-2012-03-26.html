<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Natural Learning Centre in New Lynn, Auckland, is a well established centre that caters for children two to five years of age. An adjacent centre provides care for infants and toddlers. The centre operates within the wider Kidicorp organisation which provides sound management and administrative support.</p><p align="left">Since the 2009 ERO report, the centre has re-developed the outdoor environment to provide spacious, well-designed play areas. The centre has plans to extensively renovate the indoor area in the near future.</p><p align="left">Children have a sense of belonging in the centre and are happy and settled. The centre manager and teachers are welcoming and their interactions with children and other adults are caring and thoughtful. Information shared by teachers and parents about children&rsquo;s learning and development promotes positive outcomes for children.</p><p align="left">The centre is ably led by an experienced centre manager. She and the teaching team are focused on providing a programme that is flexible and responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and strengths. Good quality resources encourage children to engage in physical, imaginative and explorative play.</p><p align="left">Children are well engaged in the programme. They make choices and have many opportunities for sustained, uninterrupted play. Teachers support children to be independent, capable learners.</p><p align="left">Assessment portfolios provide attractive records of children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers are beginning to identify children&rsquo;s interests and teaching strategies to support children&rsquo;s learning. Managers acknowledge that improving the evaluation of children&rsquo;s learning is a key priority to strengthen the centre&rsquo;s programme planning and assessment practices.</p><p align="left">Managers and ERO agree that more rigorous self review would promote on-going centre improvement and further develop teaching practice in the centre.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Natural Learning Centre - New Lynn was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atNatural Learning Centre - New Lynn.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Since the 2009 ERO review the outdoor environment has been re-developed to provide an attractive, well designed area for children in which to play and explore. The capable centre manager is well supported by Kidicorp personnel to lead teachers and provide a programme that supports and guides children&rsquo;s learning through play and planned activities.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Positive outcomes for children. Children are well cared for by teachers. Teachers use positive behaviour strategies and children are encouraged to be respectful and caring towards each other. They engage happily in the programme and choose from a wide range of learning activities.</p><p align="left">Flexible Routines. The daily structure of the programme provides extended periods of time for children to make choices and to participate in activities of their interest. Teachers are responsive to the preferences of individual children. Mealtimes are unhurried social occasions and are a natural continuation of the learning process.</p><p align="left">Relationships. Children develop positive, inclusive relationships with each other and with teachers. Positive relationships foster a sense of security for children and enable them to settle easily into the centre. Teachers work well together to extend children&rsquo;s learning and nurture their development. They appreciate the support and direction they receive from the centre manager.</p><p align="left">Parent partnerships. Children and parents are warmly welcomed by teachers into the centre. Parents&rsquo; aspirations for their children are nurtured by responsive teachers. They value the regular communication with teachers about their child&rsquo;s progress and development.</p><p align="left">Interactions. Teachers ask questions as they interact with children and their conversations promote children&rsquo;s thinking and oral language development. Teachers respond well to children&rsquo;s verbal cues and support children&rsquo;s learning and development in the context of play.</p><p align="left">Learning environment. The indoor and outdoor environments provide opportunities for children to engage in physical, imaginative and exploratory play. Children make choices and have easy access to the indoor and outdoor areas. A variety of meaningful learning activities supports their play and inquiry.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Literacy and numeracy. Teachers could further promote literacy and numeracy skills within meaningful contexts during play. The provision of visual clues, good access to writing tools and materials and improved modelling by teachers is likely to extend children&rsquo;s use of literacy and numeracy strategies.</p><p align="left">Programme planning and evaluation. Programme planning and evaluation is a centre-wide focus for development. Teachers are at the early stages of planning programmes that are linked to what they notice about children&rsquo;s interests, capabilities and dispositions. Centre managers agree with ERO that strengthening evaluation would help teachers to critique their teaching practice and improve the quality of programmes in an ongoing way.</p><p align="left">Self Review. The centre uses a good process for self review. The centre manager has identified the need to develop more reflective practice and to give more consideration to the impact of reviews and changes made on outcomes for children.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Natural Learning Centre - New Lynn completed an ERO CentreManagement Assurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendation</h2><p align="left">ERO and the centre managers agree that, with assistance from Kidicorp personnel, the centre manager and head teacher should continue to support teachers to use self review more effectively to improve the environment, programming and teaching practices.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table style="width: 568px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>

</table><p>26 March 2012</p><p>To the Parents and Community of Natural Learning Centre - New Lynn</p><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Natural Learning Centre - New Lynn.</p><p align="left">Natural Learning Centre in New Lynn, Auckland, is a well established centre that caters for children two to five years of age. An adjacent centre provides care for infants and toddlers. The centre operates within the wider Kidicorp organisation which provides sound management and administrative support.</p><p align="left">Since the 2009 ERO report, the centre has re-developed the outdoor environment to provide spacious, well-designed play areas. The centre has plans to extensively renovate the indoor area in the near future.</p><p align="left">Children have a sense of belonging in the centre and are happy and settled. The centre manager and teachers are welcoming and their interactions with children and other adults are caring and thoughtful. Information shared by teachers and parents about children&rsquo;s learning and development promotes positive outcomes for children.</p><p align="left">The centre is ably led by an experienced centre manager. She and the teaching team are focused on providing a programme that is flexible and responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and strengths. Good quality resources encourage children to engage in physical, imaginative and explorative play.</p><p align="left">Children are well engaged in the programme. They make choices and have many opportunities for sustained, uninterrupted play. Teachers support children to be independent, capable learners.</p><p align="left">Assessment portfolios provide attractive records of children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers are beginning to identify children&rsquo;s interests and teaching strategies to support children&rsquo;s learning. Managers acknowledge that improving the evaluation of children&rsquo;s learning is a key priority to strengthen the centre&rsquo;s programme planning and assessment practices.</p><p align="left">Managers and ERO agree that more rigorous self review would promote on-going centre improvement and further develop teaching practice in the centre.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
