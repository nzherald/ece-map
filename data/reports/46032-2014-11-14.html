</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Kids Count ECE Marne Rd is one of four centres operated by Kids Count Limited in South Auckland. The organisation provides umbrella policy and procedural guidelines for its centres. It uses additional Ministry of Education funding to implement a 'wrap around' service for low-income families who have difficulty accessing early childhood services.</p>
<p>The organisation provides transport for seventy percent of the children to attend centre sessions. It promotes parenting education and shares child development information and makes available support to whānau. The service’s family liaison officer helps develop successful partnerships between the centres and parents/whānau.</p>
<p>This centre offers full time and sessional education and care for eighty children up to five years, including up to ten children aged up to two years of age. Infants and toddlers have a separate area to play and explore. Most children attend for the twenty hours offered free.</p>
<p>Centre leaders work with families to help reduce transience and to help achieve more regular attendance by children. The curriculum they offer has a particular focus on preparing children for learning and supporting their transition to school.</p>
<p>The centre’s philosophy emphasises the importance of providing nurturing relationships and an environment that engages children in learning. Teachers are expected to support children to become confident and competent learners. Most of the children who attend are Māori and/or Pacific.</p>
<p>The centre was licensed in September 2013 and this is its first ERO review.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children are valued and affirmed by teachers for what they bring to their learning. They experience respectful interactions with staff who are focused on nurturing their development. Children are very well supported to develop social competencies. They have good opportunities to be physically active and to express their creativity. Children respond positively to this environment and show a willingness to engage in new learning.</p>
<p>Older children especially learn in an environment that promotes their confidence and builds on their capability. They are helped by teachers to use and extend their language, mathematics, and science learning in their play. The centre’s inclusive approaches ensure that all children, including those with special needs, are welcomed and appropriately catered for. Those children about to turn five are well supported to transition to school.</p>
<p>Teachers know children well and provide individualised care for infants. They respond sensitively to younger children’s changing requirements and preferences. Toddlers experience some good opportunities to explore and make discoveries.</p>
<p>Teachers document children’s learning and identify learning outcomes for children. Programmes relate well to children’s emerging interests and overall developmental needs. Teachers are culturally responsive and seek ways to build partnerships with parents and whānau. Children’s ideas are reflected in the programme. Teacher planning responds well to what children say and are interested in. This coordinated approach to teaching and learning has a positive influence on children’s interactions with each other and with adults.</p>
<p>The centre’s strong philosophy of catering to the aspirations of its parents underpins teaching practices and centre operations. Parents/whānau appreciate the way centre staff support their tamariki and their role as first teachers. They are well informed about the programme and their children’s progress. Contributions from parents/whānau are invited and valued.</p>
<p>Staff represent a variety of different ethnicities including Māori. Their backgrounds and experiences help them to understand the particular requirements of the centre’s whānau. Very good teaching practices reflect the bicultural expectations of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and<em>Ka Hikitia - Accelerating Success 2013-2017</em>, the Ministry of Education’s strategy for Māori success. Māori children are supported to succeed as Māori through these good practices and through staff engaging with the children’s whānau. Pacific children and their families are supported to share their cultural knowledge and perspectives.</p>
<p>The managing director provides the centre with a clear strategic direction focused on the principles of social justice and inclusion. Professional learning and development (PLD) programmes link well to the organisation’s purpose and teachers put new ideas into practice. The centre manager, supported by the owner, has high expectations of teaching practice and positive outcomes for children. Self review guides centre operations and contributes significantly to ongoing improvement in teaching practice.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>ERO supports the centre leaders’ focus on continuing to:</p>
<ul><li>explore ways to extend infant and toddler exploration and play</li>
<li>strengthen partnerships with parents and schools focused on learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids Count ECE Marne Rd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Kids Count ECE Marne Rd will be in four years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p>
<ul><li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>

<h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
