</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Scholars Preschoolis a small community-focused service near the township of Pukekohe. It provides education and care for up to 30 children from birth to five years of age, including up to 5 children under two years old. It is one of three centres that are operated by the owners who oversee all aspects of daily operations.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, the centre manager has appointed a team leader in each of the three age group areas in the centre. The team leader in each room manages the daily programme and supports teachers in their practice.</p><p>With external advice, the owners have documented centre priorities in a strategic plan and developed an annual action plan. Teachers have received professional support to improve their understanding of self review and the curriculum.</p><p>The centre’s comprehensive philosophy and vision promote children’s learning and are evident in teaching practices. The philosophy is closely linked to <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. Te Tiriti o Waitangi is respected as the founding document of Aotearoa New Zealand. There is a growing focus on developing a bicultural curriculum in the centre.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, centre staff have participated in a number of professional learning opportunities in response to concerns identified in the 2013 report. As a result there has been considerable improvement in leadership and the capability of teachers who have used professional learning to improve their understanding of self review and curriculum planning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and relate well to each other. Some children demonstrate tuakana/teina relationships and respectful social competence in their play. They negotiate their play and find innovative ways to use resources. Children confidently approach and enjoy sharing conversations with adults. They talk enthusiastically about their ideas.</p><p>Teachers are friendly and cheerful and have warm relationships with children. Some teachers use open-ended questions effectively with children. Children are encouraged to be independent and some demonstrate good self-help skills.</p><p>The centre is well resourced and children are free to choose indoor and outdoor play activities. Teachers are developing more nature based programmes that engage children’s interest. Displays are beginning to promote a bicultural curriculum, te reo Māori and children’s cultural identity. The owner intends to further develop the outdoor play area.</p><p>Parents/whānau are consulted and some respond favourably to the centre’s request for feedback. They are listened to and relate well to teachers. They share knowledge about their children easily with teachers and some are starting to contribute to the centre programme. Pacific and Māori parents feel included in the centre and participate by donating cultural items for the centre environment and the children’s programme.</p><p>Teachers have good relationships with families. They are working towards building stronger partnerships with families and with the community. The teaching team is stable and teachers work well together. Teachers are making good attempts to develop their curriculum planning and assessment practices. They are working towards strengthening their thinking around teaching and learning. Including a stronger focus on children’s emerging interests and dispositions as learners in this work would be useful.</p><p>Teachers use some te reo Māori with children. Displays show a growing understanding of the importance of tikanga. Children’s portfolios consist of individual and group stories about their participation in the programme and include next learning steps for children. Teachers could now consider how they support children’s identity, culture and language as part of the programme and the portfolio assessment records.</p><p>The manager/owner has undertaken leadership training to improve the quality of governance and management in the centre. As a result there have been significant changes, including the appointment of team leaders, a redevelopment of the appraisal system, and improvement to self review, including policy and management review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager agrees that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to develop effective assessment and planning processes in order to support a childled programme</li>
<li>strengthening partnership relationships with families and whānau to encourage more participation and contribution to decisions about their children’s learning</li>
<li>strengthening culturally responsive practices to support children’s language, culture and identity.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Scholars Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Scholars Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>26 November 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h4>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h4><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"> ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
