</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Parkway Kindergarten is located in Wainuiomata close to the local primary and intermediate schools and the college. The kindergarten provides flexible sessions for children aged over two. All teachers are qualified and two have full registration. One part-time teacher is involved in a programme of advice and guidance to gain full registration.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Hutt City Kindergarten Association (the association). Two professional practice managers (PPMs) are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers. Since the May 2012 ERO report there have been several changes of General Managers.</p><p>Areas of good performance acknowledged in the previous report continue to be strengths of the kindergarten. Teachers have responded to the highlighted areas for improvement that included aspects of self review and assessment, planning and evaluation. Teachers continue to develop and refine programmes for children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine reviews in the Hutt City Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The curriculum is soundly underpinned by the concepts of whanaungatanga and ako whakatere. Teachers nurture and build reciprocal, trusting relationships with children and their families. They work together to promote a child-centred programme with an emphasis on responsible risk taking and a programme that encourages children to be active learners. Children engage in an environment that promotes tuakana teina where older children accept leadership roles. Teaching practices are highly responsive to family needs and circumstances.</p><p>Assessment for learning shows children's immediate and emerging strengths, interests and skills. Narratives and photographs highlight their engagement and dispositional learning. Evidence of teachers’ analysis of observations is documented. A very recent part of this process is the collection and sharing of assessment information with families through e-Portfolios. This approach has the potential to further extend children’s learning. Teachers need to work collaboratively to evaluate this developing initiative and monitor the outcomes for children and families. Increased understanding of children’s learning pathways should further support how they plan to add complexity and strengthen outcomes for children.</p><p>Transition into the kindergarten is flexible to meet the individual needs of children, parents and whānau. A wall display provides useful information to promote inclusion. Teachers develop positive relationships that support smooth transition to the nearby school. They continue to enhance ways to build contacts with a number of other schools that children move on to.</p><p>Teachers' actions and responses effectively support participation, attendance and engagement of Māori and Pacific children and their families. A clear vision seeks to realise the potential of children and their whānau, and sets the direction for the kindergarten. Manaakitanga, whanaungatanga and tikanga Māori continue to be successfully embedded within teaching and learning. Teachers show a willingness to further develop treaty-based practices and increase their capability to be responsive to Māori children’s culture, language and identity.</p><p>The supportive, experienced head teacher provides effective leadership. Staff take time to reflect on their effectiveness. Self-review systems help to maintain an emotional and physical environment that supports children's learning and development. Teachers should strengthen self review and evaluation to guide improvement and sustain best practice by deepening the analysis of the information gathered.</p><p>The association is part way through the implementation of a new approach to appraisal. Once fully established this should assist leaders to provide a robust, supportive and developmental process. The PPMs should then undertake regular monitoring of how well appraisal is being implemented in each kindergarten.</p><p>The board receives a range of useful information. A key next step is for leaders to include more evaluative reporting to assist in decision making and ongoing resourcing. The strategic plan provides a vision and shared direction to guide development. Establishing clearer measures of success should strengthen evaluation of progress towards goals. In addition, strategies that promote cultural responsiveness to Māori and Pacific families should be highlighted in strategic documents.</p><p>The PPMs provide half-yearly written reports. These show how the kindergarten is meeting legislative requirements, and at times, make recommendations. The reports should be strengthened by providing critical feedback on the quality of teaching and the effectiveness of the curriculum in improving outcomes for children.</p><p>The association provides guidance and support to teachers for continuous improvement of teaching and learning. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>a useful framework and clear expectations, that guide kindergarten operations and support the services to meet legislative and health and safety requirements</li>
<li>opportunities for professional learning and development for staff</li>
<li>sound support for provisionally registered teachers.</li>
</ul><p>At the time of this review the association was involved in a formal review to determine the future direction of Hutt City kindergartens. ERO identified that within the current operating model the capacity of senior staff to provide targeted support that promotes ongoing improvement to teaching and learning is limited.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The PPM, head teacher, staff and ERO agree that key next steps for Parkway Kindergarten are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>the assessment and evaluation of children’s learning</li>
<li>self review and teacher inquiry by deepening the analysis of evidence gathered.</li>
<li>strategic and annual planning to better inform centre priorities for teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the measures used to evaluate the progress of the strategic plan</li>
<li>provide evaluative reports to support decision making</li>
<li>at a strategic level identify strategies to promote cultural responsiveness to Māori and Pacific families</li>
<li>monitor each kindergarten to ensure the robust implementation of the appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Parkway Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Parkway Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p><img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title="" align="left">Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>25 September 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
