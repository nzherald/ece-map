</table><p>The service needs support to further develop strategic planning, self review and personnel processes.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Playworx Kindy – Grandview, located in the residential area of Nawton, Hamilton, was opened in April 2013. It is one of three services under the same private ownership. The centre provides all-day and sessional care and education for children from birth to school age. Most of the children are of Māori descent. Centre property has been developed to provide purpose-designed, well-resourced indoor areas and a well-equipped playground. This is the centre’s first ERO report.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy is based on the belief that ‘play is our work and work is our play’. Leaders and teachers promote a sense of belonging for children and their families and whānau. The programme aims to encourage children to become confident learners who care for themselves and one another. There is a strong sense of community and support among children, staff and parents. The centre owner is committed to providing education and care at a minimum cost to families.</p><p>After a period of staff changes, the centre has employed some permanent teaching staff, one of whom is in the process of being formally designated as a team leader.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy playing and learning in interesting indoor and outdoor environments. They have a strong sense of belonging, and are settled and contributing members of the kindy community. They are interested in the natural world and have opportunities to be involved in gardening, looking after pets, and using their senses to explore the environment. Children actively participate in physical play and are able to develop their creativity in art, music, and dramatic play. They make choices, relate well to others, and develop friendships.</p><p>Parents and whānau are welcomed and included in the life of the centre. They develop good relationships with leaders and teachers, and appreciate what is happening for their children. Parents value teachers’ support for themselves and their children.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families very well. They develop partnerships with parents, which enable information about children’s home experiences and interests to be shared and followed up in the centre programme. Teachers are aware of children’s cultural identities and are increasingly including te reo and tikanga Māori. Celebrations such as Mātariki and inclusion of Pasifika culture extend the understanding and responsiveness of children and their families to diverse cultures.</p><p>Literacy, mathematics and science are integrated naturally into the programme. Teachers encourage children to follow their interests. They talk with children, sometimes with extended, interactive conversations, and questions to promote investigation and problem solving. Teachers are now aware of the need to continue their review of planning in order to strengthen intentional teaching to further improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers have developed as a cohesive team and work together to review learning environments and children’s individual profiles. They have begun to assess learning more accurately and consistently. This review should continue. Portfolios are available to children, who enjoy revisiting past activities. Many parents provide feedback to their child’s learning stories, celebrating their children’s learning.</p><p>The service is governed by two directors, one of whom manages the centre’s administration while the other is involved in teaching children and working with families. The centre has yet to implement processes for self review and staff appraisal, and there is a lack of clarity about staff roles and responsibilities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>There remains an urgent need to strengthen some centre practices in order to sustain and improve the quality of service management and leadership, and outcomes for children. Matters requiring further attention include:</p><p>establishing strategic goals that clearly identify priorities towards enacting and achieving the centre philosophy and purpose. These need to be supported by appropriate actions and resources to enable them to be achieved</p><p>continuing the review and development of planning, assessment and evaluation practices in order to enhance teachers’ capability to notice, recognise and respond effectively to children’s deep interests and identities, and evaluate the outcomes of the programme</p><p>ensuring actions for compliance outlined in this report are addressed.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Playworx Kindy - Grandview completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found areas of non-compliance in Playworx Kindy - Grandview. To meet agreed accountabilities the service provider must ensure that:</p><ol>
<li>An agreed process of regular and ongoing self review for all centre operations, focused on identifying strategic priorities for improving outcomes for children, is implemented.<br><em>[</em><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008: GMA6]</em></li>
<li>Roles and responsibilities of management and staff are clarified in order to improve relational trust, communication and collaborative ways of working. Staff members require an allocation of time to implement leadership expectations, critically reflect on their practice, and develop strategies for improvement. <br><em>[</em><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008: GMA7]</em></li>
<li>A process for effective, regular and ongoing staff appraisal is implemented. This needs to be linked to the Registered Teachers’ Criteria and focused on improving staff capabilities and outcomes for children. <br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008: GMA7]</em></li>
<li>Property in the areas used by staff and other adults is adequately secured.<br><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008: HS12</em></li>
<li>Individual hazards during excursions are accurately and fully identified and managed. <br><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008: HS12</em></li>
<li>Development Plan Recommendation</li>
</ol><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Playworx Kindy - Grandview will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>22 April 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
