</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Opunake Communities Kindergarten Incorporated is located in Opunake, South Taranaki. It is licensed for 50 children from one to five years of age, including 10 up to two years. The centre is licensed from 8.30am to 5.00pm and operates from 9.00am to 3.00pm from Monday to Friday.</p><p>The kindergarten is a non-profit, community-based early childhood education centre. A governance committee is elected annually, and meets regularly to support and contribute to the centre's strategic direction.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten’s philosophy and vision clearly underpin shared values and beliefs of the community. Clear links to <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and whanaungatanga underpin practice. The curriculum is focused on the development of foundation skills and learning dispositions for children.</p><p>Teachers have developed learning relationships with families to promote positive educational outcomes for children. Teaching is well paced and purposeful. Time, space and resources are used to successfully promote learning and motivate children’s curiosity. Centre leaders plan to review the philosophy to include outcomes from their review of bicultural practice.</p><p>Relationships are positive and supportive between children, adults and their peers. Social and emotional competency is well supported by modelled interactions during collaborative play.</p><p>Teachers acknowledge and value the cultural identity of Māori learners, linked to place and identity. Te ao Māori is becoming a meaningful part of children’s daily experience. Waiata, mihimihi and the use of te reo Māori reflect the centre’s curriculum priorities. Continuing to develop, and provide feedback to teachers about, culturally responsive practices should further support the centre’s curriculum aspirations.</p><p>Teachers know children well. Children are encouraged to talk, listen and question during interactions with teachers and peers. Flexible routines, including at meal times, suit children’s needs and promote self management.</p><p>Children participate in well-planned experiences. Individuals engage in a wide range of curriculum activities to promote their participation in, and enjoyment of, learning. Sustainable practice and learning about the environment are valued parts of the curriculum.</p><p>The key teacher role supports children up to two years of age to develop secure attachments. Regular and ongoing communication between staff and with parents ensures individual needs are supported.</p><p>Transition into the centre is flexible to meet the individual needs of children, parents and whānau. The kindergarten induction pack provides useful information about expectations and to support inclusion. Teachers are currently reviewing approaches for children's transition to school.</p><p>Self review is developing purposefully for teachers to consider current practice and support ongoing development. Teachers are suitably supported to reflect each day on children’s learning and consider how best to respond to children’s emerging interests.</p><p>Leaders have clear roles and responsibilities specified in their job descriptions. Self-review practice is developing and achieving useful outcomes. Systems and processes are used to manage safety and security in the environment.</p><p>Trustees require support from centre leaders to improve their governance of the kindergarten. The head teacher should work collaboratively with trustees to clarify the responsibilities that leadership has in supporting governance.</p><p>Trustees are seeking to develop sustainable practice, and they continue work to complete a manual to support them to undertake their committee roles. External support has been accessed to provide guidance about how best to plan next steps and ensure more effective governance practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Improved outcomes are needed in relation to the administration and management responsibilities specified in the centre leaders' job descriptions. Increased support to meet these dimensions of practice should help to strengthen the governance committee's practice and increase its ability to review and plan strategically.</p><p>To improve practice, governance committee members should:</p><ul>
<li>seek external appraisal of centre leaders aligned to expectations in their job descriptions</li>
<li>continue to update and revise policies</li>
<li>review current strategic planning and revise the annual plan to guide future development.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Opunake Communities Kindergarten Incorporated completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice the governance committee should ensure appraisal and performance management is undertaken for centre leaders.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Opunake Communities Kindergarten Incorporated will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>14 October 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
