</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rainbow Lemon Street Early Learning Centre operates in central New Plymouth as part of Kidicorp. The centre previously operated under 2 separate licences on the same premises. It was relicensed under the 2008 regulations in 2013 under 1 lisence. This licence allows for part or full day sessions for up to 70 children including 25 children aged up to 2 years.</p><p>Day-to-day management is overseen by the centre manager, supported by team leaders in each of three areas. Administration support is provided by the office manager. All children have freshly cooked food, daily.</p><p>Three separate areas operate, each with independent indoor and outdoor spaces. These cater for children aged up to 2 years, those aged 2 to 3½ years and those over 3½ years. Both the indoor and outdoor environments have undergone substantial development since the 2011 ERO review. The outdoor environment has been designed with sustainability and natural resources in mind.</p><p>The centre’s recently revised philosophy aligns with the whakatauki – “He tanagta, he tangata, he tangata” and focuses on respect, joy, resilience and courage.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happily engaged in sustained, cooperative play. Interactions with teachers are positive. Play is both teacher-facilitated and child-initiated. Children display respect for themselves, others and their surroundings. The extensive, attractive outdoor area caters for children’s physical needs and invites exploration.</p><p>Children are well supported by teachers to become confident and competent learners. Teachers know them well and contribute positively to their education and care. Routines respond to children’s needs and encourage growing independence. Resources are easily accessible, attractively stored and offer opportunities to engage in imaginative, active and creative play.</p><p>Natural resources provide a foundation for a curriculum that is underpinned by the centre’s philosophy. Teachers seek opportunities to enrich the programme. They make good use of community members and include their expertise into the programme. Excursions provide another opportunity to enrich the curriculum. There is good modelling of literacy and numeracy through play.</p><p>The centre has a culture of inclusion. Children with special needs are well catered for and their learning requirements discussed. Individual programmes are developed in consultation with parents and external agencies to meet the needs of these children and their families.</p><p>The cultural backgrounds of children are known and their identities fostered. Families are welcomed and encouraged to share their culture with others.</p><p>Bicultural practices are developing. Teachers seek ways to integrate tikanga Māori into the curriculum in authentic ways. Further development of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori is a priority. Maintaining relationships with whānau and gaining knowledge of the aspirations they hold for their tamariki is an ongoing development.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are very respectful of families and value positive relationships based around teaching and learning. Parents have multiple opportunities to discuss their children’s learning with teachers and are provided with regular information about children’s progress. Assessment profiles are attractive and informative. They include observations of children, their learning and records of enrichment events. Parents have an attractive record of the range of their child’s experiences. Children and parents have ready access to these books.</p><p>Information from individual and group assessment is not yet efficiently used to plan the curriculum. Teachers should use what they notice and recognise in children's learning to plan responses to individuals and groups.</p><p>A positive team culture is highly evident. Collaborative ways of working are fostered between all involved in the service. Governors, leaders and teachers clearly understand the purpose and process of self review for improvement.</p><p>The service is well governed by Kidicorp who provide external professional support and opportunities for focused professional learning. Support and guidance is improvement focused and impacts positively on teacher practices. There is alignment between appraisal, professional practice and strategic intent. Carefully considered improvements have a positive impact on children, parents, and teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>grow teacher confidence and competence in promoting te reo me ngā tikanga Māori</li>
<li>improve evaluation and planning practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rainbow Lemon Street completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rainbow Lemon Street will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><p>2 April 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
