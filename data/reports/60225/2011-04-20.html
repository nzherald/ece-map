<a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><p>This supplementary review report was prepared in accordance with standard procedures approved by the Chief Review Officer.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Lower Hutt City Childcare Centre governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the February 2010 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>provision of education and care;</li>
<li>personnel management;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare; and</li>
<li>any other matters that may arise during the course of the review that impact on the quality of education and care.</li>
</ul><a id="2-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>The Education Review Office has annually reviewed this centre since 2006 and the 2010 report noted that improvement has been slow and insufficient progress had been made.</p><p>In February 2010, ERO reported concerns with the quality of education, including assessment, planning and evaluation; personnel management; and in particular health, safety and welfare.</p><p>Since the last review the Ministry of Education (the Ministry) lowered the status of the centre’s licence to provisional. That is, the centre, by 31 January, had to address eleven areas of concern in order to retain a licence to operate.</p><p>There have been changes to the senior staff and an acting supervisor has been appointed. The centre has also drawn on external support to meet the requirements of the provisional licence. These provisions were met on time and the centre now has a full licence to operate.</p><p>In meeting these provisions, the centre has also met many of the areas identified in the 2010 ERO report as requiring attention.</p><p>The centre’s board of trustees has approved a comprehensive strategic plan that will facilitate ongoing development and maintenance of standards.</p><p>Robust and supportive personnel policies are now in place to help staff in their professional development. Appraisal documents have been reviewed and now include the teacher registration criteria along with personal and professional goals.</p><p>The environment is positive and purposeful. The children interact well and play cooperatively. Teachers help maintain a calm atmosphere and respond well to the children’s needs.</p><p>The centre is well resourced, although there is still a need for a wider range of appropriate books for all ages.</p><p>The centre developed an action plan to address all the health and safety issues identified by the ERO 2010 report. All areas of concern have now been rectified.</p><p>However, the outdoor area has a thin layer of unsuitable bark chips and is not sufficient to prevent injury if a child falls. The centre is aware of this problem and has plans in place to install an appropriate safety surface.</p><p>Overall, the children in this centre are well supported in their learning and social development.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="3-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Findings</h2><h3>Provision of education and care</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>In February 2010 ERO reported that “insufficient progress has been made in improving the quality of education [and] teacher interactions and the learning environment have not sufficiently improved over the past three years.”</p><p>In particular the report recommended that:</p><ul>
<li>the supervisor and teachers improve the quality of the environment and programme for children aged under two years of age;</li>
<li>the teachers continue to improve their interactions with children to support children’s engagement in mealtime routines and to extend programme experiences; and</li>
<li>teachers continue to develop assessment, planning and evaluation practices to improve learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Considerable progress has been made in these areas and the Ministry is supporting the centre staff by providing professional development to further improve assessment and self-review practices.</p><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>Since the previous review staff changes have occurred and the centre has contracted external support to address the issues identified in that report. The changes have resulted in considerable progress.</p><p>The programme is varied and inclusive. There is a wide range of opportunities and resources to support the children’s development.</p><p>The children play cooperatively or happily on their own. There is a settled atmosphere and the children are happy and active.</p><p>The physical environment has been refurbished and the area for the infants and toddlers is now tidy, comfortable, and has a range of items for the children to play with.</p><p>Teachers establish warm and caring relationships with children, contributing to a settled environment. The children are given appropriate attention, and in many cases encouraged to try something new. Teachers usually are skilled at discussing the child’s interest and extending their language.</p><p>The children are familiar with the orderly meal time routines, which have been modified. They have responsibilities such as handing out plates to the table, distributing water, and cleaning up. Each child is able to serve their own meal under a teacher’s supervision, and there are often positive discussions about the food they are eating. The morning and afternoon teas are flexible and the children are monitored to ensure they have a good daily diet.</p><p>The provided lunch is nutritious and the menu for the day is written on a whiteboard for parents to view.</p><p>Most teachers are assessing the children appropriately and record the child’s development in a portfolio book. Each child has a profile book which is accessible and accessed and discussed. These profiles have a suitable format and the stories are varied and informative and sometimes linked to a Te Whāriki objective.</p><h4>Areas for further improvement</h4><p>There are still areas for development and the centre management is working with the staff to improve the centre’s education and care provision.</p><p>Not all staff are challenging the children in their language development. There are examples where good open questions are being used, but some staff seem to have more of a role of supervisor rather than teacher. The improved appraisal system should enable the managers to identify staff whose practice needs further development in this area.</p><p>The self-review process is still limited and the self-review folder needs to be reviewed and better organised. Currently not all of the material is relevant. Responses from the parents to the parent teacher meeting are very positive, but there is no collation of the information and no follow up to their suggestions documented.</p><p>While the profile books have a suitable format, some teachers are not using these to full advantage. There could be more effort made to obtain parent voice. This need not be written by the parent, but, in conversation with the parent their response to the story could be recorded. It would also be useful for the parents to be given some suggestions on what to do at home to further develop the child’s story.</p><p>A further area for development is to review the range of books available for the children. They show a real interest in the books and a wider range to cater for the under two year old children and the four year old children would benefit these groups.</p><p>The centre does not have a documented procedure to transition children to school. The centre should establish links with the local schools and give parents opportunities to help their child move smoothly into the school system.</p><h3>Personnel management</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2010 ERO report required the centre to take actions to meet their legal requirements related to personnel management. The report directed the centre to “implement personnel policies which promote quality practices including, staff appraisal and professional development for both managers and educators.”</p><p>It also required the development and implementation of a robust performance appraisal for the supervisor.</p><p>There did not appear to be a clear complaints process for parents to follow when issues arose. The report recommended that an outline of the process be placed on the notice board at the entrance to the centre.</p><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>The personnel policies and procedures are still being developed. In particular, an overall policy outlining the board of trustees’ expectations and obligations should be reviewed.</p><p>The personnel policies that promote quality practices for both managers and teachers are being implemented and a more supportive and rigorous appraisal system is now in place. The teacher registration criteria have been incorporated into the assessment part of the appraisal system.</p><p>Teachers are supported to further their training and encouraged to work towards qualification status.</p><p>A suitable complaints policy has been developed. This is referred to in a notice at the entrance to the centre and parents have a clear idea of the process. The policy and operation manuals are also available for parents to view at the entrance.</p><h4>Areas for further improvement</h4><p>The centre needs to document the annual professional development programme for the year and develop expectations of staff to continue their education through appreciating what constitutes good practice in the early childhood sector.</p><p>A wider range of professional reading for both staff and parents would help to raise the expectations of these groups.</p><h3>Health, safety and welfare</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The previous ERO report identified a large number of issues that could compromise the health and safety of children and staff at the centre. Many of these were documented as conditions to be met before the full licence would be reinstated.</p><h4>Areas of progress</h4><p>Considerable progress has been made to make the environment more healthy and safe for the children and staff. A board member has responsibility for the health and safety of the centre. This responsibility is documented in a detailed job description. Some of the tasks are delegated to the supervisor and teachers and a suitable system for reporting hazards has been established.</p><p>The following were identified as concerns in the last ERO review and have now been addressed.</p><p>Systems are in place to:</p><ul>
<li>ensure unlocking the fire exits in play and sleep spaces and ensuring that children’s beds are not placed in front of these exits during sleep times;</li>
<li>the centre stereos, storage cabinets and heavy items stored on high shelves likely to fall and injure children and adults in the event of an earthquake are secured;</li>
<li>ensure that all beds used by children are so spaced or arranged to ensure hygiene, safety and adequate means of access;</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-lower-hutt-city-childcare-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">To the Parents and Community of Lower Hutt City Childcare Centre</h2><p>This supplementary review evaluates the quality of education and care received by the children and the performance of the centre’s management in relation to specific terms of reference.</p><p>The Education Review Office [ERO] evaluation of Lower Hutt City Childcare Centre follows.</p><p>The Education Review Office has annually reviewed this centre since 2006 and the 2010 report noted that improvement has been slow and insufficient progress had been made.</p><p>In February 2010, ERO reported concerns with the quality of education, including assessment, planning and evaluation; personnel management; and in particular health, safety and welfare.</p><p>Since the last review the Ministry of Education (the Ministry) lowered the status of the centre’s licence to provisional. That is, the centre, by 31 January, had to address eleven areas of concern in order to retain a licence to operate.</p><p>There have been changes to the senior staff and an acting supervisor has been appointed. The centre has also drawn on external support to meet the requirements of the provisional licence. These provisions were met on time and the centre now has a full licence to operate.</p><p>In meeting these provisions, the centre has also met many of the areas identified in the 2010 ERO report as requiring attention.</p><p>The centre’s board of trustees has approved a comprehensive strategic plan that will facilitate ongoing development and maintenance of standards.</p><p>Robust and supportive personnel policies are now in place to help staff in their professional development. Appraisal documents have been reviewed and now include the teacher registration criteria along with personal and professional goals.</p><p>The environment is positive and purposeful. The children interact well and play cooperatively. Teachers help maintain a calm atmosphere and respond well to the children’s needs.</p><p>The centre is well resourced, although there is still a need for a wider range of appropriate books for all ages.</p><p>The centre developed an action plan to address all the health and safety issues identified by the ERO 2010 report. All areas of concern have now been rectified.</p><p>However, the outdoor area has a thin layer of unsuitable bark chips and is not sufficient to prevent injury if a child falls. The centre is aware of this problem and has plans in place to install an appropriate safety surface.</p><p>Overall, the children in this centre are well supported in their learning and social development.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow-up action they plan to do. You should talk to the management or licensee if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>National Manager Review Services (Acting)</p><p>Central Region</p>
