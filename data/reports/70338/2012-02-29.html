The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">ABC Waltham caters for children from two years old to school age. The centre has been recently renovated to provide open and inviting play and service areas in the indoor space. Mature trees and garden plots help to provide a natural outdoor area. Most managers and staff are qualified and experienced early childhood teachers or completing early childhood teacher qualifications.</p><p align="left">Children are confident and happy learners. They are well supported by teachers who are focused on their learning and well-being. Learning is fun, challenging and meaningful. Children are respectful and inclusive of others.</p><p align="left">Te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori are well integrated throughout the programme. Children are proud of New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage. They enjoy conversing in te reo M&#257;ori and caring for and understanding the environment. Staff value relationships with wh&#257;nau and actively seek to involve them in the programme and their children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p align="left">The indoor and outdoor areas are well presented and resourced. Science, health and fitness are features of the planned programme. Literacy and numeracy activities are becoming more integrated, meaningful and relevant as a result of recent self review and professional development. Appropriate procedures and practices are in place to provide a safe and healthy environment for children, families and staff.</p><p align="left">Managers have identified and ERO agrees that the next steps for managers and teachers should include:</p><ul>
<li>making better use of self review, assessment and planning to identify the learning occurring for children and to show how teachers can promote this learning</li>
<li>implementing comprehensive teaching programmes to support children with oral language delay.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore, ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of ABC Waltham was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atABC Waltham.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The centre philosophy states that teachers will support children in their learning through sustained and meaningful interactions. Parents and wh&#257;nau will be encouraged to share information and be involved in their child&rsquo;s learning. The programme will be planned to help individual children develop their interests and abilities in meaningful and interesting ways. Te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori will be well integrated into the programme. Children will become confident in the culture of New&nbsp;Zealand/Aotearoa.</p><h4>Strengths</h4><p align="left">Teachers use a good range of teaching approaches that build on and challenge children&rsquo;s thinking and understandings. ERO observed children who were confident learners, took pride in their achievements and persisted to experience success.</p><p align="left">Children have many opportunities to regularly hear and use te reo M&#257;ori. M&#257;ori values and beliefs are successfully interwoven into all aspects of centre life.</p><p align="left">Children have warm and nurturing relationships with their teachers and each other. Teachers take a keen interest in the children and their lives. Children in turn willingly share aspects of their home lives with teachers and other children. This enriches the curriculum and builds stronger links between home and centre learning.</p><p align="left">The centre is welcoming and inclusive of children with special needs, and children and families from many cultural backgrounds.</p><p align="left">Teachers provide an interesting programme where resources are presented in ways that invite children to participate, explore and test their ideas in meaningful ways. Science, health and fitness activities are features of the planned programme. In addition, ERO observed children involved in complex dramatic play that showed imagination, negotiation, humour and leadership.</p><p align="left">Managers and teachers have made good use of self review and professional development to make literacy and numeracy more meaningful and relevant for children.</p><p align="left">The managers provide effective leadership for the smooth operation of the centre and improving learning and teaching. Teachers work well together to support children&rsquo;s development and well-being.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Managers have identified and ERO agrees that the centre&rsquo;s next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>make better use of self review, assessment and planning to identify the learning occurring for children and show how teaching promotes this learning</li>
<li>develop and implement a comprehensive programme of teaching strategies to support children with oral language delay.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long-term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of Children with Moderate to Severe Special Needs</h3><p align="left">As part of this review, ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><h4>Area of strength</h4><p align="left">The managers and staff are sensitive and supportive to children with special needs and their families. They establish positive relationships with the children and the families. They use a range of effective strategies to help other children to be welcoming and inclusive of children with special needs.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of ABC Waltham completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><p>29 February 2012</p><p>To the Parents and Community of ABC Waltham</p><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on ABC Waltham.</p><p align="left">ABC Waltham caters for children from two years old to school age. The centre has been recently renovated to provide open and inviting play and service areas in the indoor space. Mature trees and garden plots help to provide a natural outdoor area. Most managers and staff are qualified and experienced early childhood teachers or completing early childhood teacher qualifications.</p><p align="left">Children are confident and happy learners. They are well supported by teachers who are focused on their learning and well-being. Learning is fun, challenging and meaningful. Children are respectful and inclusive of others.</p><p align="left">Te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori are well integrated throughout the programme. Children are proud of New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage. They enjoy conversing in te reo M&#257;ori and caring for and understanding the environment. Staff value relationships with wh&#257;nau and actively seek to involve them in the programme and their children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p align="left">The indoor and outdoor areas are well presented and resourced. Science, health and fitness are features of the planned programme. Literacy and numeracy activities are becoming more integrated, meaningful and relevant as a result of recent self review and professional development. Appropriate procedures and practices are in place to provide a safe and healthy environment for children, families and staff.</p><p align="left">Managers have identified and ERO agrees that the next steps for managers and teachers should include:</p><ul>
<li>making better use of self review, assessment and planning to identify the learning occurring for children and to show how teachers can promote this learning</li>
<li>implementing comprehensive teaching programmes to support children with oral language delay.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore, ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
