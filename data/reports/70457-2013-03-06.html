<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Cotswold Preschool and Nursery is well placed to promote children&rsquo;s wellbeing and learning.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Children at this centre learn in a family-like environment and are happy and highly involved. The programme is focused on meeting children&rsquo;s interests and needs. Small numbers in the nursery enable infants and toddlers to have valuable one-to-one attention from staff.</p><p>Teachers know the children and their families well and effectively work as a team. They support children&rsquo;s learning, wellbeing and independence in positive and respectful ways.</p><p>Teachers are well supported by the licensee and senior teacher to provide an interesting and stimulating learning environment for children. Renovations have extended the nursery&rsquo;s indoor and outdoor areas and made extra space for storing resources in the preschool.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Children have positive relationships with staff. They play well together and are confident to make their own decisions about what, where and how to play. Teachers show children that their ideas are valued and welcome. They respond well to children&rsquo;s interests and needs and are very aware of those who may need help to join in play activities.</p><p>Children under two years old are well cared for and settled. They are able to play with the older children from time to time. The teacher includes some learning activities that are the same as those in the preschool. This helps the younger children to transition more easily from the nursery to the preschool.</p><p>Teachers share information about children during the programme so that as a team, they can better meet children&rsquo;s needs. They help children to solve problems and manage their behaviour, when necessary.</p><p>Other positive features of the centre and programme include:</p><ul>
<li>the well designed, stimulating and challenging outdoor areas</li>
<li>the good use made of natural resources and plants to raise children&rsquo;s awareness of the natural environment</li>
<li>the appropriate inclusion of te reo M&#257;ori during learning activities and routines.</li>
</ul><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>The licensee and senior teacher have identified and ERO agrees that the service&rsquo;s priorities for continued improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>building on current planning, assessment and self-review practices that are focused on improving outcomes for children</li>
<li>strengthening appraisal by including formal observation and feedback against the Registered Teacher Criteria</li>
<li>developing long-term and strategic plans of how, and by when, the centre&rsquo;s priorities will be met.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Cotswold Preschool and Nursery completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>6 March 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
