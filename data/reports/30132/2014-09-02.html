</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Kuiti Community Childcare Centre (The Cottage) is an incorporated society operated by an executive committee of elected parents. The committee provides overall strategic and comprehensive governance systems that ensure the centre is well managed. The centre provides an all-day and sessional service for 83 children in two main play areas. The centre is located in a converted house and a well-designed, purpose-built preschool for early learners 0-3 years. The early learners’ area provides education and care for babies and toddlers, and the pre-school for young children. The Cottage enrols children from the town and surrounding rural areas. Most children are New Zealand European and 12 are of Māori descent.</p><p>The licensee/manager is experienced and continues to oversee all aspects of the daily operation of the centre. Staff retention is good, and recent changes have seen two existing staff undertake leadership roles.</p><p>The Cottage environment is very well resourced and areas of play are frequently reviewed to ensure children’s interests are sustained. The high quality equipment in both indoor and outdoor areas provides children with many opportunities to explore their interests.</p><p>The centre philosophy promotes a family like learning environment that enhances the well being and development of babies, toddlers and young children. The centre fosters children’s confidence, understanding and promotes positive relationships with others.</p><p>Te Kuiti Community Childcare Centre has a positive ERO reporting history.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Babies and toddlers settle quickly in a warm, welcoming and nurturing environment. They choose their activities and participate independently in familiar routines. They explore and make sense of the world around them as they experiment with messy play, water and a variety of toys and resources. Babies and toddlers have easy access to a well-designed outside play area that extends their physical skills. They develop friendly relationships as they communicate with one another, siblings, and teachers. Teachers, parents and whānau work closely together to support babies and toddlers in care routines and as they transition into and within the centre.</p><p>Young children in the pre-school are actively involved in learning and exploring indoor and outdoor areas that stimulate and sustain their interests. They enjoy active adventure play, join together in groups for role play, and spend time drawing, writing and reading books. Children develop mathematical problem-solving strategies by sharing and dividing resources, turn taking and estimating. They learn through water and sand play that encourages understandings about quantity and weight. Children have many opportunities to show leadership in the centre and enjoy physical challenge, socialising with others, problem solving and self-managing their play.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate cultural sensitivity and include all parents and whānau as contributing members of the centre community. They are responsive to the diverse needs of all children and plan purposeful activities to support and extend children’s learning. Māori children and whānau appreciate their language and culture being valued and shared through daily karakia, waiata and respect for tikanga Māori. Children who have special abilities and require extra assistance are well integrated into centre activities.</p><p>Parents are often present in the centre and have many opportunities to participate in play with their children. They share the aspirations they have for their children with staff. Teachers gain a deep understanding of children’s home interests and experiences. Parents are invited to attend evenings about their child’s development. These practices contribute to strong relationships between the centre and parents.</p><p>A feature of the centre is an ongoing commitment to an environmental programme. Teachers are innovative and provide children with many opportunities to be involved with increasingly complex ideas about the world around them.</p><p>Teachers use portfolios to monitor children’s progress and extend their interests. There are examples of children’s art work, drawings and their use of a range of different resources. Teachers provide informative summaries of children’s learning and progress at the end of each term for parents.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The licensee/manager ERO agrees that the areas identified for further development are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>reflect the child’s voice in their learning</li>
<li>involve parents in their child’s learning</li>
<li>evaluate children’s progress overtime.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Kuiti Community Childcare Centre Inc completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Kuiti Community Childcare Centre Inc will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>2 September 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
