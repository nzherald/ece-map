</table><p>Childsplay Unlimited - Lynfield requires support to improve health and safety and governance systems to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Childsplay Unlimited - Lynfield requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Childsplay Unlimited - Lynfield is one of two Childsplay Unlimited centres in Auckland. This centre is licensed for 59 children, including 14 under the age of two years. The purpose-built centre is arranged into three age-related rooms for infants, toddlers and preschool children.</p><p>The centre serves a culturally diverse community. There are small numbers of Māori and Pacific children on the roll. Most children and their families are Indian or Chinese, and many speak languages other than English. Some teachers at the centre communicate with children and families in their home languages.</p><p>The director provides governance and leadership support, and a centre manager is responsible for the daily running of the centre and supports curriculum design and delivery. Registered and unregistered teaching staff provide care for children and plan and deliver learning programmes.</p><p>The centre's philosophy places importance on celebrating cultural diversity and being inclusive. It focuses on developing caring, reciprocal and respectful relationships between children and adults, and promotes programmes based on children's strengths, needs and interests.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified positive aspects of practice including responsive teachers, well-planned learning programmes and effective management. It identified areas for development that included provision for Māori and Pacific children, communication with families, professional learning, self review and strategic planning. Many of the positive areas identified in the 2015 report have not been sustained.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers welcome children and their families and provide a warm and caring environment within which children play and learn. They encourage a calm, slow pace to the day that supports children to engage in play. Children are kind to each other and have a strong sense of belonging in the centre.</p><p>Teachers value children's play and provide good access to appropriate resources and equipment. They know children well and follow their learning cues. Children's languages and cultural identities are acknowledged and recognised in the learning programme. Teachers have made progress since the 2015 ERO review in including te reo and tikanga Māori through waiata and karakia and promoting an inclusive curriculum that is focused on children's care and education. They incorporate literacy, mathematics and science learning in daily programmes.</p><p>Infants and toddlers receive appropriate support and challenge. Their oral language development is promoted through singing and conversations. Teachers could enhance support for these children by providing more individualised caregiving.</p><p>The director is actively involved in the running of the centre and has a vision to provide a quality service. She is supportive of leaders and teachers and is providing increased opportunities for whānau involvement in the centre. The centre's strategic plan identifies goals for future development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre managers and teachers include seeking external guidance to help:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop and implement a learning programme that caters to the individual learning needs of infants and toddlers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the centre's internal evaluation process so that it leads to improving outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen and update assessment, planning and evaluation policy and procedures, so that these are more reflective of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and guide practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Childsplay Unlimited - Lynfield completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to the teacher appraisal system, police vetting and other aspects of health and safety. To meet requirements, the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>arranging stretchers in the cot room so there is clear access for adults to walk between for supervision when monitoring children sleeping</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>police vetting of all non-registered staff and recording of all personnel safety checks and their results</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teaching staff appraisals by the professional leader, based on/to meet current Teaching Council requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS10, GMA7, 7A; Education Act 1989, s382(1).</em></p><p>Since the onsite visit the service has provided ERO with evidence that shows it has police vetted all non-registered staff.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>24 January 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.<span dir="ltr"> </span></p>
