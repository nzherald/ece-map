</table><p>Pukeko Preschool Papatoetoe is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pukeko Preschool in Papatoetoe is one of four centres in the Pukeko organisation, three of which operate in South Auckland and the fourth in Hamilton. The centre is licensed for 40 children, including up to eight under two years of age.</p><p>The centre has changed ownership twice since ERO's previous report and has been operating under new ownership and the Pukeko umbrella for just over a year. The centre manager leads a team of eight teachers, five of whom are qualified. Half of the children enrolled are Indian. There are small groups of Māori and Pacific children, and others from diverse backgrounds.</p><p>The philosophy identifies the kind of adults the teachers want the tamariki to become and what the centre intends to do to achieve this goal. The philosophy includes a commitment to bringing te reo Māori and tikanga Māori into daily routines.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and relaxed in the centre. They are warmly welcomed on arrival and quickly settle at an activity of interest. Children benefit from caring relationships with teachers and the family-like environment. They are able to independently access resources and often work in small groups. Children engage in social play and create their own challenges in the outdoor area. They are busy and involved in their play.</p><p>The multicultural staff are genuinely responsive to the diverse community. Teachers are often able to speak the first language of immigrant families and have knowledge of cultural traditions and values. Teachers support children well to become familiar with te ao Māori through waiata, karakia and cultural activities. Teachers confidently use te reo with visitors.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from learning in a small group with a high ratio of adults. Teachers provide meaningful support for their exploration and language development. Babies show trust in adults who are responsive to their individual needs and interests. Although these younger children are accommodated in a separate area, they regularly mix with older children at the start and end of each day.</p><p>The centre manager is building a cohesive and collaborative approach to teaching, and supporting children's strengths and interests. It is timely for teachers to review their role in enacting the centre's philosophy to improve outcomes for all children. It would also be useful for teachers in the older children's area to consider ways of engaging children in more meaningful conversations. This would place value on children's ideas and thinking, and encourage their oral language and vocabulary development, an essential part of preparation for later learning.</p><p>The centre manager has identified the important task of building teaching relationships. She has also identified the need to have effective assessment, planning and evaluation processes. She is aware of the importance of supporting teachers to better understand <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The centre manager operates the centre efficiently through the sound policy framework and appropriate health and safety systems of the Pukeko organisation. She works collaboratively with the owners to develop and monitor the centre's strategic direction, which provides a guide for ongoing centre development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers agree that the key next steps are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>reviewing and updating the philosophy statement to better reflect their intentions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening planning, assessment and evaluation in order to more effectively guide teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to provide leadership training to support the manager in her role.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pukeko Preschool Papatoetoe completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>27 September 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
