</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Edmonton Community Kindergarten is a community-based kindergarten in Te Atatu South that is located behind the Te Atatu Community Centre. The centre is licensed for up to 30 children between two and five years of age. Children and their families have diverse cultural backgrounds. The kindergarten is a not-for-profit, incorporated society. It has been open for 40 years and has strong connections to the local community.</p>
<p>The kindergarten’s philosophy places strong emphasis on providing high quality and affordable early childhood education experiences in partnership with parents, whānau and the community. Its curriculum also promotes NZ’s bicultural partnership and reflects a commitment to the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. Teachers emphasise respectful relationships and view children as capable, competent learners.</p>
<p>The kindergarten is governed by a management committee that works collaboratively with staff to monitor the strategic priorities of the centre. The committee delegates day-to-day management of the centre to the head teacher. The head teacher and two other teachers are qualified and registered. Teachers reflect some of the different cultures that make up the kindergarten’s community.</p>
<p>Positive aspects identified in ERO’s previous reports on the centre have been sustained over time. Respectful relationships, a responsive learning programme, a well resourced learning environment and effective leadership practices are continuing features of the centre. Since ERO’s 2012 report, robust self-review processes have been developed to further enhance learning outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children enjoy a strong sense of belonging and connection to the centre. They know the routines well and are supported to be independent in their play and learning. Children relate very well to each other. They are respectful of others’ choices and need for space. There are good opportunities for children to work collaboratively or to play on their own. Children use imaginative play and exploration to extend their learning. Children have many opportunities to problem solve. They actively initiate and lead their own play.</p>
<p>The environment is very well resourced. Children can readily access materials to support their interests. They are supported by teachers to extend their thinking, be creative, and to learn at their own pace. There is a genuine focus on environmental sustainability and learning activities that invite children to explore in natural surroundings. Children enjoy being involved in caring for plants in the centre’s gardens.</p>
<p>Teachers work well together as a cohesive team. Their calm interactions with children foster children’s wellbeing and learning. Teachers are very good at listening to children and asking openended questions to promote conversation and thinking skills. They talk about children’s preferences and interests.</p>
<p>Teachers know their parent community very well. There are many opportunities for teachers to provide leadership and to work collaboratively with a shared purpose. Teachers are strongly focused on positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Parents of children attending the centre appreciate the ways in which centre staff are culturally inclusive and show respect for children’s different backgrounds. Parents’ aspirations are sought and valued by teachers.</p>
<p>The curriculum reflects a commitment to promoting the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Its bicultural focus reflects the centre’s philosophy of inclusion. There is a collaborative planning process responding to children’s interests and strengths. Teachers discuss their observations of children’s learning and work together to extend these interests and strengths. Children’s individual portfolios are an attractive celebration of their achievements. Learning stories include a good balance of children’s individual and group learning. Format of these stories invites children and parent feedback to inform further long-term planning.</p>
<p>The head teacher leads the teaching team well. Her skilled, experienced and well considered leadership impacts positively on centre operations. She models and promotes lifelong learning and has sought relevant external professional support for teachers.</p>
<p>The management committee are well informed through regular reports about the centre’s progress. Comprehensive strategic and annual plans help committee members to make decisions about key centre priorities. They are committed to ensuring the centre meets its strategic goals. A strong policy framework enables the centre to respond efficiently to legislative changes.</p>
<p>Self-review is well understood and well documented. Changes to self-review processes have enabled staff to evaluate the effectiveness of their practice and make improvements to outcomes for children. Recent self review has identified ways in which teachers can further extend children’s learning.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>To enhance existing high quality practices the head teacher and teachers have identified that they could:</p>
<ul><li>deepen partnerships with parents to increase their involvement in the centre’s programme</li>
<li>strengthen the ways in which they promote ongoing educational success for Māori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edmonton Community Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Edmonton Community Kindergarten will be in four years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p>
<h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
