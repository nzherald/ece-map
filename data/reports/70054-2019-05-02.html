</table><p>Gleniti Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Gleniti Playcentre is a parent cooperative, where parents are encouraged to be involved in all aspects of the programme and centre operation. The service provides early childhood education for children aged from birth to six years. Infants, toddlers and young children play and learn in a mixed- age group setting. Gleniti Playcentre operates five morning sessions a week.</p><p>A paid educator works with the parent group to support the curriculum, relationships, parent education and good health and safety practices. The centre employs an administration worker to assist the centre with administration, including health and safety. Parents are encouraged to participate in playcentre education training to support them in their role.</p><p>The centre's philosophy and valued outcomes place an emphasis on the child and parent working together, and families participating in and leading the learning. The philosophy and valued outcomes reflect a commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>Gleniti Playcentre is one of 47 playcentres in the recently-formed South Island Southern Region (SISR) hub, which operates under the umbrella of the New Zealand Playcentre Federation (NZPF).</p><p>A parent council oversees the day-to-day running of the centre and each member has specific responsibilities. A centre support worker (CSW) from the SISR visits regularly to provide support. An experienced facilitator works with parents to support the provision of education and care for the children.</p><p>This review was part of a group of two SISR playcentre reviews. The playcentre organisation is nearing the end of an extensive restructure and review. From 2019, all playcentres will be part of a national group known as Playcentre Aotearoa.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The playcentre's philosophy and beliefs about teaching and learning are evident in centre programmes and practices. Parents are welcomed and valued as educators of their children, and are well supported to build an understanding of the playcentre philosophy and how children learn best. They work collaboratively and constructively to ensure ongoing improvements to outcomes for children.</p><p>Parents know their own and other children well in order to support their learning. They are highly responsive to individual needs. Parents follow children's interests and are actively involved in planning to support and extend learning across the breadth of the curriculum.</p><p>The curriculum is based around children's identified interests, which are extended through play-based learning. Children are involved in decisions about their learning programme and their learning environment. The centre's inclusive and nurturing environment provides good support for children's wellbeing and learning. There are plenty of opportunities to explore their interests and build their developing physical capabilities. They are confident in the mixed-age group setting of the centre which enables older children to play with and support younger ones.</p><p>The learning environment is well resourced and used. It supports learning across the curriculum areas. Resources are purposefully set out and used to encourage children's exploration, engagement and wonder.</p><p>The planning for individual children has been strengthened and is better promoting and supporting intended learning outcomes for children. Assessment and planning processes are now becoming more aligned to Te Whāriki, the NZ Early Childhood Curriculum (2017).</p><p>The centre has developed a useful process for self review. It is used to identify areas for improvement and develop plans to improve outcomes for children over time.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre has identified and ERO agrees that the next steps needed to ensure positive outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation, and guidelines for their use</li>
<li>develop ways to encourage parents to participate more in the self-review process</li>
<li>ensure self review is well linked to intended outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Governance</h3><p>NZPF has developed, and is implementing, a clear national and regional management structure. Some of the new roles have had a very positive impact at centre level, with parent council members valuing the increased support they receive.</p><p>Of particular significance are:</p><ul>
<li>the centre administrator role which provides sound monitoring of health, safety and compliance</li>
<li>the centre support worker who visits regularly to share best practice and monitor the quality of learning and teaching</li>
<li>the role and availability of a facilitator to role model good practice and empower parents to implement effective early childhood education for their children.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps for the SISR are to:</p><ul>
<li>refine and embed the new NZPF structure, systems and processes, including monitoring and lines of reporting</li>
<li>continue to develop and strengthen the NZPF and individual playcentre internal evaluation processes and practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Gleniti Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>2 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
