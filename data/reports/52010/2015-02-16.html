</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Halcombe Playcentre is one of 19 administered by the Central Districts Playcentre Association (the association). This review is one of ten undertaken by ERO in the association’s playcentres during Term 4, 2014.</p><p>This small, rural centre is open for two mornings a week and caters for children from birth to six years, though currently it has a younger group with most children being two to three years old. Responsibility for the day-to-day operations is undertaken by centre-elected office holders. A paid facilitator supports parents and whānau to develop and implement the daily programme. A liaison officer, employed by the association, provides professional advice and guidance to strengthen members’ practice. At the time of this review, all parents at this centre are undertaking Playcentre training.</p><p>Playcentres' philosophy statement, 'whānau tupu ngātahi – families growing together’, encapsulates the value this organisation places on families and whānau working collectively to support children’s learning. Halcombe Playcentre has positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation is currently reviewing the organisational structure of Playcentre across New Zealand. The association and centres are contributing to this review. The outcomes of this review may result in changes to operation at centre level.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Parents and whānau work very well together to plan and provide a stimulating and interesting range of experiences for children attending the centre. A high ratio of adults to children promotes opportunities for high quality interactions which support children to take risks in their learning and participate fully in the activities provided.</p><p>The centre is well resourced. The environment, both inside and outside is planned to arouse children’s interest and encourage them to explore. Equipment is available and accessible. There is a free flow of play among all areas. Adults work alongside children, ensuring they are supported in their play and providing additional equipment as needed or requested.</p><p>Currently, the centre has a younger group of children including babies and toddlers. Although there is a quiet area set aside for these children, they usually prefer to be part of the main play programme. The majority of planned activities are open-ended so that they may be fully explored by all children at their own pace and level.</p><p>Since the May 2012 ERO report, centre members have made good progress in integrating a bicultural perspective into the programme and environment. They have worked hard to increase their own knowledge of and confidence in, using te reo Māori. This was evident throughout the session observed, with adults interweaving the language naturally into their interactions with children, many of whom were able to respond in te reo Māori. A next step is for members to strengthen their understanding of te ao Māori.</p><p>Members are keen for the playcentre to strengthen its links with the local school. Frequent and open communication should assist a seamless transition process and an understanding of each other’s curriculum.</p><p>Planning is informed by session evaluations, individual children’s learning stories and parents’ ideas. These then translate into a flexible programme to support children’s learning. In children’s portfolios, learning stories are beginning to show a continuation of learning. A positive aspect of these stories is that they contain multiple voices, including those of parents and children.</p><p>Interactions are warm and positive. Literacy and mathematics are well integrated into play in meaningful ways. However, adults could further their development and use of learning conversations to extend children’s ideas, thinking skills and vocabulary.</p><p>All members are developing a greater awareness and understanding of the use of self review as a tool for improvement. Policies are reviewed annually and the strategic plan provides direction for ongoing centre development and growth. Members can now take a more evaluative approach to self review to determine not only what is happening but also the quality and effectiveness.</p><p>Useful support is provided by the association. This includes written guidelines and systems for managing finance and legislative obligations. Work is being completed to improve employment practices. Regular visits from the liaison officer assist members in their management and teaching roles. A review of the liaison officer role is being undertaken to support an improved approach.</p><p>The appraisal process, particularly for those employed as team leaders and liaison officers, needs further development. The provision of ongoing professional, constructive feedback based on observations of practice, and linked to identified needs and goals, should add rigour.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At association level, priorities are the further development of:</p><ul>
<li>members’ understanding of assessment, planning, evaluation and self review</li>
<li>a rigorous appraisal process for employees</li>
<li>members’ understanding about te ao Māori</li>
<li>understanding around the concept of success for Māori as Māori</li>
<li>strategies that promote awareness of Playcentre in the local community.</li>
</ul><p>At centre level, the priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop strategies to effectively promote success for Māori children as Māori</li>
<li>encourage adults to further use learning conversations to extend children’s ideas, thinking skills and vocabulary</li>
<li>develop a more evaluative approach to the use of self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Halcombe Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance:</p><p>The association should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>requirements for police vetting of employees are consistently met.<br><em>[</em><em>Education Act 1989, sections 78CB and</em> <em>CC]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Halcombe Playcentre will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>16 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
