</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Joyce Fisher Preschool, formerly known as The Hearing House Preschool, specialises in the education and care of children who are hearing impaired. These children travel from all over Auckland to attend the preschool. Children from the local community also participate in the learning programme. The preschool has a full-day licence for up to 20 children from 2 years to school age.</p><p>The preschool is part of The Hearing House (THH) organisation and is located on the same site in a new purpose-built preschool building. The organisation supports families and children by providing speech and developmental therapy following children's cochlea implant surgery. The Hearing House organisation provides governance support through its Chief Executive who is the service provider of the preschool. This connection means that children and their families experience a wraparound service.</p><p>The centre manager has responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the preschool. Both teachers are fully qualified early childhood teachers. They are assisted by a teacher aide and others who provide additional learning support for children. Teachers have identified valued outcomes for children. These include oral language development, self-help and independence skills, leadership and problem solving skills, and social competence.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, there have been significant staff changes, including the appointment of a new centre manager. The centre has increased its daily hours of operation to reflect the needs of its diverse community. Teachers have made good progress addressing the key next steps from ERO's previous review. They have developed a strategic plan that sets clear priorities for the preschool, implemented a new appraisal system, and are engaging in professional learning to support teachers' ongoing development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from the small group size in the calm, unhurried learning environment. They receive personalised education and care that supports their sense of belonging and wellbeing in the preschool. Children have many opportunities to extend their oral language, literacy and mathematics learning, and to develop their leadership skills.</p><p>Teachers are welcoming and inclusive of children and whānau. They encourage parents to be involved in the learning programme and keep them well informed about their child's progress and interests. Teachers assist parents to access the support needed for their children. Children with additional needs and their whānau are effectively supported.</p><p>Children experience respectful interactions with each other, their teachers and with other adults in the preschool. They work well in groups and alongside others as they solve learning problems. Children confidently choose their areas of play. They are settled and actively engaged in their learning. The environments are well-resourced and attractively presented.</p><p>Children eagerly participate in the carefully structured mat times. Teachers use this opportunity to build children's confidence by supporting them to lead waiata and familiar activities. They foster children's understanding of differences and empathy through discussions that help children to think deeply about their current topic of interest.</p><p>Teachers view children as competent and capable learners. They have high expectations of children and challenge them to think creatively and investigate ideas fully. Teachers provide a carefully prepared learning programme in response to children’s interests and abilities. They regularly use digital technology to research with children and to communicate with parents about their child's participation in the programme.</p><p>Teachers know children well. They encourage children to explain their ideas. Each child's contributions are valued. Teachers use intentional, deliberate teaching approaches to develop children's specific skills and knowledge.</p><p>Te ao Māori is evident in the learning environment and programme. Manaakitanga, whanaungatanga and aroha are well-established values. Teachers naturally incorporate te reo and tikanga Māori into the daily programme. They place a strong emphasis in the learning programme on Pacific and other cultures, to reflect their diverse community. Teachers purposefully include children's home languages where English is not the first language.</p><p>Transition into and out of the preschool is well managed and focused on the needs of each child and family. Leaders have established positive relationships with schools.</p><p>Teachers make use of an internal evaluation process to reflect on areas needing improvement. They engage in useful appraisal processes and an appropriate range of professional learning and development. Leadership is collaborative and teachers support each other to achieve the preschool's priorities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree the keys next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>integrate the preschool's commitment to Māori values and concepts more explicitly into key preschool documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>streamline assessment, planning and evaluation processes to make learning and teaching more visible in documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the evaluative aspects of internal evaluation by using the preschool's valued outcomes for children as a framework and regularly evaluate the strategic plan.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Joyce Fisher Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Joyce Fisher Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>5 July 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
