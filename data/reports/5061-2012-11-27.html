<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Kingsdene Kindergarten in Mangere, Auckland is a well established kindergarten that continues to promote children&rsquo;s wellbeing and provide quality early childhood experiences for all children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The kindergarten has had significant changes in leadership and hours of operation since ERO&rsquo;s 2009 review. In 2011, the licence changed to a full day model, allowing two additional staff members to be appointed and resulting in a steady increase to the centre&rsquo;s roll. A new acting head teacher leads the staff and has a collaborative approach to working with the teaching team, children, and families.</p><p>The service operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association, which provides a policy framework and good quality professional guidance for the teachers. An administrator, a teacher aide and a parent support group also assist teachers.</p><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy focuses on building partnership with parents, wh&#257;nau, and the culturally diverse centre community. Te Tiriti o Waitangi guides teachers&rsquo; commitment to bicultural practice.</p><p>Kingsdene Kindergarten has a history of positive ERO reports. This ERO report acknowledges the continued commitment of the new team to improving and promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in five early childhood education services within the Auckland Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers have improved the quality of the programme and learning opportunities for children. They value children&rsquo;s home languages, cultures and life experiences, and see these as a way to enrich the programme and their own professional practice.</p><p>The learning environment is attractive, with well defined areas of play to support children&rsquo;s engagement in the programme. New children settle quickly into the kindergarten. Children enjoy imaginative play and explore happily alongside each other. They can sustain their interest in play for long periods, both in group situations or alone. Routines provide a useful, but flexible framework for the day. Children&rsquo;s work is valued and attractively displayed.</p><p>Teachers&rsquo; respectful relationships with children and their wh&#257;nau are a strength of the centre. They continue to develop ways to increase parent and wh&#257;nau contribution in the centre&rsquo;s programme. Leadership is seen as a collaborative process, and teachers encourage and support children and their families to take on leadership roles and responsibilities in the kindergarten.</p><p>The cultures of children and teachers are acknowledged through the display of whakapapa. Children and their families enjoy cultural events and festivals celebrated in the centre. Children confidently initiate conversations with their peers and adults. Teachers sometimes use children&rsquo;s first language to converse with them. Children also respond well to teachers&rsquo; use of reo M&#257;ori and are familiar with waiata and karakia.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s portfolios show the progress and continuity of their learning over time. Teachers intentionally weave literacy, maths, science, and technology concepts into the programme to extend children&rsquo;s learning experiences. Children with special needs have individual programmes, and the good support they receive maximises their involvement in activities and their learning.</p><p>Positive support from the Association has been valuable in promoting a smooth transition for staff, children, and families to the changed hours of operation. Professional learning and development has helped the teaching team to develop shared understandings, goals, and plans for the future of the kindergarten.</p><p>The professional services manager (PSM) provides good liaison between the kindergarten and the Association. The PSM&rsquo;s regular visits and teaching reports raises teachers&rsquo; awareness of Association services, documentations, and expectations. Association leaders agree they should continue to help teachers to use their long-term planning to develop a more strategic approach to self review.</p><p>Teachers have identified appropriate priority areas for improving centre management, operation and administration. ERO agrees that the next steps are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>documentation processes for assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>self-review process, including consultation with families in ways that value their oral as well as their written feedback</li>
<li>appraisal goals to ensure they are improving and extending teachers&rsquo; professional practice and knowledge.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kingsdene Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>27 November 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
