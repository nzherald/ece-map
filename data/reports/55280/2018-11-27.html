</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Happy Days Child Care Centre Tamatea was previously known as Chipmunks Childcare Centre. The service was purchased by new owners in January 2018. The licensee also operates Happy Days Child Care Centre in Taradale.</p><p>The centre opens from 7:30am until 5:30pm. It is licensed for 27 children, including 11 up to the age of two years. There are 47 children on roll, including eight Māori children. The centre is a mixed-age environment with a separate area for infants and toddlers.</p><p>The February 2015 ERO report, under Chipmunks Childcare Centre Napier, identified key next steps as building leadership capacity and review and evaluation. Progress is ongoing.</p><p>Happy Days Child Care Centre opened with a new manager and teaching team. The manager is a provisionally registered teacher and is co-owner of the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy promotes a focus on relationships, learning through play, bicultural practice and exploration of a wide range of curriculum areas. Aspects of the philosophy are evident in practice. Children play and learn across all areas of the centre. Older children regularly visit their younger siblings. Relationships with parents and families are warm and responsive. There is a sense of whānau and friendship.</p><p>Teachers role model social skills and positive interactions. They support children to express opinions and use effective questioning techniques to extend their interest and learning. Children know what they do well and are encouraged to share their successes.</p><p>Infants and toddlers play and learn in a relaxed, calm environment. Responsive care-giving supports their need for security and consistency. Effective teaching strategies promote their emerging language skills and sense of self.</p><p>A system of planning and assessment of children's learning is in place. This records children's interests and participation in the programme. Some stories show children's learning and progress over time. A key next step is to strengthen assessment practice. This includes sharing expectations for teachers and promoting strategies to improve consistency across the teaching team.</p><p>A bicultural approach to supporting children's learning is visible in the environment, resources and routines. Some teachers speak te reo Māori naturally and frequently. Older children are learning their pepeha and some use kupu spontaneously in their play. Teachers and leaders recognise a need to strengthen their knowledge and understanding of supporting Māori children's learning.</p><p>Internal evaluation is in the early stages. Regular spontaneous review is evident and teachers reflect on their practice. A next step is for teachers to strengthen their knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation and begin to measure the impact of their teaching and curriculum on learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The appraisal process needs improvement to better support teachers to learn and grow their practice. Managers should ensure that appraisal meets the requirements of the Education Council. The centre manager should seek an appropriate appraiser.</p><p>Systems and processes that contribute to the smooth and efficient management of the centre are not yet well embedded. The manager needs further support to continue to develop her leadership and to more effectively implement quality control measures in regard to the curriculum and health and safety.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and ERO agree on the following key next steps for Happy Days Child Care Centre Tamatea:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>build teachers' knowledge and understanding of assessment for learning and internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support the centre manager to continue to develop her leadership capability.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Happy Days Child Care Centre Tamatea completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to management and health and safety.</p><p>To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>record keeping when children leave the premises on an excursion, including the assessment and management of risk</p>
</li>
<li>implementing suitable human resource management practices in relation to staff appraisal. <br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS17, GMA7]</em></li>
</ul><p>In order to improve practice leaders should strengthen practice in relation to accident and medication recording and more effectively monitor the implementation of health and safety practices. In addition, ensure that all toilets are readily accessible and safe for children. Since the on-site stage of the ERO review, the owners have responded quickly to address the health and safety concerns and the accessibility of the toilet.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Happy Days Child Care Centre Tamatea will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>27 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
