</td>
<td width="137">
<p>Very well placed</p>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>A Kidz World Home Based Childcare &amp; Education Service provides education and care for children from birth to school age in educators' home environments. Children are cared for and learn in small family-like groups of up to four children, with a maximum of two under the age of two years. The service operates in the Bay of Plenty and Waikato regions. It is licensed for 80 children including 40 up to the age of two years. At the time of this ERO review the service operated with 13 educators and a roll of 43 of whom eight identified as being M&#257;ori.</p>
<p>The service is privately owned and overseen by a managing director who also operates a home-based network in Auckland. Educators are well supported by a coordinator who is a qualified and experienced early childhood teacher. She regularly visits children in educators' homes. A significant feature of this service is the high numbers of educators who hold formal early childhood education qualifications.</p>
<p>Since the previous ERO review in 2011, a new coordinator has been appointed and many new educators have joined the service.</p>
<p>The service's philosophy makes a commitment to treating children as individuals and supporting them to develop learning dispositions that enable them to become competent, confident learners, and communicators.</p>
<p>The service has a positive ERO reporting history.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>A Kidz World Home-Based Education and Care Service is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Children experience a rich and varied programme in educators' homes and within their local communities that responds to their interests. Particular features of the programme include:</p>
<ul><li>the natural integration of literacy and mathematics into children's play</li>
<li>opportunities for children to express their creativity through imaginative play and visual arts experiences</li>
<li>regular trips into the wider community that provide meaningful contexts for learning</li>
<li>opportunities for children to learn and play in small family like groups that promote positive social interactions and relationships.</li>
</ul><p>Educators work in partnership with parents to follow personalised care routines, particularly for infants and toddlers. They document key aspects of infants' sleeping, toileting, and eating routines that they share daily with parents.</p>
<p>The managing director and coordinator have developed useful systems and procedures to guide service operations. These systems support educators to meet service expectations for providing high-quality education and care. A wide range of toys, resources, and equipment is made available by the service for educators to enhance children's learning and care experiences. The managing director accesses external learning opportunities for the coordinator to continue to develop her professional practice. Educators also have opportunities to participate in professional development facilitated by the coordinator as well as external providers.</p>
<p>In response to the 2011 ERO report, service leaders have undertaken professional development about building self-review practices. In consultation with educators they have reviewed service policies and implemented some useful reviews of administration systems.</p>
<p>Educators appreciate the advice and guidance that they receive from the coordinator. She is easily accessible to educators, and monitors systems that guide them to provide a safe learning environment for children. The coordinator models effective assessment practices for educators and supports them to provide a programme that extends children's interests and learning.</p>
<p>Educators and the coordinator develop well-presented individual child portfolios that provide children and their families with a valuable record of each child's experiences in the programme. ERO cited examples of high-quality portfolios completed by qualified educators that effectively captured children's learning, progress and development.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>The key next steps for the service are to:</p>
<ul><li>strengthen the documented feedback from the coordinator to educators about the quality of their interactions with children, programme and assessment practices</li>
<li>provide support for educators to strengthen the place of M&#257;ori language, culture and identity in the programme</li>
<li>continue to develop these self-review practices to enable them to more effectively evaluate how well the service is meeting its stated goals for quality education and care.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of A Kidz World Home Based Childcare &amp; Education Service completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their</p>
<p>legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of A Kidz World Home Based Childcare &amp; Education Service will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO&rsquo;s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s overarching question for an early childhood education review is &lsquo;How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?&rsquo; ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework Ng&#257; Pou Here:</p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou &#256;rahi</em> &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>M&#257;tauranga</em> &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p>
<h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<p>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</p>
<p>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</p>
<p>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</p>
<p>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on ERO&rsquo;s website.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
