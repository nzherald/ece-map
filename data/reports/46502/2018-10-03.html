</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sunny Side Early Educare is a privately owned, full day education and care service located near the Waikato hospital in central Hamilton. The centre is licensed for 42 children including 12 up to the age of two years. Its roll of 50 includes two Māori, 17 Indian and 13 Filipino children.</p><p>The centre owner is a fully-qualified early childhood teacher. She undertakes the role of centre manager and is supported by an experienced head teacher to provide professional leadership to the teaching team. The centre operates two age-based rooms for babies and toddlers, and pre-schoolers. Both rooms share the same outdoor environment.</p><p>The centre philosophy expresses commitment to providing a fun, creative and friendly environment that celebrates and values diverse cultures. Children are encouraged to respect others, use their initiative and to develop self confidence and a positive attitude towards learning.</p><p>The centre owner has accessed external advice and guidance to support the centre to address areas for development identified in the 2017 ERO report. This has resulted in the development of a more robust performance management process, meaningful self-review systems and clear human resource policies and practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre manager is promoting a collaborative and well-considered approach for centre-wide improvement. She has established clearly defined roles and responsibilities for staff, implemented an ongoing process for self review and has developed a useful appraisal process for teachers. Centre leaders model good-quality teaching practices and access relevant professional development opportunities for teachers. Well-informed leadership is contributing to improved outcomes for children. Leaders should consider accessing further guidance to support the implementation of the revised NZ early childhood curriculum <em>Te Whariki</em>.</p><p>The responsive curriculum is promoting positive learning outcomes for children. Child-led programmes encourage the development of independence. Tuakana teina relationships are promoted by toddler's ready access to the older children’s room and the shared outdoor play space. Teachers successfully integrate aspects of reading and numeracy into daily programmes. A range of appropriate resources support children's learning and development. Individual portfolios are easily accessed by children and are well used to identify individual progress and achievement. These are also available for parents in a digital format. Cultural celebrations including Matariki and Diwali effectively support children’s sense of belonging.</p><p>Teachers work well together in the best interests of children. They plan together to respond to children's interests and wellbeing. Positive relationships have been established between teachers and children, parents and whānau. Teachers have an understanding of each child as a unique learner and effectively support children’s sense of belonging. Children benefit from the variety of strengths and abilities teachers bring to the centre and enjoy participating in individual, group and whole-centre activities.</p><p>The provision of education and care for children up to two years of age is positive, sensitive and responsive. Teachers recognise learning opportunities and integrate learning in care routines. They interact with young children in a calm, unhurried way giving them time and space to lead their learning. Purposeful resourcing supports children’s learning.</p><p>Parents spoken to by ERO were well informed about their children's learning and wellbeing. They expressed high levels of confidence in teachers to provide an environment where each child is respected and valued as an individual.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre management agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further build teacher capability to implement programmes that fully engage and extend children in meaningful learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen the integration of bi-cultural and multi-cultural perspectives in daily learning experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop the centre’s outdoor environment to provide greater opportunities for children to explore and experience safe physical challenge.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sunny Side Early Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice the centre owner and teachers need to design and implement a schedule for regular policy reviews.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Sunny Side Early Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Adrienne Fowler</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>3 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
