</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pukeko Preschool Pakuranga Heights is located within the grounds of Pakuranga Heights School. It provides all-day care and education for up to 39 children from a wide variety of cultural backgrounds, and has become an integral part of the school’s community. Eleven children are Māori and seven are of Pacific nationalities. The teaching team is also culturally diverse.</p><p>Children have good access from the main playroom and enclosed deck area to the outdoor learning environment. There is a separate space with its own outdoor play area for up to 10 children under two years of age.</p><p>In February 2013 the owners opened Pukeko Preschool Pakuranga Heights in a building that had previously been used by another early childhood service. They have made significant improvements, including new bathroom facilities, display surfaces and furniture.</p><p>The owners support the manager and teaching team to explore ways to improve their practice. They foster close working relationships with their Pukeko Preschool in Mangere. One of the owners, the manager and four teachers hold early childhood education qualifications. They are supported by three unqualified staff. One of the teaching team is a fully registered teacher.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have friendly relationships with each other and interact well together. They play both independently and cooperatively, and direct their own imaginative ideas. Infants and toddlers are well cared for in a warm and nurturing atmosphere. Whānau talked with ERO about good relationships with the teaching team and a sense of being included and belonging in the centre.</p><p>Teachers work closely with children and support their play well. They are becoming more skilled at engaging children in extended conversations to support their learning. Teachers use some good literacy learning practices throughout the programme. Children experiment with drawing and writing, and enjoy books independently. Their stories are often recorded. Teachers should now extend these good practices. The centre’s close association with the school supports smooth transitions for children when they turn five.</p><p>Displays in the centre celebrate children’s creative work and provide useful information for whānau. The influence of the Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education is apparent in attractively presented play areas, both outdoors and inside. The outdoor area has interesting garden spaces, a good level of physical challenge and resources to support children’s learning. Children help to care for the centre’s chickens and have good opportunities to explore in the outdoors.</p><p>Teachers include cultural celebrations in the programme and use some te reo Māori phrases. They could now consider how to increase their recognition and inclusion of children’s cultural backgrounds and home languages in assessment records and planning for individual children. Teachers are considering ways to strengthen their partnerships with whānau, to support children’s learning.</p><p>Teachers have established a useful cycle of assessment, planning and evaluation. Some examples show their good practices in recording and recognising children’s learning. Teachers are now trialling new assessment and planning processes as part of strategies for establishing a more child-led learning programme. Professional support and more purposeful planning and evaluation should help teachers to respond better to children’s individual interests and strengths.</p><p>The owner currently leads curriculum developments and encourages teachers to reflect on and improve their teaching practice. In-depth review of the centre’s philosophy of teaching and learning, and the development of indicators to guide teaching practice, would support greater shared understandings and consistent teaching practices across the centre.</p><p>Processes for self review have recently been improved and teachers are becoming more familiar with expectations. Good governance and management systems, and strategic planning, guide centre operations. The owners are focused on ongoing learning and improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>As part of this review, owners have identified appropriate next steps for centre development. They recognise the value of:</p><ul>
<li>increasing the depth and rigour of their own and teachers’ self review, to continually adapt and improve centre practices</li>
<li>better aligning their vision, mission statement and philosophy for the centre with strategic and annual plans, and programme implementation</li>
<li>strengthening programme planning and evaluation to support more complex and extended learning for children.</li>
</ul><p>The owners should also prioritise improved levels of teacher training. They should consider accessing external support for teachers to become fully registered, and to strengthen curriculum leadership within the centre.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pukeko Preschool Pakuranga Heights completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pukeko Preschool Pakuranga Heights will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>10 June 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
