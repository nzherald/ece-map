<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>PORSE (Play, Observe, Relate, Support, Extend, Evaluate) is an in-home early childhood organisation with its National Support Office located in Hawkes Bay. Area offices are located throughout New Zealand. Within the area offices, PORSE personnel, including coaches and programme tutors, work with parents, nannies and home educators to provide early childhood education and care for infants, toddlers and young children. Children are cared for in their own homes or in small groups in the home of their educator.</p><p>The PORSE mission is &ldquo;to have all people in New Zealand schooled in nurturing and educating children in their care.&rdquo; Families are valued partners in children&rsquo;s education and care.</p><p>PORSE Whangarei S1 is one of two PORSE networks in the Whangarei office, which was established in September 2009. This review of the PORSE Whangarei focuses on the quality of care and education, and partnerships with wh&#257;nau. Educators provide care and education for 86 children.</p><p>Programme tutors, who are registered teachers, have primary responsibility for children&rsquo;s learning. They provide support, encouragement and information for in-home educators, and also facilitate courses for educators and school students engaged in early childhood work experience. PORSE offers opportunities for educators to share their practice, support each other and participate in professional development courses.</p><p>Home environments are generally well resourced and children enjoy varied and stimulating experiences that build on their interests and prior knowledge. Educators are encouraged to take advantage of community facilities, PORSE playschools, and other group activities that enable children to develop friendships with peers and work alongside a variety of adults. PORSE also encourages educators to make the most of natural environments. Refocusing assessment, planning and reflective practice on children&rsquo;s learning could help programme tutors to enrich outcomes for children in both home and playschool environments. This focus is likely to result in more targeted and purposeful support for educators.</p><p>Parents/wh&#257;nau select their children&rsquo;s educators. They have direct day-to-day relationships with educators and are well informed about their children&rsquo;s daily activities. Parents/wh&#257;nau surveyed by ERO report that they are generally happy with the services offered by PORSE. Staff in Whangarei have a strategic goal to increase the participation of wh&#257;nau M&#257;ori in PORSE opportunities. Staff agree that to enhance the educational success of M&#257;ori children, there is further work to do in improving provision for the children and their wh&#257;nau.</p><p>A next step for Whangarei staff is to continue increasing the rigour of their self review. More robust evaluation could assist programme tutors to make ongoing improvements in the support they provide for children&rsquo;s learning. It could be useful for PORSE to review its support for programme tutors to enable them to refocus their work on enhancing outcomes for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of PORSE Whangarei S1 was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by PORSE Whangarei S1 to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the service (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atPORSE Whangarei S1.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
<li>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>This review of the PORSE Whangarei office is informed by organisational and local documentation, visits to homes selected by PORSE, interviews with educators and PORSE staff, written feedback from parents, and observations of programmes for children.</p><p>In the PORSE Whangarei Area Office a team approach means that all staff have direct contact with families and educators to support enrolment, induction and office administration.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><p><em>Diverse learning environments.</em> Children are settled in familiar home environments that are mostly well resourced and offer good access to indoor and outdoor play spaces. Most children also enjoy a wide variety of additional environments and have opportunities to relate with others in the community. When educators make use of community facilities and attend regular PORSE playschools children are able to develop friendships and skills that support social interaction. A &lsquo;NatureLIVE&rsquo; playschool focuses on natural resources and surroundings.</p><p><em>Family relationships.</em> Warm, caring attachments with educators result in children being confident and comfortable with others and showing a sense of security and belonging. Close, trusting relationships, and daily interaction between families and educators, are positive features that assist educators to be responsive to the needs and aspirations of wh&#257;nau, and to discuss shared strategies for working with children. Educators&rsquo; very good knowledge about the children in their care is often reflected in journals, which provide parents/wh&#257;nau with good information about children&rsquo;s day-to-day activities. Parents/wh&#257;nau surveyed by ERO report that they are generally happy with PORSE arrangements and the programmes provided for their children.</p><p><em>Building educator capability.</em> PORSE resources, and their approval and training programmes, are designed to motivate educators to further develop children&rsquo;s education and their own personal growth. Educators have diverse backgrounds and training levels, and are well supported to build their capability. Programme tutors provide affirming, encouraging support and often assist educators to identify strategies for managing specific situations. There are opportunities for skilled educators to share their practice with those who are less experienced. Educator support and training is intended to contribute to the continual improvement of programmes for children.</p><p>Good practices observed in home programmes include:</p><ul>
<li>varied and stimulating experiences that build on children&rsquo;s interests and prior knowledge and provide good opportunities for literacy and numeracy learning;</li>
<li>good support for children&rsquo;s language development, and opportunities for children to engage in conversations and interactions that foster their learning; and</li>
<li>daily journals and programme journals that show how educators respond to what they notice about children&rsquo;s learning and emerging interests, and make links to Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum.</li>
</ul><p><em>Developing team approaches and reflective practice.</em> The PORSE organisation has a variety of methods for monitoring and collecting information to review its operations. Staff and educators are encouraged to maintain reflective journals. Some are beginning to critique their practice and are responsive to needs or gaps identified through their reflections. Team approaches to reflective practice are at the early stages of development.</p><p>PORSE is currently reviewing and strengthening processes for educator approval and training and for the induction and appraisal of programme tutors. Recent steps have been taken to revisit policies. These reviews should help to ensure that the requirements of PORSE and relevant regulations are well understood, and that appropriate tools and support are provided for all personnel.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p><em>Strategic and action planning.</em> The Whangarei office team has identified goals for development in the region. It could be worthwhile for the team to plan strategically how to achieve and build on those goals over time. A purposeful, staged approach to implementation could help to ensure that good practices are sustainable.</p><p><em>Robust self review.</em> PORSE staff agree that a next step for them is to establish processes for systematic and in-depth review of their practices. Review should be improvement focused. More robust review of all aspects of their work, particularly the impact of their work on outcomes for children, could assist staff to make their support for educators, and for children&rsquo;s learning, more targeted and purposeful.</p><p><em>Programme tutor role.</em> After a period of focus on building PORSE training programmes, the organisation has identified the need to refocus its attention on the quality of in-home programmes provided for children. It could be useful to review and clarify the role and responsibilities of programme tutors in this regard. Support for programme tutors to increase their knowledge about current theories and developments in early childhood education, and to help them to refocus their work on outcomes for children, could also be worthwhile.</p><p><em>Child and educator records.</em> PORSE personnel do not have good records of educator capabilities and development, or of individual children&rsquo;s learning progress. Records of regular communications between programme tutors and parents/wh&#257;nau should be more detailed and readily accessible. Improved records would assist programme tutors, particularly new staff, to provide continuity and targeted support for educators and for children&rsquo;s learning. Good records provide assurance for PORSE that its requirements and legal obligations are being met.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service;</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children;</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p>Programme tutors and educators in Whangarei have responsibility for the care and education of twenty children of M&#257;ori descent. The PORSE M&#257;ori as Tangata Whenua policy promotes connections with M&#257;ori communities and professional development for staff on the application of the principles of te Tiriti o Waitangi. It aims to increase M&#257;ori participation and to have the bicultural nature of New Zealand reflected in training programmes.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Wh&#257;nau M&#257;ori benefit from the close relationships and ongoing communication between educators and families noted above in this report. Positive features of PORSE operations are its encouragement and support for wh&#257;nau educators to care for children within the wh&#257;nau and to participate in PORSE training. One of the two programme tutors is M&#257;ori and is proactive in her support for M&#257;ori home educators.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p><em>Documentation.</em> Educators&rsquo; discussions with wh&#257;nau could be more frequently and explicitly included in family manuals, programme tutor records and children&rsquo;s journals. Records could be kept of ways in which educators and programme tutors value and respond to children&rsquo;s cultural heritage and input from wh&#257;nau. These good practices are likely to help develop more effective partnerships that support children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p><em>Review of policy and practice.</em> It would be worthwhile for PORSE Whangarei personnel to review their implementation of the PORSE M&#257;ori as Tangata Whenua policy and to establish relationships and consultation with local M&#257;ori communities. They could also consider ways to ensure that the bicultural nature of Aotearoa/New Zealand is included to a greater extent in home and playschool programmes for children.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of PORSE Whangarei S1 completed an ERO Home-Based CareManagement Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practice, PORSE should establish systems for hazard identification and management and ensure that all practicable steps are taken to eliminate, isolate, or minimise hazards in homes and other environments where educators provide care and education for children.</p><p>Managers must ensure that police vetting of adults in homes where care and education is provided is undertaken before children are placed in that environment.</p><a id="5-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Recommendations</h2><p>ERO, the PORSE coach and programme tutors agree that it could be worthwhile for the service to:</p><p>5.1 develop a strategic plan to guide development in the Whangarei office;5.2 implement processes for systematic, in-depth self review that focuses on the quality of outcomes for children; and5.3 review policies and practices against Ministry of Education strategic plans and ERO&rsquo;s evaluation reports and indicators of good practice to support success for M&#257;ori children.</p><a id="6-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6. Future Action</h2><p>ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-porse-whangarei-s1" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of PORSE Whangarei S1</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report onPORSE (Play, Observe, Relate, Support, Extend, Evaluate) is an in-home early childhood organisation with its National Support Office located in Hawkes Bay. Area offices are located throughout New Zealand. Within the area offices, PORSE personnel, including coaches and programme tutors, work with parents, nannies and home educators to provide early childhood education and care for infants, toddlers and young children. Children are cared for in their own homes or in small groups in the home of their educator. The PORSE mission is &ldquo;to have all people in New Zealand schooled in nurturing and educating children in their care.&rdquo; Families are valued partners in children&rsquo;s education and care.</p><p>PORSE Whangarei S1 is one of two PORSE networks in the Whangarei office, which was established in September 2009. This review of the PORSE Whangarei focuses on the quality of care and education, and partnerships with wh&#257;nau. Educators provide care and education for 86 children.</p><p>Programme tutors, who are registered teachers, have primary responsibility for children&rsquo;s learning. They provide support, encouragement and information for in-home educators, and also facilitate courses for educators and school students engaged in early childhood work experience. PORSE offers opportunities for educators to share their practice, support each other and participate in professional development courses.</p><p>Home environments are generally well resourced and children enjoy varied and stimulating experiences that build on their interests and prior knowledge. Educators are encouraged to take advantage of community facilities, PORSE playschools, and other group activities that enable children to develop friendships with peers and work alongside a variety of adults. PORSE also encourages educators to make the most of natural environments. Refocusing assessment, planning and reflective practice on children&rsquo;s learning could help programme tutors to enrich outcomes for children in both home and playschool environments. This focus is likely to result in more targeted and purposeful support for educators.</p><p>Parents/wh&#257;nau select their children&rsquo;s educators. They have direct day-to-day relationships with educators and are well informed about their children&rsquo;s daily activities. Parents/wh&#257;nau surveyed by ERO report that they are generally happy with the services offered by PORSE. Staff in Whangarei have a strategic goal to increase the participation of wh&#257;nau M&#257;ori in PORSE opportunities. Staff agree that to enhance the educational success of M&#257;ori children, there is further work to do in improving provision for the children and their wh&#257;nau.</p><p>A next step for Whangarei staff is to continue increasing the rigour of their self review. More robust evaluation could assist programme tutors to make ongoing improvements in the support they provide for children&rsquo;s learning. It could be useful for PORSE to review its support for programme tutors to enable them to refocus their work on enhancing outcomes for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood service we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the service or see the ERO website, www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information About Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood services; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each service&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a service, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contribute to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this service has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this service.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a service is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this service.</p></html>
