</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Foxton Beach provides education and care for 30 children aged over two years, five days a week. At the time of this ERO review, 43 children were enrolled including 10 who identify as Māori.</p><p>A business manager and professional services manager oversee the service. Day-to-day operation of the centre is the responsibility of the centre manager, who supports teaching staff. Most teachers are fully qualified. Some staff and leadership changes have occurred since the March 2014 ERO report.</p><p>ABC Foxton Beach is owned and operated by BestStart Educare Ltd. BestStart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large national organisation that owns early childhood services across New Zealand.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified areas requiring improvement. These involved promoting Māori children's culture and identity, and improving assessment, planning and evaluation processes. Further development in these areas is required.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from interactions with motivated, reflective teachers. Staff regularly discuss their strategies. They work alongside children, encouraging their leadership, scientific thinking and creativity. Routines are flexible to individual children's preferences. Environmental sustainability is meaningfully integrated into the curriculum.</p><p>Programme planning is based on emergent group interests. These plans support teachers to maintain consistent practices and a varied curriculum of activities and events. Leaders and teachers should now prioritise the development of a clear cycle of assessment, planning and evaluation for individual children. Portfolios should clearly show how:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>intentional teaching has an impact on the progress of individual children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teaching has drawn on learning partnerships with parents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers respond meaningfully to children's cultures, languages and identities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers access outside agencies to support the learning of children with diverse needs. The progress of these children should be clearly monitored through assessment documentation.</p><p>A thoughtful process is in place for welcoming new children and families into the centre. A range of useful strategies support children's successful transition to school. A strong relationship with the local school has been established, including reciprocal visits from school and centre staff and children.</p><p>The teaching team has engaged in professional learning to improve the bicultural curriculum. Te ao Māori is visible in the centre environment, and aspects of tikanga Māori are evident in the programme. A next step is to increase the use of te reo Māori in conversations with children, as well as through assessment documentation.</p><p>Leaders acknowledge that targeted strategies to promote the educational success of Māori children should be further developed. Teachers should draw on their positive relationships with whānau Māori, to establish culturally responsive learning partnerships.</p><p>Self review is collaborative and appropriately focused on children. A key next step is to make the process more robust. Leaders should support teachers to strengthen the evaluative aspect of reviews through:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>narrowing the scope of evaluations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using a small number of focused indicators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gathering a range of evidence to inform judgements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating the impact of any changes made, using the indicators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitoring that impact over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>An appraisal process is in place. A next step is to consistently implement the appraisal practices within the BestStart policy.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that the key next steps are to develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>individual children's assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers' use of te reo Māori in conversations and in documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a range of strategies for promoting the educational success of Māori children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to further develop appraisal and review/internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>BestStart Educare should support staff to give priority to these key next steps and to embed new learning.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>Leaders agree with ERO's recommendation that they develop an action plan, clearly outlining how they will address the next steps identified in this report. ERO will monitor the centre's progress against this plan.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Foxton Beach completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Foxton Beach will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>13 June 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
