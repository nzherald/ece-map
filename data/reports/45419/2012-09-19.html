<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">New Shoots Children&rsquo;s Centre - Albany is located in Rosedale Road, Albany in Auckland&rsquo;s North Shore. This purpose-built centre is innovatively designed to reflect the centre&rsquo;s distinctive philosophy. The owner is an experienced educator within the early childhood sector. Highly effective leadership is a key feature of this service.</p><p align="left">The centre provides good quality education and care for children, from infants to pre-school. The centre&rsquo;s ambience is relaxed, inclusive and welcoming. Managers and teachers promote productive learning partnerships between centre staff, parents and children. Parents&rsquo; contributions are included in the centre&rsquo;s self-review processes that are well used to enhance educational outcomes for children.</p><p align="left">The high quality of care children receive from staff positively fosters their social and emotional well being. Children benefit from affirming, warm relationships with their teachers. Children are happily engaged and involved in their play as they acquire the foundation skills for effective learning. Good quality conversations and interactions between teachers and children are evident. Relevant and appropriate prompts for learning characterise teachers&rsquo; questioning techniques. There is a consistent emphasis across the centre on toddlers and pre-school children becoming self-managing.</p><p align="left">The progression of each child&rsquo;s learning is documented in either the nursery diaries for infants, or in children&rsquo;s portfolios. Teachers plan effective learning programmes for toddlers and pre-schoolers around identified individual or group interests. The centre&rsquo;s planning for babies is focused on the development of dispositions and milestones. All of the learning rooms are designed to be appealing and stimulating for the age group concerned.</p><p align="left">There is a professional and reflective culture among the centre&rsquo;s highly effective staff. Teachers are well supported in their role with good quality professional development that is tailored to the centre&rsquo;s needs. Managers and teachers make good use of early childhood education research, both national and international, to promote learning outcomes for children. This professional knowledge helps to shape the development of children&rsquo;s learning using new and innovative perspectives.</p><p align="left">Rigorous self review is undertaken at all levels of centre operations and systems. Review processes and their resulting outcomes reflect the centre&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to quality education and care for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of New Shoots Children's Centre - Albany was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at New Shoots Children's Centre - Albany.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">New Shoots Children&rsquo;s Centre - Albany is a new service in the Albany area and this is the centre&rsquo;s first report from the Education Review Office. Policies and systems are well established for staff to manage this service effectively.</p><p align="left">New Shoots Ltd owns three early childhood services and their management team provides considerable support for teachers and staff at the New Shoots Children&rsquo;s Centre - Albany.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left"><strong>Self review</strong>. Self review is continuous and includes contributions from staff, children, parents and wh&#257;nau. Outcomes for children always drive the centre&rsquo;s self-review processes. Response to self review is rapid, effective and progressive.</p><p align="left"><strong>Leadership.</strong> The centre benefits from highly effective leadership and management supported by the New Shoots Ltd organisation. Leaders are supportive of the promotion of their own capable staff. The work culture is positive and collegial.</p><p align="left"><strong>Parent voice</strong>. Family and wh&#257;nau have a central role in achieving positive learning outcomes for children. Parent feedback is used to help inform planning and review of the centre&rsquo;s systems, operations and educational direction.</p><p align="left"><strong>Teachers&rsquo; professional practice</strong>. Teachers are skilled, purposeful facilitators of learning for children and their programmes are responsive to individual and group interests. Teachers work in closely-knit, highly effective, collaborative teams.</p><p align="left"><strong>Programme planning and assessment</strong>. Teachers support children&rsquo;s emerging interests and plan learning experiences for individuals and for groups. Portfolios clearly show individual learning pathways for each child. Literacy and numeracy strategies are integrated effectively and frequently into children&rsquo;s activities and their play.</p><p align="left"><strong>Creative learning environment</strong>. In the babies&rsquo; and toddlers&rsquo; rooms the style of environment evokes a quiet and settled home. For the older children play areas are brighter and more colourful, inviting exploration. A variety of good quality equipment and resources are accessible to children.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori. Centre staff are interested in professional development to extend their knowledge of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in order to enrich children&rsquo;s understandings about New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage.</p><p align="left">Pre-school programme direction. Teachers are preparing to review the pre-school learning programme as they consider some different and creative ideas that will enhance learning for children making the transition to school.</p><p align="left">Programme enrichment opportunities. The centre is developing a focus around creative thinking, the use of information technology for children and problem solving skills to further strengthen the innovative approaches used in learning programmes.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of New Shoots Children's Centre - Albany completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2><p align="left">ERO and the centre managers agree that teachers should continue to use self-review to enhance and develop their high quality teaching and learning practices.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table style="width: 568px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>

This purpose-built centre is innovatively designed to reflect the centre&rsquo;s distinctive philosophy. The owner is an experienced educator within the early childhood sector. Highly effective leadership is a key feature of this service.</p><p align="left">The centre provides good quality education and care for children, from infants to pre-school. The centre&rsquo;s ambience is relaxed, inclusive and welcoming. Managers and teachers promote productive learning partnerships between centre staff, parents and children. Parents&rsquo; contributions are included in the centre&rsquo;s self-review processes that are well used to enhance educational outcomes for children.</p><p align="left">The high quality of care children receive from staff positively fosters their social and emotional well being. Children benefit from affirming, warm relationships with their teachers. Children are happily engaged and involved in their play as they acquire the foundation skills for effective learning. Good quality conversations and interactions between teachers and children are evident. Relevant and appropriate prompts for learning characterise teachers&rsquo; questioning techniques. There is a consistent emphasis across the centre on toddlers and pre-school children becoming self-managing.</p><p align="left">The progression of each child&rsquo;s learning is documented in either the nursery diaries for infants, or in children&rsquo;s portfolios. Teachers plan effective learning programmes for toddlers and pre-schoolers around identified individual or group interests. The centre&rsquo;s planning for babies is focused on the development of dispositions and milestones. All of the learning rooms are designed to be appealing and stimulating for the age group concerned.</p><p align="left">There is a professional and reflective culture among the centre&rsquo;s highly effective staff. Teachers are well supported in their role with good quality professional development that is tailored to the centre&rsquo;s needs. Managers and teachers make good use of early childhood education research, both national and international, to promote learning outcomes for children. This professional knowledge helps to shape the development of children&rsquo;s learning using new and innovative perspectives.</p><p align="left">Rigorous self review is undertaken at all levels of centre operations and systems. Review processes and their resulting outcomes reflect the centre&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to quality education and care for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p></html>
