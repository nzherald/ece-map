</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>St Lukes Shopper’s Creche operates as a casual care and education facility for children from two to five years of age. Scentre Group provide this service for up to two hours while parents use the shopping mall. The group’s purpose is to ‘Create extraordinary places connecting and enriching communities’.</p><p>This well-established creche has a staff who collaboratively promote a respectful creche culture. Children are skilfully transitioned by teachers into the creche. Some children visit regularly and many other children are new arrivals to the creche.</p><p>A range of personnel provide good quality governance and effective leadership to support the operation of the creche. Regular professional learning opportunities are provided for staff to guide the development of teaching practice.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report acknowledged teachers’ respectful relationships with children and how they considered children as competent and capable learners. Well-documented planning and assessment, and opportunities for children to develop early literacy skills were also identified as strengths. These features continue to be evident. Areas identified for review and development have been improved.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre’s philosophy is reflected in practice and in the evident responsive and caring relationships. Children, parents and whānau are warmly welcomed when they arrive. This helps children settle quickly into the creche. Teachers’ focused, unhurried interactions with children support their sense of connection in the creche.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor environments have been upgraded. The inviting outdoor area offers children a range of equipment and resources designed to capture their interests and meet their learning needs. Play options are offered to develop children’s physical coordination, strength and agility. Children can create art, explore and enjoy a variety of quiet and intimate spaces. ERO observed individual children and groups of children happily engaged in sustained and imaginative play.</p><p>Teachers provide high quality support for children’s play. They help them build new understandings and make connections to who they are and their prior experiences. Teachers recognise and respond to children’s cultural backgrounds. Their commitment to developing a more multi-cultural curriculum and resourcing could support the languages, cultures and identities of all children.</p><p>Programmes reflect the centre philosophy and principles of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Teachers observe and identify the emerging interests and themes evident in children's play. This helps teachers to provide opportunities for children to explore and initiate their own learning. Providing more challenging opportunities for older children could extend their learning.</p><p>Teachers access external professional guidance to help them cater for individual children with diverse learning strengths and needs. Teachers' attentive and reflective approaches are resulting in successful outcomes for children.</p><p>Records and photos of children’s learning identify children’s interests and engagement in their play. These are shared through email with parents who respond with feedback. This increases parents’ contribution to their child’s learning. It also creates more meaningful partnerships with teachers.</p><p>The knowledgeable head teacher works collaboratively with staff to support an effective teaching team. Teachers reflect on their practice and consider ways to improve programmes for children. These approaches enable teachers to continue providing good quality care and education for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers acknowledge that next steps could include ensuring all teachers are appropriately appraised in relation to the <em>Practising Teacher Criteria</em>.</p><p>The Scentre Group, in its governance role in the centre, recognises the value of more formally collaborating with creche staff.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of St Lukes Shopper's Creche completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should ensure all creche policies align with 2008 Education Regulations.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of St Lukes Shopper's Creche will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>9 October 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
