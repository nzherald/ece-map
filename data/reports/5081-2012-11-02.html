<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Northbridge Kindergarten is reasonably well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. New initiatives and strengthening self review will help teachers to sustain and build on current good practices.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Northbridge Kindergarten is situated in Northcote. It provides a kindergarten school-day model (KDM) of six hour days and provides for a mixed age group of children. Many of the children attend just morning sessions, with a small percentage staying for the afternoon. The kindergarten is situated close to public services and a shopping mall on a gently sloping section that provides space for outdoor play.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA), which provides operational and health and safety manuals as well as professional and administrative personnel assistance. The kindergarten is capably led by a head teacher and a cohesive and dedicated teaching team. A wh&#257;nau support group, made up of parents and helpers, organises fund raising and helps to keep the kindergarten tidy and welcoming.</p><p>Children attending the kindergarten come from the local area and represent a rich mix of cultures. As well as welcoming these families into the kindergarten, teachers also focus on modelling, promoting, and supporting children&rsquo;s understanding of biculturalism. There is a significant emphasis on using te reo M&#257;ori and fostering tikanga M&#257;ori as part of everyday practices. Children and their families show a good understanding of and respect for New Zealand&rsquo;s dual cultural heritage.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in four early childhood education services within the Auckland Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation. The Review Findings</p><p>The kindergarten is efficiently managed and operated. Teachers follow the Auckland Kindergarten Association vision statement in their philosophy for their kindergarten. Management and policy frameworks are supplied by the Association and teachers add additional policies that relate to their teaching and management. Shared professional development has helped to add critical understanding to the writing and implementation of some policies.</p><p>Teachers&rsquo; strategic plan for the centre is an elaboration of the Association mission statement. Teachers have made a determined effort to make their vision and planning more child-centred and inclusive.</p><p>Personnel from Auckland Kindergarten Association provide effective support for teachers to build and develop their teaching practice. Teachers share a culture of professional curiosity that encourages their accessing of professional learning.</p><p>Teachers foster a respectful and nurturing environment in which children develop a sense of belonging and wellbeing. Teachers&rsquo; shared responsibility for the programme and areas of play ensures a wide range of activities and experiences for children. Children are able to make choices about their play, and enjoy conversations and discussions with their peers and teachers. Teachers provide effective support for children to learn about literacy, science and numeracy, often in the context of play.</p><p>Teachers&rsquo; relationships with children&rsquo;s families are welcoming and friendly. Teachers know children well and are able to use information about children&rsquo;s home lives to plan responsive programmes. Most teachers bring additional experience in working with children with diverse needs to their teaching. Children with diverse needs are carefully integrated into centre activities and children are welcoming and accepting of each other. Teachers are developing useful processes to support children&rsquo;s transition to school.</p><p>Teachers and ERO agree on next steps for the kindergarten&rsquo;s further development. These include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to prioritise assessment and planning as an area for review and development, including children&rsquo;s involvement in planning</li>
<li>ensuring that professional development is targeted, purposeful and enacted in programmes</li>
<li>using self review to monitor and continue to develop teaching and learning strategies within the programme</li>
<li>developing an annual plan that reflects progress towards strategic goals.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Northbridge Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><p>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</p><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu'uga Stevenson</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>2 November 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
