</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>First Steps Te Atatu continues to provide good quality education and care in a home-like environment for children from three months to school age. <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, forms the foundation of this centre’s education and care.</p><p>Since ERO’s 2011 review, First Steps Te Atatu has combined the preschool and infants’ centre under one licence. While the two age groups are catered for in separate buildings, the teaching teams work well together to provide the children with continuity of care. Structural plans are being developed to combine the two buildings and provide a larger teaching and learning space.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of Kidicorp Ltd. Professional and administrative direction is provided by a Kidicorp professional services manager and a business manager. The organisation provides frameworks, policies, support and guidance to develop and monitor consistency of practice.</p><p>Over the past three years, there have been considerable staffing changes. The recent appointments of the head teacher for the under twos, and an acting centre manager, have been instrumental in building a team that works collaboratively and is committed to good quality educational and care outcomes for children.</p><p>The positive features of First Steps Te Atatu acknowledged in ERO’s 2011 report continue to be evident. The centre has responded well to ERO’s recommendations to further develop the teaching and learning programme for older children and to improve self review.</p><p>Ongoing professional learning and development over the past three years has included building a shared knowledge of self review, improving processes to support children’s transition to school, and further developing learning and programme planning. Professional learning has been in response to the needs of the whole staff and of individual teachers. The centre is also preparing to use communication technologies to increase information sharing with parents about their children’s learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre is welcoming to children and their parents and whānau. Teachers take the time to settle children and speak with their parents/caregivers as part of the settling process.</p><p>Responsive caregivers support infants’ and toddlers’ need for caring relationships. Children under the age of two benefit from one-to-one interactions with teachers. They are well nurtured through consistent, continuous care that reinforces their sense of security and belonging. The calm, unhurried tone enables infants and toddlers to communicate their preferences. Children’s transitions across the two age groups are well managed.</p><p>Children learn through play. They show enjoyment in each others’ company. Children are valued as capable and competent communicators and learners. Teachers genuinely listen to children and engage them in meaningful conversations to foster their language and early mathematical skills. Leaders are keen to extend the complexity of children’s mathematical knowledge and vocabulary. Teachers are becoming more consistent in using challenging and open-ended questioning strategies to engage children in learning and develop their problem-solving skills.</p><p>There is joint involvement in child and teacher-initiated activities. Leaders agree that they could consider further ways to extend opportunities for children to make sense of the natural, physical and material worlds. Teachers appropriately develop children’s awareness of, and respect for, each other and their environment.</p><p>Teachers are growing in their understanding of each child as a unique learner. They have reviewed their assessment and planning practices to focus more clearly on, and respond to, the learning dispositions of each child. Children’s portfolios show the increasing complexity of children’s learning.</p><p>Teachers are becoming more confident in using te reo Māori. Leaders have identified the need to work collaboratively and responsively with Māori parents and whānau to support their aspirations for their children. They acknowledge that they also need to evaluate the extent to which assessment practices value and respond to Pacific cultures, knowledge and ways of learning.</p><p>The centre is well managed and well led. Leadership is based on respect and trust. Teacher input into decision making is valued. Leader and teacher capacity in self review is continually being developed. There is a clear focus on continual improvement. The centre philosophy is used well to guide and evaluate the quality of care and education provided for children. Teachers’ performance appraisal is well managed. Leaders are currently looking for further ways to use the Registered Teacher Criteria in ways specific to this centre and learning context.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO affirms the centre’s self-identified next steps for ongoing improvement. These are to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop bicultural practices and build te ao Māori perspectives across the curriculum</li>
<li>improve self review and evaluate the impact of changes over time</li>
<li>continue to develop a learning partnership that includes parents in the development of the centre philosophy, vision, goals, and teaching and learning programme.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of First Steps Te Atatu completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of First Steps Te Atatu will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>3 December 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
