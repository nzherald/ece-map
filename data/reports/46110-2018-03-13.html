</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Country Kids Pre-School is located in Pyes Pa, Tauranga and is a privately owned centre. It's licensed for 56 children, including 10 children aged under two years. At the time of the review the roll of 84 includes 2 Māori and a small number of children from diverse ethnic backgrounds. It provides all-day education and care from 7.30am to 5pm Monday to Friday. There are three age-based areas for infants, toddlers and preschool children.</p><p>Country Kids aims to provide high-quality care and education in a safe, stimulating, homely environment in an interactive farmyard setting.</p><p>The centre philosophy is based on the belief that every child is special and unique, and they are committed to building reciprocal relationships with every child and their whᾱnau. In addition, Christian beliefs and values are respected and celebrated. The importance of the Treaty of Waitangi is acknowledged across the service.</p><p>Since the 2015 ERO report the centre has restructured the leadership team, reviewed their philosophy and continued to improve performance management systems.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre curriculum is highly responsive to the strengths and interests of all children. Curriculum design and implementation is underpinned by <em>Te Whariki</em> and is consistent with the centre’s Christian philosophy. A feature of the programme is the opportunity to explore a farming environment and care for a range of animals. The centre curriculum is planned to allow children to play independently and develop social skills with their peers. The outdoor environment provides opportunities for children to take risks and challenge their physical capabilities. Literacy and mathematics are well integrated within the daily programme. Children are happily engaged in play and learning.</p><p>ERO observed high-quality teaching practices. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>positive, sensitive relationships with children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>taking time to listen to children and extend their learning and ideas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>talking to children about decisions that affect them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>actively promoting peer interactions.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are attuned to the needs and personalities of infants. Interactions with young children are unhurried, nurturing and focused on empowering children’s sense of belonging and communication. The centre programme and teacher interactions with children include waiata, karakia, local legends and the use of te reo Māori as a functional language. The sense of belonging for children and whānau is nurtured during transitions into and within the service, and when moving to school.</p><p>Leaders have established a focus on building teachers' capability. Teachers have undertaken professional development to enhance their practice. They are enthusiastic about further learning. The recently implemented approach to shared leadership has successfully promoted collaboration and built leadership capability across the teaching team. Leaders base relationships on respect, trust and open communication. The distributive leadership approach is contributing to increasingly positive outcomes for children and families.</p><p>Recent review of the centre philosophy has affirmed the strategic direction and further embedded the centre's vision and goals. The service demonstrates a strong commitment to consulting with whānau and involving them in decision making about their child’s education and care. They provide effective policies and systems that promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified the following areas for ongoing development:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Leaders need to develop a more planned approach to self review. This includes shared understandings, and processes to support spontaneous and planned self-review across the service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There continues to be a need for centre management to strengthen appraisal processes to include key components of best practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Country Kids Pre-School Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance:</p><p>The service provider must ensure that furniture or equipment that could topple and cause injury or damage is secured. <em>[Licensing criteria for Education and care centres 2008, HS6]</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Country Kids Pre-School Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>13 March 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
