</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edukids Queen St early childhood education and care centre is situated in Hastings and is part of the Kidicorp group. In November 2013 the centre increased its licence from 50 to 60 children.</p><p>Centre staff are well supported by a Kidicorp management team. Significant staff changes, especially in the infant and toddlers room have occurred since the May 2011 ERO report. A new centre manager has provided support and guidance for a newly established group of teachers. Management and teachers have responded positively to the areas for development and review in ERO’s previous report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre’s philosophy is highly evident in the programme. Children benefit from positive relationships with their peers and adults, supporting children’s sense of belonging. The centre has a calm atmosphere. As a result, the children settle quickly and play happily with each other.</p><p>Children and their parents and whānau are made to feel welcome at the centre. Positive relationships are fostered with families. Teachers regularly ask parents and whānau to share the aspirations they have for their children while they attend the centre. This helps them develop a curriculum that caters for the specific needs and interests of each child, and for groups of children.</p><p>Children demonstrate confidence and competence in the programme. Their independence is fostered through flexible routines. Responsive caregiving supports infants' and toddlers' need for strong and secure attachments. Learning conversations provide opportunities for children to explore and extend their learning. Profile books are a good record that shows children’s identities as successful learners. They reflect the development of children’s knowledge and skills with people, places and things.</p><p>Teachers work in partnership with appropriate external agencies and parents of children with special needs to improve and enhance their learning.</p><p>Teachers reviewed planning processes so that there is better alignment between children’s observed interests, planning and evaluation. Managers have identified this as an ongoing focus as they become more familiar with the principles of <em>Ka Hikitia: Accelerating Success 2013-2017</em> and <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em>. Staff continue to focus on promoting each child’s language, culture and identity in the curriculum, especially for Māori and Pacific children. ERO affirms this as an area of ongoing development.</p><p>Transitions within the centre and to school are sensitively managed based on each child’s needs and parents' preferences and aspirations. Children are presented with a ‘Be School Ready’ certificate which focuses on identifying the key attributes that supports their movement to school.</p><p>Māori children succeeding as Māori is highly valued. Connections with whānau and iwi are helping teachers develop an understanding and inclusion of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori in their practices and the centre curriculum.</p><p>Teachers are planning to increase the participation of Pacific families in the curriculum.</p><p>Teachers are well supported to grow their professional practices through an appropriately structured and administered appraisal process. Professional learning and development is based on individual, centre and regional goals. Provisionally registered teachers have a useful needs-based professional guidance programme. Ongoing review of these processes should ensure they meet the needs of all teachers and are improvement focused.</p><p>The recently appointed centre manager brings a strong focus on fostering team collaboration. A detailed action plan identifies education and care priorities that should contribute to improving outcomes for children, their families and whānau and teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>Centre managers agree that self review is developing. In particular, they are building a shared understanding of using a planned approach to evidence based self review. ERO agrees with this key next step.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edukids Queen St completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edukids Queen St will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><p>13 March 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
