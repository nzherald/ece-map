</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>PORSE Mana S1 is a home-based education and care network operating under the umbrella of PORSE In-Home Childcare. Qualified and registered programme tutors work alongside educators to implement and support learning programmes for children in homes. PORSE also supports families and educators with professional development, administration and payroll services. A national team provides governance and management support for all PORSE services.</p><p>PORSE offers two models of education and care: the Home Educator model, where an educator works in their own home; and a Nanny Educator model, where an educator works in a family’s home. PORSE provides a range of training programmes and workshops for home educators, nannies and parents. There are 64 children enrolled in this network and 12 identify as Māori.</p><p>The PORSE vision is ‘expanding the hearts, minds and wellbeing of a nation through nurturing childcare in-home’.</p><p>This review is one of a cluster of five home-based network reviews of PORSE In-Home Childcare. This network was previously known as PORSE Mana/Kapiti S2.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in an individualised programme that is responsive to their interests. Educators support these interests by providing a range of activities. The programme is extended through outings into the local community and attendance at PlaySchool. The PlaySchool experience is part of the child’s overall learning programme. These experiences have recently been strengthened through focused planning and regular reflection.</p><p>Programme tutors affirm and support educators’ practice. A range of professional development opportunities, facilitated by PORSE, are available. Many are responsive to educators’ interests. Educators are kept well informed of these. Programme tutors should embed educators’ new learning further through home visits.</p><p>A greater emphasis by programme tutors on supporting educators to further develop their understanding of assessment, planning and evaluation is necessary. Programme tutors regularly visit children in the home. They observe children and discuss their interests and ongoing development and report this to parents. During home visits, programme tutors provide some direction to educators about supporting children’s interests. However, there is limited documentation which shows how educators are supported and coached in the use of assessment, planning and evaluation. PORSE agrees this is a next step and has planned professional learning in assessment, planning and evaluation for their programme tutors in 2015.</p><p>There is a commitment to the ongoing development of a bicultural curriculum within a home-based context. PORSE is developing plans to strengthen the participation of Māori families in the organisation. Leaders acknowledge that this is an area of continual development. Ongoing planning should include strategies for promoting success for Māori as Māori.</p><p>Managers are improvement focused and there are useful systems and processes to track operational expectations. PORSE is currently reviewing many of these approaches and aligning them to current practice. A next step is to strengthen the monitoring of systems and processes, including those related to health and safety.</p><p>PORSE administrative systems effectively support educators, programme tutors and coaches in their roles. PORSE has recently formalised its approach to the privacy of information about children in early childhood education by developing a privacy policy. Planned professional development should strengthen staff understanding of their responsibility.</p><p>Leaders acknowledge that the appraisal process needs further development. ERO agrees with this direction and identifies that strengthening the focus on teaching and learning and the consistent implementation of a robust appraisal processes are key next steps.</p><p>PORSE managers recognise that self review at all levels of the organisation requires strengthening. Leaders should support programme tutors to understand the purpose and use of self review to improve outcomes for children in their context. Use of a more evaluative and systematic approach to self review that focuses on outcomes for children, should strengthen current practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities for this service are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation for children’s learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the bicultural approach within a home-based context, including the focus on success for Māori as Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self review as a tool to improve outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal through the consistent implementation of a robust process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the monitoring of systems and practices that track the operational expectations of PORSE.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of PORSE Mana S1 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During regular monthly home visits programme tutors monitor the health and safety of the environment to promote the safety of children. To improve practice PORSE should consider how they can use the assurance systems to effectively monitor that all health and safely expectations are met.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of PORSE Mana S1 will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>7 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
