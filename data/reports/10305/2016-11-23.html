</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres (11) in Henderson offers all day care and education for children. The licence allows for 95 children, including 40 up to two years of age.</p><p>The centre is managed in accordance with Kindercare policies and procedures that provide guidance for the operation of the service. Kindercare’s philosophy outlines the intentions of the service to provide an environment where children feel safe, loved and where learning is fun. Teachers are well supported by the organisation in the areas of administration, curriculum and leadership.</p><p>Children are grouped largely by age into five rooms within the purpose-built centre. Children and staff come from diverse ethnicities and cultural backgrounds. Staff are long serving. They work well together to cater for the children in their care.</p><p>The 2010 ERO report found the centre to be effectively managed. It identified the need to develop self review, to provide greater challenge for children and to develop their social competence. These areas for development have been the focus of professional learning and considerable progress is evident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging in their room. They benefit from settled environments and genuine attachments to teachers. Children form respectful relationships with each other and with their teachers. They are able to engage in activities uninterrupted and to seek help and support from adults.</p><p>Babies and toddlers’ preferences for care routines are acknowledged and valued. Infants are seen as capable and confident learners. Teachers take time to engage with children as individuals and to encourage them to direct their own learning.</p><p>Teachers value strong, supportive relationships with children’s families and whānau. They extend the care they offer to children to all involved in the wider centre community. As a result, teachers know and understand the children well. Centre leaders value these relationships and are interested to find other ways the wider community can be involved in the centre.</p><p>Parents are invited to share the aspirations they have for their children. Teachers report to parents about their children’s learning in relation to the strands of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers work together collaboratively to ensure children’s needs are met.</p><p>Centre leaders have trialled new learning journals to strengthen home and centre relationships. Through the journals, teachers share relevant information about children with parents on a daily basis. Teachers are planning to use these journals throughout the centre. ERO supports this initiative to further develop the partnership between parents and the centre.</p><p>Centre leaders work together professionally to provide effective leadership and management that values the whole centre community. They encourage teachers to engage in leadership opportunities aligned to their interests. This action supports the development and sustainability of good practices.</p><p>Centre leaders monitor and support teacher development. Teachers develop appropriate goals for appraisal. They reflect honestly about their progress and efforts to achieve their goals. Teachers access professional development that supports their own, and the centre’s priorities.</p><p>Teachers have focussed their professional conversations on developing social competence in the children. Children are supported to build their skills to be resilient and persistent. Teachers model strategies that build these dispositions. Children are now using these skills and becoming increasingly self managing. Social competence is valued as a prerequisite to formal education at school.</p><p>Self-review processes have been developed. Information from self review has been used by staff to help them to improve the centre’s environments and programmes. As self review becomes more embedded, centre leaders appropriately intend to include greater use of early childhood education research and theory in the process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have identified areas for further development, including:</p><ul>
<li>ensuring all children have greater opportunities to participate in a bicultural curriculum</li>
<li>increasing teacher responsiveness to children’s language, culture and identity</li>
<li>developing the emergent curriculum to build on and extend children’s individual interests</li>
<li>continuing to refine and develop self-review processes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres (11) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres (11) will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>15 November 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
