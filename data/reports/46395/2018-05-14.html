</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Butterfly Preschool is situated in Fitzroy, New Plymouth. In 2016 its licence was increased to 38, to include provision for eight children aged up to two years. At the time of this evaluation, eight Māori children were enrolled in the service.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are allocated key teachers, resources and indoor spaces separate to those of older children. The outdoor space is shared between the two age groups. Plans are in place for redevelopment of the outdoor environment.</p><p>The service philosophy outlines celebrating learning, friendship and independence, through respectful, treaty-based teaching in collaboration with whānau.</p><p>The service is privately owned and operated. The owner takes responsibility for management and governance. She is also the head teacher for the preschool section, working in close liaison with the infants and toddlers' head teacher. They collaborate on curriculum review and development. All teaching staff are qualified.</p><p>The service has been very responsive to areas for development identified in the June 2015 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children display high levels of confidence and independence. They freely access a wide range of stimulating resources, indoors and out. Activities and excursions are based on their interests.</p><p>Highly respectful teachers support and enrich children's play. Literacy and oral language development are well promoted. There are many opportunities for children to extend their creativity and critical thinking. Active movement is strongly encouraged. Children's social competence is monitored and sensitively supported, with an emphasis on kindness and respect.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well-served by knowledgeable, responsive teachers. Their growing confidence, communication and physical development are effectively promoted through skilful planning and warm interactions. These very young children are affirmed as competent learners, exploring the attractive environment and challenging, open-ended resources at their own pace. Teachers follow their lead.</p><p>All children benefit from the strong learning partnerships between teachers and families. Parents play an active role in strategic and curriculum decisions, through surveys, parent evenings, online contact and informal discussion. Parents' aspirations for their children’s learning are gathered and valued.</p><p>Children are very well supported to grow as learners. A recent large-scale review of the assessment, planning and evaluation cycle has resulted in significant improvements. Documentation now clearly demonstrates how children’s learning has been purposefully enhanced through specific, individualised teaching strategies. Planning for learning is based on close observation of children’s interests and dispositions, regular consultation with families, and a range of useful guiding documents. Plans are enacted, evaluated and extended.</p><p>Teachers are beginning to successfully gather and use cultural information to further enhance the learning success of Māori and Pacific learners. Culturally responsive support for tamariki and whānau Māori is particularly well implemented. ERO's evaluation confirms that teachers should continue with these well-considered strategies.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have demonstrated strong commitment to continually growing and monitoring the bicultural curriculum. Children are offered many valuable opportunities to experience elements of te ao Māori. Taranaki-specific learning in this area affirms children’s sense of place and belonging. Leaders agree that growing their use of te reo Māori in conversations with children is a next step.</p><p>Comprehensive processes are in place to support children’s smooth transitions into, through and out of the centre. Positive relationships with local schools are established. Strong connections between home and centre are purposefully developed to promote children’s belonging, confidence and resilience during transition times.</p><p>Children with diverse learning needs benefit from highly inclusive practices. Teachers build close, effective relationships with whānau and support agencies to inform tailored teaching.</p><p>The service philosophy, developed collaboratively by management, teachers and whānau, is underpinned by shared values and beliefs. It is highly evident in practice. The strategic plan effectively supports the enactment of the philosophy and is strongly linked to positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The teaching team collaborate on robust, systematic internal evaluations of their practice. Consultation with families and relevant research guide decisions. Skilful gathering and critique of high-quality data is a centre strength. As a result, improvements to centre practice are very well considered, ensuring positive outcomes for children and their families. The service is well equipped to self-identify and monitor developments.</p><p>Effective annual appraisals are in place. <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em> has been usefully incorporated into the process. Teachers' goals and professional learning opportunities are well aligned to the centre’s strategic direction and philosophy. Mentoring and regular feedback and feedforward appropriately challenge teachers to improve their practice.</p><p>Respectful leaders successfully promote a collaborative team culture. Teachers are motivated, and committed to delivering a high-quality service for children and families.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has confidence in the service's capacity to self-identify next steps and monitor ongoing improvements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Butterfly Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Butterfly Preschool will be in four years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>14 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
