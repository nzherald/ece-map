</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Learning Corner Early Learning Centre (previously known as Little Scholars) in Mt Albert, Auckland, provides good education and care for children from three months to five years of age. Children aged from three to five years are catered for in a renovated house with spacious indoor and outdoor areas. Babies and toddlers have access to a shared outdoor space. The centre philosophy promotes family values and connections. Staff reflect the cultural diversity of the children who attend. The centre is welcoming and inclusive of children with special educational needs.</p><p>In October 2013, the centre changed ownership and a new centre manager started in January 2014. Most staff have remained at the centre and some have worked there for many years. Most of the teachers are well qualified and are registered. An experienced cook continues to provide children with nutritious vegetarian meals.</p><p>Since the start of 2014 the centre has been painted, and managers have plans for upgrading the outdoor play spaces. Teachers have participated in professional learning to gain a greater understanding of the Treaty of Waitangi and to improve bicultural practices. Managers and staff have responded well to the next steps identified in the 2011 ERO report, with a particular focus on developing centre-wide approaches to planning, assessing and evaluating children’s learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience warm and nurturing relationships with their teachers and staff. They are treated with respect and kindness and are supported to participate in learning activities. Teachers engage children in regular conversation. They ask children good questions, and wait patiently for children to respond. This respectful approach gives children time to think, helps them develop oral language skills, and supports their wellbeing.</p><p>Some teachers are able to communicate and support children and parents in their home languages, especially Chinese, Indian, Filipino and Tongan. Teachers are committed to promoting a bicultural curriculum and are increasingly integrating te reo Māori into the programme. Managers intend to incorporate the Ministry of Education’s strategies, <em>Ka Hikitia - Accelerating Success 2013-2017</em>, and the <em>Pasifika Education Plan 2013-2017</em>, into the centre’s strategic plan to further promote success for Māori and Pacific learners.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively to plan, assess and evaluate learning programmes for children. They identify priorities for children’s individual learning and plan learning opportunities for small and larger groups. Teachers encourage children to participate in activities prepared for them, including opportunities for literacy and mathematics learning. Teachers now need to make the teaching and learning of literacy skills and mathematics concepts more explicit in planning and assessment documents.</p><p>Babies and toddlers especially benefit from ongoing relationships with the same experienced teachers. Teachers are calm, patient, and affectionate with children. They ensure that children’s care needs are met. Activities for the younger children are appropriate for their ages.</p><p>Older children are most engaged in learning when they are able to choose and explore activities and the centre environment independently. The manager is interested in reviewing and improving the purpose and usefulness of group and mat times for these older children so that the time they spend following teacher direction, waiting, and sitting still is minimised.</p><p>Teachers carefully support children to transition to the different areas when they are old enough or ready to move. The manager is making useful connections with local schools. She identifies the need to further review and improve the school-readiness programme for older children so that it better reflects current early childhood education theories.</p><p>The manager, an experienced early childhood educator, is improvement-focused. She is working to build a centre-wide team culture, and to promote opportunities for teacher leadership. The owner, manager and teachers have collaborated to create a well considered vision statement, centre philosophy and strategic goals. The owner understands his governance role clearly, provides good support for the manager, and promotes ethically-sound business principles.</p><p>The manager and owner have a good understanding of self review and of external review as key mechanisms for improvement. They value opportunities to connect with children’s families and the wider community to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner, manager and ERO agree that the key next steps for The Learning Corner Early Learning Centre would be best supported by accessing an external early childhood specialist to work with the manager and teachers. This specialist could provide an appropriately challenging appraisal process for the manager and support the development of a useful teacher performance appraisal process. The owner and manager recognise that aligning <em>Tātaiako - Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em> to appraisals would further support staff as they develop their bicultural practice.</p><p>The external specialist could also provide strategically aligned professional learning for teachers to further:</p><ul>
<li>develop learning programmes, especially for older children, that are based on children’s emerging interests, extend their thinking and promote high levels of challenge</li>
<li>review and improve the indoor environments for babies and toddlers</li>
<li>promote opportunities for teacher inquiry, based on areas of interest and aligned to the centre’s strategic direction.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Learning Corner Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Learning Corner Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>14 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
