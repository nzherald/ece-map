</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>PAUA (Preschoolers at-Home Uniquely Achieving), provides home-based education and care for young children within communities throughout New Zealand. The director has oversight of all PAUA operations. She is supported by a team directly responsible for teaching and learning. The education team leader oversees visiting teachers who support educators to provide education and care for children. Peer leaders mentor visiting teachers in their work. All PAUA staff regularly monitor health and safety practices in educators' homes.</p><p>A significant number of children and educators are Māori or Pacific. Many children are cared for by whānau and family members. The visiting teachers and educators know their communities well. They are strongly focused on children having equitable opportunities to become confident, capable learners.</p><p>The network is licensed for a maximum of 80 children, including 40 up to two years old. The roll at the time of this review is 31, and 23 children are Māori. Two visiting teachers work in the network located in Auckland.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five home-based education and care service reviews in the PAUA organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The visiting teachers model good early childhood practices to support educators', families' and children's learning. They acknowledge further work is needed to develop strategies that support educators' understanding about children's learning and their teaching role.</p><p>Children's cultures, languages and identities are promoted in meaningful learning contexts. Māori children are well supported to succeed educationally as Māori. Educators are confident speakers of te reo Māori. With the guidance of their visiting teachers they effectively support children's engagement and participation in learning that acknowledges te ao Māori.</p><p>The curriculum is meaningful and children have fun. Information shows that children engage in a curriculum that is based on their observed interests. Educators are well supported by the visiting teacher to provide a wide range of learning experiences. Suitable resources provided by educators and PAUA promote infants', toddlers' and young children's engagement in activities. A commitment to inclusive practices is evident. Children with diverse needs are well catered for.</p><p>Children's learning is clearly depicted in assessment documents. The visiting teachers effectively support educators to record children's learning and share this with families and whānau. Photographs, identification of links to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and various forms of research are used to guide educators in their understanding. Parents and whānau access children's assessment information electronically. Their comments are used to enhance their child's experiences at the educator's home.</p><p>The visiting teachers support and encourage educators to use assessment practices that identify children's learning, next steps and progress. Continuing to strengthen this practice is an ongoing focus for the visiting teachers.</p><p>Most children have a range of opportunities to mix with other children while in their educator's care. The visiting teachers have developed a wide range of community networks. They encourage educators to access these to enhance children's experiences outside the home. The visiting teachers plan playgroups based on children's interests.</p><p>PAUA has well developed processes to monitor that its expectations for provision of quality education and care are being met. Visiting teachers develop monthly records of significant events for children and individual educators. Weekly reflections inform visiting teachers' own development and these are recorded against the Practising Teacher Criteria. Through PAUA systems, the director is assured that staff take all reasonable steps to implement practices that promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>As an organisation, PAUA management has identified that strategic planning, review and internal evaluation and supporting educators to develop an understanding of their role in promoting children's learning are areas that require strengthening. ERO's external evaluation supports this direction.</p><p>The development of an appraisal policy and procedures should assist visiting teachers to reflect on their current practice and plan future development. Leaders should formalise and strengthen teacher appraisal.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of PAUA Poppetts 2 completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of PAUA Poppetts 2 will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>21 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
