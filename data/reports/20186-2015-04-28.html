</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Creative Kids is a well established and privately owned centre situated in Beach Haven on Auckland’s North Shore. It provides care and education for up to 40 children under five years of age.</p><p>The owner and head teacher share supervision and leadership of the learning environments. While all teachers have some leadership roles within each of the rooms, the owner and head teacher oversee the management of programmes. The majority of teachers, including the owner, are qualified and registered.</p><p>Babies and toddlers are catered for in an upstairs section of the centre with an adjoining outdoor play area. Older children use the ground floor. Part day and full day attendance options are offered to families. The centre has policies and systems to assist the smooth running of the centre.</p><p>The April 2012 ERO report identified children as being confident and articulate learners. Teachers were responsive to children. Older children’s learning was extended through group work. Planning for babies and toddlers was individualised. Collaboration and collective decision-making was valued and promoted.</p><p>The ERO report also identified that children’s interests and opportunities to lead their own learning could be further extended. It was suggested that more resources be provided to stimulate and sustain children’s interest. More inclusion of te reo Māori was encouraged.</p><p>This 2015 report ERO report affirms the centre’s on-going development of good practices and recommends that managers and staff continue to focus on providing support to extend children’s learning based on their individual interests.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre provides good quality education and care. Children are settled, articulate and confident. They are socially aware of others and enjoy interacting with their peers and adults. Children get good support for and encouragement for language development. The centre programme is relaxed and inclusive. Children with special learning needs, including gifted children, are sensitively supported.</p><p>Babies and toddlers are well cared for and nurtured. Their separate learning environment provides them with opportunities to have programmes that specifically meet their developmental needs. The Pikler/RIE concepts of children growing at their own pace and mastering aspects of their own development independently, help teachers guide the progress of babies and toddlers. Teachers are currently reviewing the effectiveness of documented learning programmes for these children.</p><p>All children have ready access to an outdoor learning environment. The outdoor area for older children is particularly spacious and features conservation and natural learning experiences.</p><p>Creative Kids’ philosophy is child-centred. Partnerships with whānau are seen as an important key to helping children meet their full potential in all aspects of their development. Respectful, trusting relationships and valuing children’s individuality in a nurturing environment is fundamental.</p><p>Children are predominantly NZ European/Pākehā. A small number of children from other ethnicities, including Māori, Samoan, Indian, and other Asian groups also attend. Through self review teachers have begun implementing a bicultural approach to centre practices. Their goal is to fully acknowledge tangata whenua as the indigenous people of Aotearoa and to further support Māori children to succeed in their learning journey. Teachers have also identified the need to continue to improve practices that acknowledge and support the heritage of children of all ethnicities that attend the centre.</p><p>Centre managers continue to make good progress. The owner is developing a collaborative leadership and management style of operation that incorporates the expertise of the staff. Centre managers have developed comprehensive and effective self-review systems that allow staff to focus on making meaningful improvements to administration, support systems and centre practices. Leaders are currently working towards developing a consistency between strategic planning, staff appraisal and professional learning development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers agree that managers and staff should continue to use self review findings to guide improvements and to:</p><ul>
<li>ensure the centre’s philosophy reflects its commitment to high quality education for children</li>
<li>revisit the implementation of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, in centre practices and planning</li>
<li>continue to support children to develop strategies to lead and extend their own knowledge and learning</li>
<li>provide more written evidence of parent input into planning for children’s learning.</li>
</ul><p>The centre manager also identifies that it would be helpful for the centre to access external professional advice and support to implement these next steps.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Creative Kids completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practices the manager should:</p><ul>
<li>include lockdown processes in crisis management procedures</li>
<li>develop a written procedure for earthquake drills</li>
<li>ensure that the police vetting procedures for unqualified and non-teaching staff are followed consistently within expected time frames.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Creative Kids will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>28 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
