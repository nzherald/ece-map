</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wakatipu Playcentre is one of 47 playcentres within the New Zealand Playcentre Federation's newly-formed South Island Southern Region (SISR). It is open five mornings a week. Up to 25 children from birth to school age attend with their parents. The families come from the Queenstown district. The families are from diverse cultural backgrounds and change often due to the seasonal nature of work in the area. Most children attend one or two sessions a week. Many of these children are aged three years and under.</p><p>In early 2017, the service was assisted by the Ministry of Education to relocate to a refurbished building on a new site. The sessions are coordinated by a paid educator. There are increasing numbers of parents participating in the Playcentre Adult Education Programme.</p><p>In 2017, the playcentre was supported by a centre advisor with occasional visits and frequent communications from the Playcentre Association. In 2018, as a result of the Playcentre Federation restructuring of the association, the playcentre now has regular visits and receives ongoing support from a Centre Support Worker (CSW)</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine reviews in the South Island Southern Region (SISR) Playcentres.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Parents at Wakatipu Playcentre have clear ideas about what learning is important for their children. The recently redeveloped philosophy statement includes aspirations for children to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>belong to a multi-cultural community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appreciate diversity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be responsible guardians of the natural environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>know they and their family learn together in positive ways.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These aspirations are evident in the programme. Over time the playcentre needs to evaluate how well the philosophy continues to be enacted and how well children are supported in their learning.</p><p>The playcentre offers a child-led programme where children freely choose their activities in well-resourced and interesting play areas. They are well supported by the educator and their own and other parents as they play and learn. Young babies and toddlers attend with their parents. The educator ensures that the programme is tailored to the needs and interests of these age groups.</p><p>A growing strength in the playcentre is the evident commitment to and growing inclusion of Māori perspectives in the programme and practices. The parents have sought external expertise to know the cultural history for their area. They are creating an environment where all children, and in particular Māori children, can learn about and be proud of New Zealand's bicultural heritage.</p><p>The educator, with the guidance of the CSW, has developed useful processes for planning and assessment for individual and groups of children. These processes are in the early stages of being implemented. The next step is to consolidate and embed these processes and encourage all parents to take an active part in planning and implementing the programme with the educator.</p><p>The parents have established a strong sense of belonging to the playcentre for the whole family. They have shown commitment and dedication through the relocation of the playcentre to the new site. They work well together as a parent collective. There is a culture of ongoing improvement and reflection. The next step for the parents is to work with the CSW to find ways to make internal-evaluation practices meaningful and manageable for their context.</p><p>At the time of this review, the OPA was implementing the New Zealand Playcentre Federation's new operating model, and was amalgamating with Southland and South Canterbury Playcentre Associations to become the South Island Southern Region. While the changes resulted in some disruption to the services provided to individual playcentres in 2017, the OPA is effectively managing the restructure with the resources available to them. Each playcentre now receives regular support from a paid administrator and a centre support worker. There are robust systems in the association for monitoring the progress and performance of individual playcentres, and targeted support is given when needed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for educator and parents with the support of the CSW are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure that the aspirations and priorities for learning are evaluated over time so they can be assured that all children are well supported in their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embed the planning and assessment processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a shared understanding of effective internal evaluation and use internal evaluation as a means to know how well the playcentre is providing for children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wakatipu Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Wakatipu Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>8 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
