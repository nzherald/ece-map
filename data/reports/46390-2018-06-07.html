<p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>An-Nur Childcare Centre Dunedin is a Muslim-based centre in Dunedin. It provides all-day education and care for Muslim and non-Muslim children from birth-to-school age. Children from many ethnic backgrounds attend the centre. Most parents and children do not speak English as their first language. The centre's roll has doubled since its last Education Review in 2015.</p>
<p>The centre's priorities for children are for them to be confident Muslims, active explorers, keen inquirers and creative intellectuals. Fostering Arabic and English language learning is an ongoing curriculum focus.</p>
<p>The centre is governed by the Al Noor Charitable Trust, which also governs a sister centre in Christchurch. Both centres have a manager who spends significant time between the two. Teachers at An-Nur are mostly Muslim, with some speaking Arabic fluently. Leadership responsibilities are shared within the centre. The trust assists some children with transportation to and from the centre.</p>
<p>In the last year the centre has moved into a building that has been relocated and refurbished as a childcare centre. Children learn and are cared for in two rooms with infants and toddlers in one room and older children in the other. Children from the two rooms mix at different times during the day. The centre has been fully relicensed by the Ministry of Education. It is currently located next to an English Language Learning School.</p>
<p>This centre has sustained and built on the areas of good practice that were identified in the 2015 ERO report. All areas identified for improvement or development have been successfully addressed.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Relationships between staff, parents and wider families are strong, supportive and respectful. Parents and children are very warmly greeted and supported by teachers. The centre provides a safe and secure environment.</p>
<p>The teaching programme provides many daily opportunities for children to learn about the Muslim faith. All children have Islamic learning as one of their learning goals. Oral language is used extensively to engage children and extend their learning. Children benefit from centre experiences which:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide them with early literacy and mathematics learning</li>
<li>teach them about the world and community around them</li>
<li>stimulate them to investigate and problem solve</li>
<li>focus on growing, tending, harvesting, preparing and eating food grown in the centre's garden</li>
<li>link centre learning with excursions beyond the centre.</li>
</ul>
<p>Children's individual and group learning is well planned for. This is reliably informed by teachers' observations and parents' aspirations for their children. Learning stories are shared with parents, with good use being made of information technology for this.</p>
<p>The children's curriculum has a strong focus on supporting their culture, identity and language development and growth in the Muslim faith. Arabic and English languages are modelled and used naturally within the daily programme. Children learn songs, the Quran, and about special events in the Muslim calendar. Children have language and other individual learning goals.</p>
<p>Children who are transitioning to school are well supported. The centre manager and teachers have developed useful links with neighbouring schools. As children approach school age, their readiness for school is fostered by visits to the chosen schools.</p>
<p>Warm, caring relationships nurture children under two. A space has been developed for them to be included in the daily programme, but safe from other active children.</p>
<p>There is a shared approach to leadership within the centre. Good use is being made of leaders' skills in leading teaching and learning, internal evaluation, and building teachers' knowledge of Te Whāriki (2017), the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum, and appraisal. Shared leadership is giving teachers a greater sense of ownership of what happens for children and ensures their strengths are well used.</p>
<p>The centre's philosophy has been recently reviewed, children's English language development has been supported in a range of ways, reporting and monitoring systems have been formalised and the appraisal system has a stronger focus on growing teaching practice.</p>
<p>The centre manager provides effective leadership. She has high expectations and is improvement focused. She fosters close links with the wider community to benefit children's learning.</p>
<p>The board of trustees has a relevant strategic plan. Progress towards meeting goals within this are monitored. This could be more deliberately reported in the head teacher's monthly reports to the board.</p>
<p>Teachers' professional development and learning is prioritised by the board. New learning contributes to internal evaluation. The board and centre manager actively develop partnerships with families and provide tangible support and assistance to migrant families. Parents and teachers collectively support new families to integrate into New Zealand society.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>To further strengthen centre practices the manager, leaders and teachers should:</p>
<ul>
<li>show in planning for individuals how they will extend the learning</li>
<li>ensure greater coherence between the centre's strategic goals, reporting and leaders' appraisal goals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of An-Nur Childcare Centre Dunedin will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p>
<h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul>
<p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
