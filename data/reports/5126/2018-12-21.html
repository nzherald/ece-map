</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Papakura West Kindergarten is a well-established service in a culturally and economically diverse community. It is licensed for 40 children over two years of age and follows the kindergarten day model (KDM), operating from 8.45 am to 2.45 pm.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association (CMKA) and operates under its policies and management framework. A CMKA education manager (EM) visits the kindergarten and provides leadership and curriculum support for teachers. The CMKA is in the process of reviewing its structures and operational framework.</p><p>The kindergarten's philosophy reflects the 'Enviro-schools' kaupapa. It promotes bicultural practices and a commitment to te ao Māori. The teaching team includes a head teacher, three other registered teachers, an administrator, and a teacher aide.</p><p>The kindergarten has a history of positive ERO reports. In 2015, ERO identified teachers' commitment to meaningful bicultural practices, effective support for children's learning, and integrated values. These continue to be present. Areas for ongoing improvement included planning, assessment and evaluation. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews in the CMKA.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well supported to be confident learners. Relationships at the kindergarten are relaxed and respectful. Teachers foster trust and connection among children, teachers, parents and whānau. Parents who spoke with ERO reported high levels satisfaction with their children's care and learning at the kindergarten.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are reflective about their practice, they intentionally provide a rich curriculum for all children. Teachers:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>use deliberate teaching approaches to extend children's knowledge and understanding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>purposefully embed the enviro schools' kaupapa in their teaching and in children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>skilfully use internal evaluation to improve teaching practices and outcomes for children and families</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>respond sensitively appropriately to the diverse needs of their community.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers plan for children's learning in response to their interests, family aspirations and the kindergarten's priorities. Children have access to a wide variety of experiences and resources. Teachers thoughtfully present indoor and outdoor learning environments.</p><p>Wall displays reflect children's learning and the teaching philosophy and approaches. Teachers integrate literacy and numeracy through meaningful learning opportunities for children. Teachers carefully learn and use aspects of children's home languages.</p><p>Some assessment documents show how children are describing their learning and thinking. Children revisit their learning through accessible portfolios and opportunities to continue with projects over a period of time.</p><p>CMKA strategic goals and the kindergarten's annual planning guide improvements in teaching practice, learning environments and outcomes for children and their whānau. Leaders and teachers strongly promote and implement the vision and direction of CMKA.</p><p>A culture of ongoing improvement is well embedded through collaborative and inclusive internal evaluation. Teachers use effective inquiry strategies and indicators to improve teaching practices. Teacher appraisals and professional discussions about theory and practice have also helped to create a community of learners.</p><p>Leaders have a clear vision to build individual teacher capability. Professional learning and development is relevant and has a positive impact on improving teaching practice and outcomes for children.</p><p>Well established CMKA management systems, policies and processes guide the kindergarten's practices. Embedding the practice of regular documented observations into CMKA appraisal processes would enhance the support provided for teachers' professional growth.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers agree that their key next steps include continuing to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>acknowledgement of children's cultures and languages in portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation and planning, through focusing on the effectiveness of teaching practices and outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>CMKA leaders agree that their next steps are to continue:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>providing consistent ongoing support for leaders and teachers that sustains leadership and improves teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the revised early childhood curriculum, to identify priorities for learning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting teachers to increase the visibility of children's cultural identity and continuity of learning in their individual portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building capability and depth in internal evaluation across the association.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Papakura West Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Papakura West Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>21 December 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
