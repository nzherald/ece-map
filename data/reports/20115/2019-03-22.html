</table><p align="center" style="text-align: left;">Tui's Nest Childcare Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tui’s Nest Childcare Centre is a well-established centre in Northcote, Auckland. It is licensed for 45 children, including up to 20 aged under two years. The centre offers full-day education and care in a mixed-age group programme. Children come from diverse cultural backgrounds, with most being Pākehā or Asian.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is aligned to the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. It emphasises building trusting relationships with children and whānau in a welcoming, respectful environment.</p><p>Since ERO’s 2015 report, a new centre manager has been appointed. A representative from an early education management group supports the manager. They lead a team of other teachers, and support staff.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report noted areas of good practice that continue to be present. Suggested improvements included internal evaluation, linking planning, evaluation and assessment, and extending children's thinking. The report also noted that further opportunities incorporating te ao Māori would enhance the curriculum. There has been good progress in some of these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s wellbeing is nurtured through positive, respectful relationships and strong connections with teachers and peers. Their care and needs are well supported. Children are warmly welcomed by staff on arrival. The centre's calm tone helps children settle quickly into the programme.</p><p>Children are supported to be confident learners. Their independence is fostered during free play. Children have many opportunities to explore the well-resourced, carefully considered environment. They play cooperatively with and alongside their peers, for sustained periods of time, and benefit from playing in mixed-age groups where they may interact with siblings.</p><p>Infants and toddlers receive nurturing and respectful care with shared primary caregiving. Teachers' sensitive and careful interactions result in a calm, settled environment. Children's individual needs and communication styles are well catered for. Infants' early language attempts are supported well by teachers.</p><p>Teachers model te reo and tikanga Māori. Children are encouraged to support each other in tuakana/teina relationships, particularly with the children under two years. Teachers and leaders have an ongoing commitment to developing bicultural practices.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively. They provide a learning programme that is inclusive and child-centred. Children confidently approach teachers, and trust they will respond positively to questions and ideas. Teachers skilfully support children to develop social competencies and collaboration. They know children well. Teachers foster children's oral language development and confidence in communicating with other children.</p><p>Teachers maintain individual portfolios for each child. These assessment records keep parents informed about their children’s learning journey and events in the centre.</p><p>The leadership team works collaboratively to provide quality outcomes for children. The philosophy and vision have been developed to guide the centre's direction. This is underpinned by a sound policy and procedure framework, which is continually refined and developed. The centre has an appropriate goal to develop a strategic plan for the next three years. Annual planning, internal evaluation and appraisal goals can then be aligned with the strategic plan to achieve coherence across systems.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>planning and evaluating programmes and strategies to extend children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the philosophy to align with teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a strategic plan to guide the centre's future development.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tui's Nest Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified non-compliance in relation to curriculum. To address this, the manager and teachers must plan, implement and evaluate learning programmes based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. <em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres, 2008, 1a (i,iv,v,vi).</em></p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>22 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
