</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kumeu Montessori Preschool is licensed to provide full day education and care for up to 50 children aged over two years. Children are cared for in two separate indoor spaces. They share a covered deck and outdoor play space. The Muriwai room caters for children aged two to three and a half years, and the Piha room caters for those aged three and a half to six years.</p><p>The service is privately owned and moved to its current location in 2015. The owners of the centre, one of whom is a qualified teacher, have active roles in teaching and centre management. They lead a team of four other qualified teachers and three teachers in training. The team is reflective of the cultural diversity of enrolled families.</p><p>The philosophy of the service is strongly underpinned by the development of positive and sensitive relationships with children and their whānau. The curriculum is based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, integrated with the principles of the Montessori Method. Teachers believe in planning for each child's individual needs and are committed to continuing their own professional learning and development.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified effective programme planning processes, a collaborative teaching team and the caring and responsive relationships between teachers, children and whānau. These aspects of quality care continue to be very evident in practice. Areas identified for ongoing development were the strengthening of emergent planning, bicultural practice and teachers' appraisals. There has been a very positive response in all three areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service's philosophy is very evident in practice. Children are confident, capable and self-motivated. Learning experiences provided by teachers offer opportunities for children to take appropriate risks and build their confidence. Each child's uniqueness is celebrated. Teachers' practices support children to develop a strong sense of belonging in this environment.</p><p>Teachers work with children in ways that are deeply respectful. They set a relaxed and calm pace to a routine that allows long periods of uninterrupted time for children to become engaged in and sustain their play. Teachers value children's ideas and listen well. They are thoughtful facilitators of children's learning and skilled at prompting more complex thinking.</p><p>Centre resources encourage children's critical thought and wondering. Teachers competently offer a wide curriculum that is strongly inclusive of literacy and mathematics. The programme is focused on holistic development and is responsive to each child's individual interests, preferences and learning levels. Children's developing social competence is very well supported.</p><p>Partnerships with parents and whānau are established through informal and formal meetings and conversations. Their aspirations for children's learning are discussed, recorded and responded to in very positive ways by teachers and centre leaders. The service is welcoming and inclusive to all children and their families.</p><p>The unique bicultural heritage of Aotearoa is authentically acknowledged in the environment and teaching practice. The service is strongly committed to creating an environment where differences in culture and belief are respected and celebrated. The well established relationships between teachers and parents and whānau allow them to learn from each other and value each one's uniqueness.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively to plan a programme that is responsive to children's interests, needs and abilities. Teachers analyse learning stories well. They identify children's individual learning and plan their responses to extend children's progress. Their evaluation of the programme is ongoing. This allows teachers to bring fresh ideas and to be responsive to ongoing learning. They skilfully weave together teacher initiated and child led activities and investigations.</p><p>Management has established a detailed framework of policies and procedures and a cycle of ongoing review. Very robust systems of internal evaluation and teacher appraisal are producing positive outcomes for children. Management is very supportive of teachers' aspirations for their own learning and development. Alignment is evident between annual and strategic plans, internal evaluation and teacher appraisal. The centre is very well led.</p><p>Teachers have established a culture of reflective practice that leads to ongoing development and improvement. They work well together as a team.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to continue to build their high quality provision for children's learning, the staff intend to focus on the continued development of their knowledge and use of te reo Māori. They also intend investigating ways the programme could further support children's opportunities to be truly creative and expressive.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kumeu Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kumeu Montessori Preschool will be in four years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>13 March 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
