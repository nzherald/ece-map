</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Waipuna Ariki O Matangireia is located in the rohe of Ngāti Awa. It is situated on the Te Tohu O Te Ora O Ngāti Awa complex, just out of Whakatane, on whenua of historical significance to Ngāti Awa. The centre was established in 2010 by Ngāti Awa Health and Social Services trust to give all whānau in the rohe the opportunity to send their tamariki to a bilingual early childhood centre that values Ngāti Awatanga.</p><p>The centre provides education and care for 59 tamariki, including 10 from birth to two years of age. All tamariki at the centre are Māori. The majority of tamariki are of Ngāti Awa descent, and the remaining children are affiliated to other iwi.</p><p>Trust and centre managers are very responsive to the diverse needs of tamariki, whānau and the local community. They demonstrate a strong commitment to equity and removing barriers to participation in early childhood education. The provision of transport to and from the centre has significantly increased opportunities for local tamariki to receive early childhood education.</p><p>The general manager of the trust has overall responsibility for the centre. The new education services manager (ESM) took over the management and educational leadership of the centre three months prior to this ERO review. The teaching team has participated in whole centre professional development on assessment. Ngā kaimahi ako ( teaching staff) include six kaiako who are qualified early childhood teachers and three support staff.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy affirms that it is founded in Ngāti Awatanga and Māoritanga, underpinned by Māori values and celebration of cultural identity and diversity. It aims to prepare tamariki by giving them a love of learning and supporting them to be persistent, resilient and to show awhi, manaaki and aroha to all. The centre values literacy and mathematical learning. It also aims to empower whānau to make informed decisions about education for their tamariki.</p><p>This is Te Waipuna Ariki o Matangireia’s first ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Tamariki experience close and trusting relationships with adults and other children. These positive relationships nurture the wairua and emotional wellbeing of tamariki. As a result tamariki settle well and demonstrate a strong sense of belonging. They play cooperatively, awhi and show aroha for their peers.</p><p>Pēpi and young toddlers experience a calm, respectful and loving environment. Kaimahi ako work in partnership with whānau to establish individual care routines for pēpi, and to meet their changing needs. Consistent caregiving allows pēpi and young toddlers to form strong and secure attachments with familiar adults. Kaimahi ako provide high-quality support for language development in te reo Māori and English.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy, including manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, Ngāti Awatanga and Māoritanga, is effectively implemented. Strengths of the programme include ongoing opportunities for tamariki to:</p><ul>
<li>experience success as Māori in an environment that strongly values and affirms their cultural identity</li>
<li>listen to high quality use of te reo Māori modelled by a significant number of kaimahi ako. As a result tamariki are very comfortable with the use of te reo, respond well to instructions, recite karakia, perform haka, sing waiata and himene, and often incorporate Māori words in their conversations</li>
<li>experience kawa, tikanga and te reo Māori in authentic and meaningful contexts such as pōwhiri, hui and tangihanga. This fosters their ability to operate confidently and competently in Māori and Pākehā contexts</li>
<li>learn about Ngāti Awatanga through haka, waiata, pepeha, and lively re-enactments of pūrākau (stories about ancestors)</li>
<li>explore mathematical and literacy concepts.</li>
</ul><p>Tamariki with identified learning needs are also well supported and included positively in the programme.</p><p>The ESM has significantly improved the quality and frequency of communication with whānau about their tamariki. Whānau find staff to be friendly, welcoming and approachable. A stronger focus on documenting the interests and learning of individual tamariki would make portfolios for older tamariki more meaningful for parents, and assist kaimahi ako to plan for emerging interests.</p><p>The ESM is providing clear and effective professional leadership. She is a strong advocate for tamariki and whānau and has made good progress in:</p><ul>
<li>developing a more reflective teaching team</li>
<li>building teaching practice through modelling, mentoring and coaching, and promoting a shared teaching philosophy</li>
<li>developing a more collaborative approach to centre decision making and self review.</li>
</ul><p>She is currently developing a more robust system of staff appraisal.</p><p>Centre management, staff, whānau and tamariki benefit greatly from the manaakitanga, whanaungatanga and wrap around support provided by Te Tohu o Te Ora o Ngāti Awa. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>its vision and commitment to adhere to Māori kawa (values)</li>
<li>modelling and sharing of expertise in te reo and tikanga Māori and Ngāti Awatanga</li>
<li>property and human resource management</li>
<li>provision of a wide range of education, health, social and support services, including targeted whānau education programmes</li>
<li>the centre’s building and premises and the use of trust facilities.</li>
</ul><p>The ESM keeps the general manager and trust well informed about the quality of education and outcomes for tamariki and whānau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO agreed with the general manager and ESM that their next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop strategic and annual action plans for centre improvement</li>
<li>align these plans with self review, appraisal and professional development priorities, and budget allocations accordingly</li>
<li>develop clear procedures for self review to assist kaimahi ako to further evaluate and improve the quality of education, including the learning environment and assessment practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Waipuna Ariki o Matangireia completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Waipuna Ariki o Matangireia will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>13 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
