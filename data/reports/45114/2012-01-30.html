<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Au Pair Link Christchurch is a home-based care service that provides early childhood education and care for children from birth to school age across the central Canterbury area.</p><p>The service is owned by Au Pair Link Limited which maintains a number of home-based care licences across the country. Au Pair Link Christchurch began operating in 2008. This is the first ERO review of the service.</p><p>The service recruits au pairs from overseas and arranges their placement in children&rsquo;s homes, where they live in with the families. Au pairs provide care and education for children, supported by a programme manager who is a qualified early childhood teacher.</p><p>Particular strengths of the service identified in this review are the:</p><ul>
<li>caring and nurturing relationships between children and au pairs</li>
<li>effective relationships and useful communication between au pairs, parents and programme managers</li>
<li>well-managed processes for supporting au pairs when entering the service and on exit from the homes</li>
<li>high level of support provided to au pairs and families from programme managers</li>
<li>effective management systems, including self review, that help put the service in a good position to sustain ongoing development.</li>
</ul><p>ERO and the service agree that priorities for review and development are continuing to strengthen assessment practices and the use te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The service&rsquo;s philosophy focuses on the importance of building and maintaining effective relationships to support children&rsquo;s learning. The focus is on family involvement, and au pairs taking an interest in each child and their ongoing development.</p><h3>Areas of good performance</h3><h4>Relationships</h4><p>Children benefit from the emphasis the service places on building and maintaining effective relationships between children, parents, au pairs and programme managers. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>caring and nurturing relationships, and unhurried interactions between children and their au pairs</li>
<li>au pairs working with children in ways that foster children&rsquo;s sense of well-being and confidence</li>
<li>au pairs noticing and responding well to the children&rsquo;s interests and needs</li>
<li>effective relationships between au pairs, parents, families and programme managers.</li>
</ul><h3>Communication</h3><p>Programme managers have developed a range of useful approaches to support communication between au pairs, families and service managers. They also provide good opportunities for regular social activities among the children and au pairs. Effective communication approaches include:</p><ul>
<li>focused monthly visits to homes including regular contact with parents before and after visits</li>
<li>the use of phone, email, and blogs to maintain contact with au pairs and parents</li>
<li>the use of au pair and parent surveys to inform future planning.</li>
</ul><h3>Transition</h3><p>The service has well-managed practices for supporting au pairs when entering the service and when leaving homes. Opportunities are provided for the au pair to establish relationships with families and children prior to their arrival in New Zealand and into the homes. There is a consistent focus on matching the most suitable au pair to suit the needs of the children and each family. The service continues to provide additional support for au pairs through regular events and outings.</p><h3>Programme</h3><p>Au pairs receive a high level of support from programme managers which is individualised to the needs of the au pair. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>ensuring visits focus on the well-being and the learning of the individual children</li>
<li>leading and guiding learning conversations with parents and the au pair about recognising and responding to children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>modelling ways of working with children to support their learning</li>
<li>taking a collaborative approach to writing learning stories and sharing knowledge about the children</li>
<li>encouraging au pairs to share their skills and strengths with other au pairs and children at playgroup</li>
<li>regular training opportunities.</li>
</ul><p>Children are benefiting from programmes that:</p><ul>
<li>include weekly playgroups and monthly outings to provide additional learning and social opportunities for them, their au pairs and families</li>
<li>provide them with a range of educational resources and information</li>
<li>support their listening, communication and language skills.</li>
</ul><h3>Management</h3><p>The service has useful policies and procedures to help guide au pair practices, including good information about bicultural practices. Service and programme managers make good use of their individual strengths, are highly reflective and focused on improvement. Self review is well developed and provides useful information to make improvements to the service.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>The service has identified, and ERO agrees, that the next step is to continue strengthening assessment practices and processes. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>developing further ways of working with au pairs that build on their strengths</li>
<li>making planning for children&rsquo;s learning clearer</li>
<li>making children&rsquo;s learning progress clearer in evaluations.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, managers are aware that the service&rsquo;s policies and procedures for supporting biculturalism could be more evident in au pairs&rsquo; practices. The next step is to extend the use of te reo M&#257;ori and tikanga M&#257;ori in the regular conversations and learning experiences provided for children.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing wellbeing, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><p>The service has clear policies and procedures to guide the inclusion and transition of children with moderate to severe special needs. Key aspects that also support inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs in this service are:</p><ul>
<li>the focus on partnerships with parents in all decisions, including careful placement of the most appropriate au pair for the child and family circumstances</li>
<li>effective systems for ongoing communication with parents to discuss the child&rsquo;s well-being, learning and development</li>
<li>specific support from programme managers and the use of their skills in supporting these children</li>
<li>opportunities for attending playgroups and social activities with other au pairs and children.</li>
</ul><p>The live-in nature of the au pair situation also allows for the au pair to be closely involved in the child&rsquo;s transition to other services or school.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>During visits to homes, ERO noticed that some items of furniture had been moved or repositioned since the home checks had been completed. As a result, in some homes there were some earthquake risks such as unsecured televisions and cabinets. Service managers responded promptly to eliminate the hazards that were identified.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>30 January 2012</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>
