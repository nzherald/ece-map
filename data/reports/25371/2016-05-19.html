</table><p>The owner and supervisor would benefit from external support to build leadership capacity and coherent management systems that support teachers to improve the curriculum for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Topcare Early Childhood Learning Centre is located in a residential area in Papatoetoe, Auckland. Full-day and sessional options are available for children from two to five years of age.</p><p>This centre is one of two privately owned Topcare Early Childhood Learning Centres. The owner is highly committed to serving families/whānau and the community. Relationships with whānau are central to the core values of respect, care and having fun that underpin the centre’s philosophy. The owner speaks with pride of the close links the centre has with the wider community.</p><p>A significant feature of the centre is the way children, whānau and staff celebrate and acknowledge a wide range of cultural heritages through the centre programme, social events and trips. The majority of the children have Indian heritage.</p><p>Since the 2012 review, the owner has appointed a new supervisor who is at the centre one day a week and other times, as needed. She and another teacher have recently been fully registered and a third teacher is provisionally registered. The fourth member of the teaching team is currently undertaking teacher training.</p><p>The owner and teachers have made some positive changes to the centre’s self review to address recommendations in the ERO 2012 report. Further work is still required to implement effective teacher appraisals, align strategic and annual plans, and to build leadership capacity within the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and play well together. They benefit from a homely environment where they are warmly greeted at the beginning of their day. Children and whānau are well known to teachers. Parents who spoke to ERO appreciate the open communication and responsive relationships they have with the centre. The use of social media and twice yearly home visits support ongoing communication between the centre and parents.</p><p>Children initiate their own learning and enjoy imaginative play. Teachers work alongside them, following their interests. Two separate buildings connect to an outside area, providing easy access for children to freely move between the different learning areas.</p><p>The staff are culturally diverse and parents are encouraged to share their cultural backgrounds. The owner and supervisor continue to be committed to developing bicultural practices and increasing teachers’ confidence in te reo and tikanga Māori. Children’s learning stories reflect the warm relationships that staff have with children. Some well developed portfolio examples clearly show children’s learning journeys. Teachers could now strengthen their recognition of children’s cultural identity in portfolio records.</p><p>Teachers plan collaboratively. They identify resources and activities to support learning. Children’s work is carefully displayed on centre walls. Teachers could now explore ways to develop parent’s understanding of their children’s learning and how it links to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Teachers have worked hard to record their reflections about their teaching practice. The owner and supervisor are keen to continue developing the quality of the programme. They plan to do this by further assessing the effectiveness of teaching practices, and considering how these practices respond to children’s learning and interests. This is an important next step for the centre.</p><p>Teachers are self-directed and dedicated, and report they work well as a team. The owner and supervisor also have a collegial working relationship. They have identified the need to link their leadership roles and responsibilities to job descriptions and to provide appropriate ongoing professional support to build leadership capacity within the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner, supervisor and staff would benefit from external support to help them bring about improvements in several key areas, including:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing the centre philosophy, vision and values as a team to better reflect the day-to-day teaching practices and the owner’s commitment to Te Tiriti ō Waitangi</li>
<li>refining and aligning strategic and annual plans and using self review to clearly identify next steps for the centre to support ongoing and sustainable improvements</li>
<li>developing more effective monitoring and reporting systems to focus on continuous improvement in management, teaching and learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Topcare Early Childhood Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practices the owner should:</p><ul>
<li>align job descriptions and teacher appraisals with The New Zealand Education Council requirements and identify centre-wide and individual teacher goals that specify ongoing professional development areas and identify training needs.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance. To address these, the owner must:</p><ul>
<li>establish and implement good employer and personnel management practices that promote good quality teaching practices and ongoing improvement</li>
<li>establish processes for monitoring and ensuring that the centre meets all legal requirements</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, section 6, 7 and 8 Education (ECS) Regulations 2008, 47c(i).</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Topcare Early Childhood Learning Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>19 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
