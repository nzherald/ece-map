<p>ERO&rsquo;s review of this kindergarten was interrupted by the significant earthquake that occurred in February 2011. Feedback to the teaching team and the writing of this report was delayed until September 2011. ERO and the kindergarten association agreed to complete this report as a large body of the work had already been undertaken prior to this earthquake.</p>
<p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mount Pleasant was located in the Mount Pleasant suburb of Christchurch. The kindergarten operated morning and afternoon sessions for up to 30 children over the age of two. All teachers are fully qualified and registered.</p>
<p>It is one of 63 kindergartens (including one early learning centre) administered by the Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens.</p>
<p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development.</p>
<p>The vision and philosophy of the kindergarten that children will be seen as individuals and recognised as learners was clearly evident in practice.</p>
<p>Other positive features of this kindergarten included:</p>
<ul>
<li>positive and affirming relationships and interactions between teachers and children, and among children</li>
<li>an interesting learning environment that encouraged children to explore, be creative and create their own challenges</li>
<li>a rich and varied programme with particular focus on music, creativity, literacy, drama and the natural world</li>
<li>teamwork among teachers and the use of teachers&rsquo; skills and interests to extend children&rsquo;s experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>The association has been proactive in addressing issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property.</p>
<p>The February earthquake extensively damaged the kindergarten building and grounds. Since that time the association has relocated the kindergarten into temporary premises which was again disrupted by the June earthquakes. Since June, the children have been offered places in three neighbouring Kidsfirst Kindergartens with a Mount Pleasant teacher placed in each of these kindergartens to support children and families. The association has identified the next step is to continue investigating options to rebuild this kindergarten.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the kindergarten was being managed in the interest of the children. The timing of the next review will depend on the re-establishment of the kindergarten.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mount Pleasant was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the kindergarten to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the kindergarten (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mount Pleasant.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The kindergarten vision stated that children will be seen as individuals and recognise their potential as learners. Children&rsquo;s contributions to groups will be valued and encouraged. Teachers wanted the environment to be appreciated and to reflect children&rsquo;s work and interests. The kindergarten&rsquo;s vision was clearly evident in practice.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<h5>Relationships</h5>
<p>There were positive and affirming relationships between teachers and children, and among children.</p>
<p>ERO observed:</p>
<ul>
<li>caring and nurturing interactions between teachers and children</li>
<li>teachers helping children share and play successfully together</li>
<li>children having good opportunities to be part of groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>Children&rsquo;s learning was further supported through the regular sharing of useful information between teachers and parents about children&rsquo;s home lives and interests.</p>
<p>Teachers worked well together and made effective use of their skills and interests to extend children&rsquo;s learning experiences.</p>
<h5>Learning environment</h5>
<p>Teachers had developed an interesting learning environment that encouraged children to explore, be creative and create their own challenges. This included:</p>
<ul>
<li>an outdoor environment that had a strong focus on the local environment and native plantings</li>
<li>many resources to support artistic expression</li>
<li>an extensive range of bicultural and natural resources.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Learning programme</h5>
<p>Children benefitted from a rich and varied programme. This included particular focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>music</li>
<li>drama</li>
<li>creativity</li>
<li>literacy</li>
<li>learning about the natural world.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the learning programme engaged boys well and encouraged the involvement of parents.</p>
<h5>Interactions</h5>
<p>Teachers interacted with children in ways that extended their ideas and interests. They regularly involved themselves in children&rsquo;s play and encouraged children&rsquo;s conversations. Extending higher level thinking had been a focus for the teaching team. In particular, ERO observed some effective questioning to help children think more deeply about their learning. The next step would be to continue to extend the use of this type of interaction.</p>
<h4>Area for development</h4>
<p>The February earthquake extensively damaged the kindergarten building and grounds. The association has been proactive in addressing issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property. The association has identified that the next step is to continue investigating options to rebuild this kindergarten.</p>
<a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mount Pleasant completed an ERO CentreManagement Assurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<p>This kindergarten was licensed under the Education (Early Childhood Centres) Regulations 1998. ERO looked at the above systems prior to the February earthquake. At the time, ERO identified no areas of concern.</p>

<p>ERO is confident that the kindergarten was being managed in the interest of the children. The timing of the next review will depend on the re-establishment of the kindergarten.</p>

<p>The association that governs this kindergarten is well organised and managed. It provides useful policies and procedures and a comprehensive framework for monitoring health and safety. The association incorporates management support in the form of education service managers and a manager of kindergarten operations who work in partnership with teachers providing ongoing leadership and professional development.</p>
<p>The vision and philosophy of the kindergarten that children will be seen as individuals and recognised as learners was clearly evident in practice.</p>
<p>Other positive features of this kindergarten included:</p>
<ul>
<li>positive and affirming relationships and interactions between teachers and children, and among children</li>
<li>an interesting learning environment that encouraged children to explore, be creative and create their own challenges</li>
<li>a rich and varied programme with particular focus on music, creativity, literacy, drama and the natural world</li>
<li>teamwork among teachers and the use of teachers&rsquo; skills and interests to extend children&rsquo;s experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>The association has been proactive in addressing issues associated with the Canterbury earthquakes relating to children, family, personnel and property.</p>
<p>The February earthquake extensively damaged the kindergarten building and grounds. Since that time the association has relocated the kindergarten into temporary premises which was again disrupted by the June earthquakes. Since June, the children have been offered places in three neighbouring Kidsfirst Kindergartens with a Mount Pleasant teacher placed in each of these kindergartens to support children and families. The association has identified the next step is to continue investigating options to rebuild this kindergarten.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the kindergarten was being managed in the interest of the children. The timing of the next review will depend on the re-establishment of the kindergarten.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the kindergarten or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>About ERO</h3>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each kindergarten&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a kindergarten, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this kindergarten has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of kindergarten performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this kindergarten.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a kindergarten is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this kindergarten.</p></html>
