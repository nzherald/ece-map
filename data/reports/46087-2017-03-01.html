</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>First Steps Vardon is located in the Hamilton suburb of Te Rapa. The centre occupies a renovated house for babies and toddlers and a converted church for children between two years and five years of age. The centre provides both all-day and sessional services for up to 16 babies and toddlers and 50 children over two years. Children from a variety of cultural backgrounds, including Māori and Pacific children attend the centre.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of BestStart Educare Ltd, which provides overall strategic direction and comprehensive systems to manage centre operations. The centre is focused on increasing the access of local parents and whānau to early childhood education. It's philosophy promotes respect for the values, culture and beliefs of all children, and recognises the importance of strong partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>Since the ERO review in 2013 the centre has responded positively to the areas identified for development. There have been some changes to staffing, and a centre manager and assistant manager have been promoted. There are a number of new teachers, and some teachers have different cultural backgrounds and expertise, which provide a richness to the programme.</p><p>BestStart employs business managers and professional service managers to monitor compliance with regulatory requirements, and establish and monitor quality early childhood education practices at each centre. These managers work alongside centre managers and head teachers to support their leadership, provide professional guidance, and mentor teachers as part of the appraisal and teacher registration process. BestStart has a strong emphasis on employing qualified and professionally capable teachers and providing professional development opportunities to grow their teaching and leadership skills.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Babies and toddlers benefit from a home-like atmosphere that is calm and spacious. Well-organised indoor and outdoor play areas provide access to moveable equipment, gardening opportunities, sensory exploration and age-specific furniture. Key teachers work with parents and whānau to create a settled drop-off, pick-up transition times for these very young children.</p><p>The importance of attachment is recognised and contributes to the care and wellbeing of babies and toddlers. Teachers understand the individual rhythms and preferences of babies and toddlers and politely invite them to participate in necessary and familiar routines. These nurturing teacher-child relationships are supported by strong teacher-parent partnerships.</p><p>Children over two are able to explore a wide range of activities, and accessible resources and equipment that promote creativity in play. They have opportunities to integrate resources across areas of play. A welcoming and inclusive atmosphere provides children from a range of backgrounds to play together, using books, dress-ups festivals, digital resources that are designed to make links with their culture.</p><p>Teachers plan collaboratively to extend children’s recognised interests. There is a good balance of teacher and child-initiated learning through play. Routines are well managed and provide predictability for all children throughout the day. Teachers extend children’s play and co-construct activities that add complexities to their learning. Social play provides opportunities for children to develop leadership and team skills. Respectful interactions between children and teachers nurture sense of belonging, which contributes to children feeling confident to take on challenges and take manageable risks.</p><p>Parents are often present in the centre and have many opportunities to participate in play and learning with their children. They share their aspirations for their children with teachers who gain a deep understanding of children’s home interests and experiences. Teachers share observations with parents through digital technologies and in portfolios. Parents are invited to attend evenings about their child’s development. These practices build strong relationships among the centre staff, parents, extended whānau and children.</p><p>Māori children and whānau appreciate their language and culture being valued and shared through daily karakia, waiata and other tikanga Māori practices. Children with diverse cultural needs are included, encouraged and affirmed. Teachers work collaboratively to implement a te reo Māori programme for children. This approach is building teacher capability in the use or te reo and tikanga Māori, and contributes to Māori children's identity and sense of belonging.</p><p>The centre manager has identified that it is important to maintain partnerships with whānau, particularly through digital portfolios. She is well supported by staff and promotes a collaborative team approach to leadership, which is soundly based on mutual respect and trust. Teachers are encouraged to manage their own professional learning and development, and to reflect on the outcomes of their practice.</p><p>Well-developed and rigorous quality assurance processes, professional, administrative and business support are facilitated by well-qualified and experienced personnel. Robust self-review systems guide review and strategic development in the centre. Teachers are well supported and frequently reflect on their practice to provide positive learning through play opportunities for children. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>It would be appropriate for centre managers and teachers to review assessment, planning and evaluation. Consideration should be given to the purpose of portfolios and how they play a complementary role with the digital edition to keep parents informed about their child's progress and learning. The following are likely to enhance children's understanding of their learning:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Children adding their own pictures and drawings to portfolios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue to build teaching practices that promote children's learning and readiness for school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The importance of recognising and recording children's cultural identity and sense of belonging in portfolios.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of First Steps Vardon completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of First Steps Vardon will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>1 March 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
