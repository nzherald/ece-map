</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Newmarket Playcentre operates as a parent-led cooperative in the Auckland City suburb of Remuera. The well established centre caters for up to 25 children per session from birth to six years of age, with five mixed-aged morning sessions each week. The Auckland Playcentre Association provides an administration framework of policies and procedures to support the centre’s operations. The Association also provides a comprehensive adult education programme and personnel to support members.</p><p>The Playcentre philosophy places importance on empowering adults and children to work, play, learn and grow together. The philosophy honours te Tiriti o Waitangi. Parents are valued and affirmed as the first and best educators of their children.</p><p>The centre has a positive ERO reporting history. The 2010 ERO report noted that children were well engaged in a programme that extended their play and interests. A high level of training amongst centre members was also noted. These positive characteristics continue to be evident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Playcentre philosophy is actively promoted in the centre’s everyday practice and, as a result, children are confident, competent, and independent learners. Their play is purposeful and children express themselves well.</p><p>Centre members affirm children’s efforts and encourage their involvement in a variety of learning activities. The programme supports mixed-age learning opportunities for all children, including infants and toddlers. Children are supported to develop early literacy and numeracy skills in meaningful ways within the different areas of play. Members model respectful practices, inviting themselves into children’s play and sharing responsibility for all children. As a result, children confidently initiate interactions and develop good social skills. Older children engage in cooperative play with each other.</p><p>Māori language and bicultural perspectives are meaningfully integrated into the programme and the learning environment. The inclusion of biculturalism in the programme is a recent development. The introduction has been led by a parent and is supported by all members. ERO encourages the centre to continue to explore the bicultural approach.</p><p>Effective planning and assessment practices help members to respond to individual children’s emerging strengths and interests. Members document children’s learning well, using learning stories, descriptions and photographs. These are included in individual portfolios, which are highly valued by the children and their families.</p><p>The centre environment is conducive to children’s learning. The well resourced centre provides children with very good opportunities for creative and physical play. Refreshment of the indoor environment has included provision of greater wall display space, which is used to display children’s art and to capture the learning that is happening in the centre. Members regularly review the environment to ensure that the positioning of equipment and resources meets the needs of the different ages of children attending.</p><p>The centre is well managed by centre members. Members have refined the Playcentre Association framework of policies and procedures to ensure they are meaningful to the centre’s specific needs. There is a culture of clear expectations and members are well informed and supported in their roles. All members are encouraged to take on leadership roles. These highly developed systems ensure the sustainability of good practices in the centre.</p><p>A reflective centre culture supports ongoing initiatives and improvements. Regular monitoring and review cycles inform strategic planning and decision making.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre members agree that the key next steps are:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to extend leadership opportunities for children</li>
<li>ensuring that session and programme evaluations focus on the learning that takes place as well as on the experiences provided for children</li>
<li>rationalising self-review processes</li>
<li>using an appreciative inquiry model of self review that captures successful initiatives and reflects on why they are going well.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Newmarket Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Newmarket Playcentre will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>20 June 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
