</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Beginnings Early Learning Centre, located on Auckland’s Waiheke Island, is licensed to provide full day care and education for 38 children, including up to 10 children aged under two years. Children aged under two are cared for in their own dedicated indoor and outdoor play spaces.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy strongly emphasises collaboration with families and links between the home and centre. The centre is well established, privately owned, and has maintained a core team of qualified teachers. A manager oversees the day-to-day operation of the centre.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report identified a number of areas of good practice which are still evident. These included strong relationships between the centre and families, effective programme implementation and bicultural practice.</p><p>Areas for development in 2012 included refining planning and evaluation processes, strengthening self review, and reviewing the environment in order to better support children’s creative and complex play. There has been progress in some of these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and settled and demonstrate a strong sense of belonging in the centre. They confidently approach adults, secure in the knowledge that their needs will be met. Teachers are responsive to the needs of individual children.</p><p>Older children choose resources and places to play in an environment that has recently been reviewed and upgraded. Developing friendships are evident and children engage in sustained periods of play. Effective interactions between teachers and children encourage children’s exploration and curiosity, while supporting the development of their complex thinking skills.</p><p>Consideration now needs to be given to the layout of the room for children under two years. Being able to access resources independently would allow these children opportunities to engage in play of their own choosing. It would also provide teachers with more time to observe and respond to the interests of individual children.</p><p>Parents who spoke with ERO expressed their appreciation of the service. Children’s individual portfolios show connections between home and the centre, and give insights about the continuity of children's learning journeys. Effective links are made between the centre programme, children’s learning and <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Presentation of documentation could be improved through professional development on ICT skills for teachers.</p><p>Head teachers are open to new thinking about programme planning. They are currently experimenting with, and refining, some new processes introduced by team members. The next step is to focus on and strengthen the way programmes are evaluated. Documented reflection on the effectiveness of teaching practice should be an integral part of this process.</p><p>A strong commitment to meaningful bicultural practice is evident across the centre. Teachers confidently use te reo Māori in their conversations with children. The commitment to inclusive practice is also evident in the centre environment and teaching practice. The team is currently reflecting on how they might do more to support and embrace the cultures of all children, particularly those of Pacific Island heritage.</p><p>The teaching team is developing shared understandings of the purpose and features of effective, long-term self review. The recent introduction of externally facilitated and ongoing professional development is supporting this development. The centre goal is to streamline and strengthen links between self review, annual and strategic planning, and staff appraisal processes. This should have a beneficial impact on the team’s capacity to evaluate the quality of centre practices and help to bring about ongoing improvements in its performance.</p><p>The centre owner has put in place a framework of policies and procedures to guide centre practice. Priority now needs to be given to reviewing and revising these to align them with Ministry of Education guidelines and recent changes to legislation. A review of the staff appraisal process is also needed to ensure it includes input from individual teachers and assessment against the Practising Teacher Criteria.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to continue to promote positive learning outcomes for children, centre leaders should now:</p><ul>
<li>review the layout of the play areas for children under two years to allow more space to play and to provide children with more space to play and access to a wide range of quality resources</li>
<li>strengthen programme evaluation processes to include documented reflection on teaching practice</li>
<li>establish shared understandings about effective self review purposes and procedures across the team and engage in meaningful review with a focus on improving outcomes for children</li>
<li>undertake a thorough review of current policies and procedures to ensure they align with Ministry of Education guidelines and current legislation</li>
<li>review and refine teacher appraisal processes to include teacher self reflection, strong links to the Practicsing Teacher Criteria and action plans for appropriate professional development.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Beginnings Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Beginnings Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>2 October 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
