</table><p>The association is well placed to support the kindergarten’s key developmental needs.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Raureka Kindergarten is located in Hastings and provides education and care for children from two to five years of age. It is licensed for up to 30 children, six hours daily. Children are representative of a diverse community. Teachers promote an awareness of sustainable practices and are members of the Enviroschool project.</p><p>Since the November 2010 ERO report, there have been a number of staff changes in the kindergarten. A permanent head teacher was employed in term one 2014, and two teachers remain in relieving positions. The teaching team is fully qualified and the kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association (the association). Two Education Managers are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers. This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergartens in the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in a play-based programme for sustained periods of time. They play independently and cooperatively in groups of their own choosing. At times, teachers work alongside them following these self initiated interests. Some teachers use a range of appropriate responses to engage children in play and learning. A key next step is consistency in the use, by staff, of a wider variety of teaching strategies to support and extend children’s learning.</p><p>Teachers establish warm, welcoming and responsive relationships with children and whānau, supporting children’s sense of belonging. Flexible routines provide a framework for the day. Children with additional needs are supported by teachers. Staff liaise with external agencies to support the children and family where appropriate.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy has recently been reviewed. Teachers have identified that a key next step in this process is to collectively develop clear indicators of what high quality practice looks like for the curriculum. ERO affirms this direction and suggests this consideration should also include assessment, planning and evaluation. These indicators of high quality practice will be useful in guiding self review and future decision making.</p><p>Profiles provide an insight into the activities children engage in and their developing relationships. A next step is for staff to show, through the assessment documentation, the significance of children’s interests. Teachers should clearly indicate how they plan to use this information to add depth and complexity to children’s learning to highlight progress overtime. Parents' aspirations should be more formally sought and reflected in each child’s learning.</p><p>Children’s social and emotional competence is not consistently supported by teachers. A shared understanding of the expectations of teachers needs to be developed and consistently enacted by all staff. The teaching team also need to be more aware of supporting one another when supervising children in the wider kindergarten environment.</p><p>Teachers are continuing to build their confidence and competence in the use of te reo Māori and strengthening their understanding of te ao Māori through participating in initiatives supported by the association. Success for Māori and Pacific families should be further enhanced through consulting with whānau and families about cultural aspirations they may have for their children. Teachers should work as a team to promote a planned and culturally responsive approach.</p><p>There is awareness by teachers of the importance of celebrating aspects of multiculturalism. This practice requires ongoing development to deepen teachers’ knowledge and responsiveness to the cultures reflected in the kindergarten community. In addition, consideration should be given to how the strengths of this approach can be embedded in practice to ensure sustainability.</p><p>A recent development has been an increase in the number of children attending kindergarten who are under three years of age. Teachers reflect on the curriculum to ensure it meets the specific requirements of a group of younger children. Teachers have identified a key next step for them is to participate in professional learning opportunities focusing on working with younger children. ERO's evaluation affirms this key step.</p><p>A range of relevant information is available for parents to support them in their child’s transition to school. Teachers have identified this as an area that is under development.</p><p>Self review is in the early stages of development. In order to strengthen self review and evaluation, teachers should develop a clearer understanding of the process and build their evaluative capacity.</p><p>The association provides guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. The recently developed strategic plan provides a clear long term direction for the association. Teachers are well supported through regular visits from the education managers who provide professional support and guidance and access to a wide range of professional learning opportunities.</p><p>There is a commitment by the association to increase teachers’ capabilities through the introduction of the Haere Whakamua project. This project is based around progressing the organisation’s journey in becoming bicultural.</p><p>The association identifies and ERO affirms that key areas for development include:</p><ul>
<li>updating the appraisal process and policy</li>
<li>providing clear expectations, through guiding documents for programme delivery and kindergarten operations and monitoring their implementation.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, education managers should undertake strategic review and evaluation across the association to establish a deeper understanding of the ongoing professional learning needs of teachers and use this information to inform future decision making.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>use the philosophy to develop shared indicators of best practice</li>
<li>be more intentional in the teaching strategies used to promote learning</li>
<li>further develop assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>consistently support children’s social and emotional competence</li>
<li>improve team work in supervising children</li>
<li>consult with Māori and Pacific families about cultural aspirations</li>
<li>deepen all teachers' knowledge of and responsiveness to working with diverse cultures</li>
<li>continue to develop teachers' knowledge and skills in working with younger children and transition-to-school processes</li>
<li>strengthen self review and evaluation.</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>establish and review current guiding documents and monitor implementation</li>
<li>build and strengthen strategic self review at association level</li>
<li>monitor the strategic use of equity funding in this kindergarten.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Raureka Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Raureka Kindergarten will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>14 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
