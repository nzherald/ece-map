</table><p>Toddlers Turf Childcare Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Toddlers Turf Childcare Centre is a well-established service licensed for 75 children, including 18 up to the age of two years. The majority of children attending have Māori or Pacific heritages. Some children have had whānau members previously attending this centre.</p><p>A parent committee oversees the governance and management of the service. The long-serving centre manager is supported by 12 qualified teachers, two teachers in training, a cook and an administrator. A professional practice manager also works with the team.</p><p>The centre's philosophy prioritises children learning through play and the formation of strong relationships. Teachers aim to support children to become confident learners.</p><p>ERO's 2015 report noted positive aspects, such as strong relationships and opportunities for children to direct their own play. These aspects continue to be present. Improvements were required in curriculum planning and teachers' extension of children's learning. Some progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children demonstrate a sense of belonging and wellbeing. They confidently engage in conversations with each other and with teachers. They are friendly and play well together, often in mixed-age groups, in a well-resourced environment.</p><p>Teachers work with children and whānau in supportive ways to ensure that children's transitions into the centre are managed effectively. They are responsive and respectful in their interactions with children, reflecting the centre's philosophy. Infants' and toddlers' teachers are caring, attentive and responsive to their individual needs.</p><p>Teachers working with older children use open-ended questions and encourage children to think about their play. They could build on their well-established relationships with children to develop partnerships in the learning process. Increasing children’s access to a wider range of natural, creative, and challenging resources would enhance children's play and add complexity to their learning.</p><p>Teachers promote bicultural practices in the centre through the use of te reo Māori, and the provision of resources and relevant displays. They could strengthen how they record their response to promote Māori, Pacific and other children's languages and cultures in documentation, including their assessment of children's learning.</p><p>Teachers use <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, to support and inform their programme planning. They know children well and record individual children's extended learning. Teachers agree that they should align assessment and planning more closely to make their role in extending children's learning more visible to parents. Improving the documentation of how they promote children’s thinking and exploration would help teachers to increase the extent to which the service's curriculum focus is enacted.</p><p>The teaching team is open to new learning. Leaders are committed to supporting teachers' professional practice through a new appraisal system. Relevant professional learning and development supports teachers to continue developing the quality of assessment and planning.</p><p>There are collaborative interactions between teachers and parents/whānau. The parent committee's good understanding of their governance role is well documented in committee meeting minutes.</p><p>A robust internal evaluation framework helps to identify areas for improvement. Changes are made in response to this evaluation. Strategic and annual plans, operational systems, and policies and procedures guide centre operations. Some policies require review to ensure that they reflect current teaching practices, and some practices need to be better implemented to reflect policies.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for leaders and teachers include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>evaluating and recording the effectiveness of teachers' practices in extending and planning for children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that parents are actively involved in policy review, and assessment of their children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recording the impact of internal evaluation on outcomes for children and whānau.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Toddlers Turf Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>21 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
