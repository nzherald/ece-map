</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Orchards Preschool-Douglas Street 2, located in Whakatane, provides education and care for children from three years to school age. Known as the Kowhai and Pohutukawa rooms, it is one of four Little Orchards licences on the same site. The centre is licenced for up 55 children across both rooms. At the time of this ERO review the centre had a total roll of 128, including 60 children of Māori descent.</p><p>Little Orchard’s philosophy makes a commitment to creating a warm, loving and safe environment that complements the home and reflects New Zealand’s unique natural heritage. Core values associated with whānau/family, respect, adventure and passion are also promoted. The Kowhai and Pohutukawa rooms have a particular focus on child-initiated play and exploration as valued learning.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in June 2012 there have been significant changes to the Little Orchards’ organisation. A new general manager has been appointed as well as a centre leader, to provide professional leadership for all of the Douglas Street licences. Each room has a leader who provides day-to-day direction for staff and an overview of the programme. Seven of the nine staff members are qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>As was the case at the time of the previous ERO review, children in these rooms (dependent of age) are also enrolled at Little Orchard Douglas Street 40332 or Little Orchard Alexander Avenue 45095 for mornings or afternoons. This change-over is so that children also experience an approach to teaching and learning that is based on the teachings of Maria Montessori. The 2012 ERO report identified a need for centre leaders to review this structure in order to promote continuous learning pathways for children. The centre has surveyed teachers and parents as part of a self review of the transition process and the survey response was positive. ERO asks that there is an ongoing review and monitoring of this practice to continue to raise and maintain the quality of this practice for ensuring security and confidence for individual children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Room leaders have complementary skills and strengths. They work well together and provide effective leadership for their teams. Leaders make a valued contribution to the strategic direction of Little Orchards through the development of bicultural practices, te reo and tikanga Māori. They are acknowledged by management for their strong work ethic, belief in children as learners and are seen as positive role models for other staff. The room leaders also work collaboratively with the centre leader and other room leaders in the Little Orchards organisation with a strong focus on meeting the needs of children and families.</p><p>Children benefit from having opportunities to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>follow their interests, set their own goals and challenges in a child-initiated and play-based programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>take an interests and develop skills in literacy, mathematics, science and creative arts in contexts that are meaningful to them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop relationships with both older and younger peers in an inclusive environment that celebrates diversity and supports needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to explore, play and learn in the spacious and well-designed indoor and outdoor areas that feature a wide range of equipment and resources, fruit trees, vegetable gardens and significant grassed areas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>readily access carefully presented equipment and resources, particularly in the Pohutukawa room, that is maintained throughout the day, with teachers fostering children’s sense of responsibility for the learning environment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO observed high levels of sustained and meaningful play by individuals and small groups of children. Well-managed, flexible routines support children to sustain their play throughout the morning. The programme is enhanced by trips into the local environment as well as attendance at important community events.</p><p>Individual assessment portfolios are well presented and provide a record of children’s participation in aspects of the programme. They are easily accessible for both children and their parents. Teachers are strengthening their assessment, planning and evaluation understanding and practices. The use of learning story assessments to show how programme experiences have supported children’s learning is an example of good evaluation practice.</p><p>Children are happy and settled. They benefit from the calm and settled atmosphere created by teachers who foster a culture of care and respect. Teachers engage in play alongside children, adding depth to their play, ideas and learning through meaningful conversations, questions and responses.</p><p>The new general manager has established useful systems, and policies and procedures that support the general operations of the Little Orchards licences. A clear strategic plan has been developed to guide centre development. This plan is regularly monitored by the general manager and owners. A comprehensive teacher appraisal process has been introduced. The general manager should now align these processes to meet the requirements of the Education Council. The centre owners’ commitment to providing a quality service is reflected in the extensive professional development that is made available to teaching staff.</p><p>Teachers place priority on establishing meaningful relationships with parents. However, the current approach to moving children between the two separate licences each day hinders teachers’ ability to establish meaningful learning partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>Teachers are well supported by room leaders to regularly use te reo Māori in their daily interactions with children. They acknowledge the importance of incorporating local Māori history, traditions and places of significance into the programme. This needs to be an area for ongoing development.</p><p>The centre leader has a reflective approach to ongoing development and has been working hard to strengthen communication among teachers across all Douglas Street and Alexandra Street licences. She has established positive relationships with teachers, parents and children. Priority should be given to providing ongoing support for the centre leader to strengthen leadership for learning across this service. The room leader has a strong focus on improvement and development of the Tui room. She has successfully led the review of the room’s programme. The room leader works collaboratively with teachers in the Tui room and accesses support and guidance from the centre leader and other room leaders in the Little Orchards organisation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre leaders are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Relook at the daily interchange of children between the three rooms with a view to to minimising transitions and interruptions to children’s learning pathways, and to build stronger continuity and learning partnerships with children, parents and whānau.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue to develop assessment records to more consistently capture children’s learning and development over time, including their interests, passions and dispositions. In addition, strengthen the alignment between assessments of children and programme planning for extending their learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide professional development for centre leaders and teachers to strengthen self review by enhancing collective understanding and involvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service works with the Ministry of Education to undertake in-depth self review of daily transitions for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Orchard Preschool Douglas St 2 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Orchard Preschool Douglas St 2 will be in three years. </p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>21 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><div>

</div><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
