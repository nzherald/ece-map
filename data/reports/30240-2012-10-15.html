<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Home Grown Kids is a home-based care service operating three networks within the Auckland region. The Northland network provides a service in the northern suburbs of Auckland City. It caters for infants and children up to five years of age. Education and care programmes are provided by educators within their own homes or by nannies in the child&rsquo;s home.</p><p>ERO&rsquo;s observations of, and discussions with, a sample group of educators and nannies in the Home Grown Kids Auckland (Northland)) network informed this review of the service.</p><p>Managers have continued to develop and refine highly effective operational systems that are resulting in positive outcomes for children and their families. Parents speak with appreciation about the service provided. Open and inclusive communication processes are a key feature of the network&rsquo;s effectiveness. Good provision is made for the ongoing professional development of the coordinator who supports the quality of educational programmes. This professional development is impacting positively on the education and care delivered by educators and nannies.</p><p>Respectful and trusting relationships are a strength of the Home Grown Kids organisation. Children demonstrate a sense of belonging and confidence. The educational programmes provided for children are consistent in quality and care is highly personalised. The coordinator, educators and nannies know children well and provide appropriate resources to extend learning.</p><p>Learning programmes are responsive to individual children&rsquo;s interests and strengths. Children&rsquo;s diverse backgrounds are recognised and valued. A record of children&rsquo;s progress is evident in learning journals. Literacy learning is integrated frequently into children&rsquo;s play activities.</p><p>ERO&rsquo;s 2009 report commented on the variation in assessment, planning and evaluation of the curriculum across the network. Curriculum systems have been improved and strengthened. Modelling of good practices by the coordinator is resulting in a high level of professional practice among nannies and educators.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Educators and nannies are supported in providing education and care programmes for children by a coordinator, who is a qualified, registered early childhood teacher.</p><h3>Areas of good performance</h3><p><em>Respectful relationships.</em> Children enjoy warm, positive relationships with adults and each other. Open and respectful communication between the coordinator, educators, nannies and families is a strength of the Home Grown Kids organisation. Adults engage very naturally with children and are skilful at building children&rsquo;s social and interpersonal skills to enable them to play co-operatively.</p><p><em>Personalised care</em>. Educators and nannies provide high quality care and view children&rsquo;s wellbeing as essential in supporting learning. Good systems are in place to provide individual routines and attention to children as required.</p><p><em>Professional leadership.</em> The coordinator has established friendly and open relationships with the educators and nannies, and provides high quality support for children&rsquo;s learning. She provides ongoing professional development and modelling for educators and nannies to link and further extend children&rsquo;s learning. Careful consideration is given to providing appropriate education and care for different ages. The coordinator gives good support to educators and nannies so that they understand ways to assess and record children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p><em>Educational programmes.</em> Children enjoy learning programmes that are child initiated and responsive to their interests and emergent ideas. Educators and nannies participate alongside children in their play and stimulate their curiosity. They provide a good range of activities and learning experiences to ensure that children have variety and choice throughout the day. Early literacy and numeracy skills are skilfully integrated in play activities in ways that are meaningful for children. Children demonstrate an interest in learning and persevere at tasks.</p><p><em>Cultural responsiveness.</em> Children benefit from adults&rsquo; ongoing commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment. Children&rsquo;s languages and cultures are acknowledged and celebrated. Educators and nannies respect and use the first languages of children to promote their sense of belonging and wellbeing. Education programmes reflect New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage by incorporating M&#257;ori language and using resources that reflect traditional M&#257;ori culture.</p><p><em>Playgroup sessions.</em> Playgroup is a purposeful experience for educators, nannies and children. Children benefit from opportunities to play alongside other children and enjoy learning activities that build on their strengths and interests. Educators and nannies develop supportive social connections and share their knowledge with each other. Adults take active steps to build relationships and work with all children.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>ERO and managers agree that the coordinator could continue to develop and use self-review processes to enhance programmes provided for children, including review of the effectiveness of playgroup planning and evaluation records.</p><p>Developing long term and annual goals could also support effective planning for continued improvement at a regional and national level.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Home Grown Kids (Northland) completed an ERO Home-Based Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendations</h2><p>ERO and service managers agree that managers should use self review to enhance existing high quality practices.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>15 October 2012</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>
