</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Golden Kids Early Learning Centre is a community-based centre that provides care and education for children aged from birth to five years of age. The centre has a long waiting list for available spaces. It has good links with local schools that support children to transition successfully to school.</p><p>The day-to-day running of the centre is managed by the head teacher and administrator with the support of a parent board. The centre has stable staffing and leadership. There is a commitment to employing trained staff and actively encouraging and supporting potential future early childhood teachers.</p><p>The strengths identified in the March 2012 ERO report have been retained and built on. The centre responded well to the areas for improvement identified and has made the most progress in improving appraisal and aspects of assessment.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre’s philosophy is shared by its community, and highly evident in centre practices.</p><p>Children play and learn in an environment that supports their sense of wellbeing and belonging. Teachers provide a daily programme that is calm and settled with routines that are flexible, well paced, familiar and meaningful for children. Babies' and toddlers' needs are well catered for in a programme that respects their choices and preferences, and gives them the space and time to lead their learning.</p><p>Teachers develop respectful relationships with children and their families and help children develop good relationships with others. They have developed useful strategies, such as home visits, to help children extend their relationships beyond the centre and make stronger links between the centre and their home lives.</p><p>Parent contributions are valued. Teachers seek parents’ aspirations, views and contributions to the programme. The centre provides further opportunities for parent involvement through the parent board. The centre makes good use of its location next to community services to provide additional support to parents and families, when needed.</p><p>The centre’s curriculum is strongly influenced by following children’s interests which are providing many opportunities for children to take the lead in their own learning. Children spend prolonged periods of time engaged in play which is actively and skilfully supported by teachers.</p><p>A feature of the centre is the significant work undertaken to successfully promote stronger te reo and tikanga Māori practices. The centre has implemented a wide range of strategies, including ongoing teacher professional development, and successfully engaged with the local Māori community to make this happen. Children benefit from the significant opportunities they have to learn about and celebrate the Māori culture and language.</p><p>Key features of the environment are:</p><ul>
<li>the wide range of learning experiences and resources, including real-life resources, that support children’s exploratory play</li>
<li>the good opportunities children have to explore the natural outdoor environments that reflect their own community, and learn about the natural world</li>
<li>how teachers extend the learning environment by making use of regular trips into the local community to extend children’s learning experiences.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have developed thoughtful and purposeful group planning practices that help them focus on the ways they will extend and build on children’s interests and individual characteristics. This planning also shows that teachers regularly evaluate and adapt programmes and teaching practices to better promote children’s learning. Displays about children’s learning interests are attractively presented they support parents and children to talk together about what children are doing during the programme.</p><p>The centre benefits from strong professional leadership that is improvement focused and supports well-considered decision making. The head teacher actively uses and builds on staff strengths in ways that result in shared leadership. This is resulting in a strong sense of teamwork and a collaborative approach among staff.</p><p>The teaching team is reflective about its practices. Centre leaders have implemented some useful systems for monitoring practices, such as giving regular feedback to teachers on the quality of assessment and planning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that key next steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening planned self reviews by narrowing their focus, extending the use of success criteria and broadening the range of information gathered</li>
<li>building on some aspects of assessment, including exploring further ways to document how children’s learning has progressed over time, and showing their language, culture and identity more in individual children’s learning records.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Golden Kids Inc. Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Since the onsite stage of the review, the centre has appointed a Privacy Officer and begun to develop an overarching policy to help guide the centre’s privacy practices. ERO recommends the centre also reviews its child protection policy to ensure that it clearly supports section 15 of the Children, Young Persons and Their Families Act 1989.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Golden Kids Inc. Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>5 May 2015</p><h4>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h4><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

<li>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</li>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
