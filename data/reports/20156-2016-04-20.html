</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The centre provides all day care and education for 140 children across five rooms, in two adjacent buildings. Up to 40 children under two years are catered for in two of these rooms.</p><p>The teaching team is very well qualified. The centre owner and centre manager work closely to govern and manage the service effectively. There is a clear focus on ongoing improvement and the centre has a positive ERO reporting history.</p><p>The centre philosophy is founded on genuine and respectful relationships, the celebration of cultural diversity and the integral place of partnerships with parents/whānau, based on children's learning and development. A recently developed mission statement describes the service's vision for the provision of an environment that allows children to be children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are active, independent learners who confidently lead their play. They move easily around the centre and their play flows well. The well-paced, interesting programme supports their social and imaginative play. Children make decisions, share their ideas and help determine the course of the daily programme. Upgrades to learning environments continue, adding challenge and choice for children.</p><p>Teachers provide inclusive, respectful care that promotes children's growing independence and self-help skills. Teachers are aware of and respond to, children’s needs and preferences. They view children as confident and capable and provide a responsive programme that caters well for children's interests. Care for others is nurtured through teachers' consistent positive guidance strategies.</p><p>Sound teaching practice is evident across the centre. Teachers are adaptive and regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the programme and their teaching practice. Teams work well together in their rooms and across the service. Work continues on achieving centre-wide consistency of planning and programme documentation.</p><p>Genuine relationships are a key priority for the centre. Children and families are well known to staff and included in discussions about centre development and evaluation. Learning is shared with parents/whānau in a timely way, helped by the introduction of an online programme. Records of centre celebrations and events, newsletters and daily programme information are posted to keep families well informed.</p><p>An ongoing focus on children's physical wellbeing and healthy eating is supported by participation in the Healthy Heart programme and other external programmes to promote active movement. Through this focus the centre has been awarded the Heart Foundation's Healthy Heart Gold Award. The centre makes good use of community resources such as the local park to add interest for children.</p><p>High quality leadership is evident and staff are supported by very good employer practices. Teachers' strengths are recognised and authentic opportunities for leadership build capability. Dedicated time for these roles allows for support and assistance to be given to others. Access to a good variety of professional learning and development and good quality internal mentoring processes build teachers' professional knowledge.</p><p>Provision for Māori children and their whānau is a current, internally led focus. Aspirations for their children's learning have been sought from each Māori whānau and work is underway to respond to the ideas shared. Strategies to build skill and confidence amongst staff in te ao Maori across the centre are also in progress. <em>Tātaiako - Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em>, could be useful for teachers in this area.</p><p>Governance and management systems are well planned and implemented. An effective system to gather evidence and monitor the achievement of strategic goals is in place. Highly effective, collaborative centre evaluation occurs on a range of levels. Regular reflection and open discussion guides changes to practices and structures to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree with ERO that work should continue to ensure that the annual appraisal process aligns to and provides evidence that teachers meet each of the Education Council's practising teacher criteria.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Glen Eden completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Lollipops Educare Glen Eden will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>20 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
