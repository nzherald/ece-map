<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Seedlings Education 2 is one of two licences operating as part of the Seedlings Education home-based service in Auckland. The service provides education and care for children up to six years of age. Many of the educators are extended family members who care for up to four children in the child&rsquo;s home. Two programme coordinators who are qualified and registered early childhood teachers support educators to plan and provide educational programmes for children.</p><p>Children benefit from familiar environments and respectful relationships with educators who care about them and respond to their interests. Educators support children&rsquo;s exploration through affirming interactions that encourage play and fun. Children have opportunities to participate in a variety of learning experiences in their homes and during planned group outings. The service could now consider ways to strengthen practices that promote the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>Skilled coordinators model ways to engage children in learning through play. Families are able to borrow equipment and resources to support the extension of children&rsquo;s learning. Educators and coordinators maintain records that document children&rsquo;s participation in individualised programmes. Professional development courses contribute to improved educator teaching and curriculum practices.</p><p>The four owners/directors have made good use of recommendations from ERO&rsquo;s previous review of Seedlings Education 1 in 2012. They are focused on continuous improvement and are committed to providing a quality home-based education and care service. An organisational framework to guide operations and practice is well established. Owners have worked with coordinators to make very good improvements to health and safety systems. ERO and the owners agree that self review could be used more effectively to promote good quality outcomes for children and contribute to organisational improvements.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Seedlings Education 2 provides support for educators located mainly in North and West Auckland. Twenty-eight children are currently enrolled in this service.</p><p>During the course of this review ERO visited four homes. Managers, parents, educators and coordinators all contributed to the findings of this review.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><p>Relationships between adults and children are caring and respectful. Positive interactions support children&rsquo;s wellbeing and confidence. A high level of educator enthusiasm encourages children&rsquo;s independence and exploration. Children have access to appropriate resources and opportunities in indoor and outdoor areas and through excursions and participation in playgroups. Coordinators plan to review transition to school approaches to provide further information and guidance for parents and educators of older children.</p><p>Parents have good opportunities to share their aspirations for their child&rsquo;s learning. Educators and coordinators know children very well and use this information to provide programmes that are based on children&rsquo;s interests and stages of development. Coordinators find ways to build educators&rsquo; understanding of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. As a result of professional development, educators are developing increased knowledge of how to record the learning that happens as children play.</p><p>Coordinators model very good quality practices and develop warm relationships with children and educators. They share ideas to promote children&rsquo;s learning. Coordinators help educators to plan ways to support children to achieve learning goals. They provide families and educators with information and guidance through visit notes, emails and phone calls. Educators and families report that they value the knowledge and expertise of coordinators.</p><p>Owners have worked with coordinators to improve management processes. Very good improvements have been made to health and safety systems. Owners and coordinators continue to work positively with families and educators to meet the requirements of the 2008 early childhood licensing criteria. Consultation with educators and families contributes to improved communication and is beginning to guide future direction of the service.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The owners/directors and ERO agree that key areas for development are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to focus on the coordinators&rsquo; role in promoting ongoing improvement in educator practices and in modelling planning and assessment approaches during playgroups</li>
<li>link appraisal systems for coordinators to the Registered Teacher Criteria and set appropriate goals to enhance coordinator practices</li>
<li>establish documented self-review processes that focus on improved educational outcomes for children</li>
<li>develop long-term and annual plans containing education and management goals to guide ongoing service-wide improvement.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Seedlings Education 2 completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>21 February 2014</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>
