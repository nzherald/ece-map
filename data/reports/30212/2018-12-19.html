</table><p>Morrinsville Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Morrinsville Early Learning Centre is an all-day, mixed-age group, education and care service located in the Waikato town of Morrinsville. It is licensed for 40 children including up to 16 under the age of two years. Currently there are 44 children enrolled with seven who identify as Māori.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy aims to promote an environment that allows children to engage in sustained play and learning throughout the day in a purposefully unstructured programme. Its ‘Whānau Care’ system aims to ensure each child and their whānau have a key teacher that they develop and maintain a strong partnership with.</p><p>The centre operates under the governance and management of Central North Island Early Education Services Trust and the Central North Island Kindergarten Association Trust, community not for profit organisations. The overarching philosophy is to provide centres that enable children to reach their full potential, learn through play, and be supported by passionate professional people.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2015, a new centre manager and six new teachers have been appointed. New leaders and teachers have improved and strengthened systems and processes that promote positive outcomes for children. The centre has a positive ERO reporting history.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews in the Central North Island Early Education Services Trust</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive and respectful relationships underpin all aspects of teaching and learning. There has been a significant focus for leaders to provide individual wrap-around support for children and their families. Teachers are responsive to the holistic development of children, and understand the importance of learning in the context of family. Children experience many opportunities to be creative, use their imagination and explore, and develop learning dispositions that will support lifelong learning.</p><p>The curriculum is responsive and inclusive to all children's needs and abilities. A commitment is made to value social competence and fairness. Strengths of the curriculum are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>individual programmes that provide support for children who require additional learning from other specialised agencies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>relationships promoted by teachers, and working in partnership with families to strongly support children's wellbeing and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>transitions that are sensitively managed.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation capture children's interests well. Progress and continuity of learning is evident in assessment practice, and children’s success in learning is celebrated. Literacy, mathematics and some aspects of te reo and tikanga Māori are naturally interwoven into children’s play and learning.</p><p>Children under the age of two years benefit from specific teachers who know them well and provide a programme that is responsive to their interests and individualised care needs. They engage in sustained play, interruptions are minimal and children lead their own learning. Young children are viewed as capable to make choices and are well supported to develop resilience and perseverance.</p><p>Leaders have effectively developed sustainable systems and processes. They promote a shared understanding of the centre's philosophy, vision and goals, and have developed a respectful and collaborative team culture. Teachers are empowered to build their leadership skills to increase capability and capacity. Internal evaluation has been strengthened and supports ongoing improvement throughout the centre. Children experience a learning environment where decision making is focused on positive outcomes for learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Governance and management have comprehensive, well-established systems and practices to enable the organisation to monitor, evaluate and plan for the improvement of its early learning centres. Clear guidelines and expectations for centre practice and curriculum are strongly fostered by the leadership team and trust. The vision and values support positive outcomes for children's learning, wellbeing and that of their whānau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to build systems, processes and practices to further enrich a bicultural curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop centre assessment and planning practices to ensure a stronger focus on children's language, culture and identity</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Morrinsville Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Morrinsville Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>19 December 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
