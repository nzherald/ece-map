</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>St Clair Corner Early Learning Centre aims to provide a home away from home for children from two-to-five years of age. The centre provides a mixed-age programme for children with a strong focus on nature and the use of natural resources.</p><p>The centre licence has been recently changed so that it can now cater for fifty-four children.</p><p>The centre works closely with its sister centre, especially when transitioning children from one centre to the other. At the time of this review shared staff supported this movement. A unique feature of the centre is the high proportion of male teachers.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers have made good progress in responding to the recommendations in the March 2011 ERO report. They have sought input from parents and teachers about what is going well in the centre and what can be improved. They have an ongoing focus on developing children’s communication and oral language skills and biculturalism. They have been developing the way information and communication technologies (ICT) are used to support learning and teaching.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of two reviews in the St Clair Corner organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Early Learning Centre provides a warm welcome to children and their parents and whānau. Children quickly settle on arrival and become comfortable with centre routines. This is achieved through the caring relationships established by the staff, and skilful use of tuakana/teina relationships (peer support). Children are given many opportunities to explore the various areas of the centre and engage in the range of experiences prepared by their teachers.</p><p>The centre environment and resources strongly reflect the natural world. These are purposefully provided to develop children’s curiosity, creativity and physical play and to encourage respect for the wider world and its resources. Teachers value relationships with parents and whānau. The centre has significantly developed the way it shows its value for te reo and tikanga Māori and engages well with its Māori whānau and wider community.</p><p>There is flexibility within the programme so that children’s changing interests can be readily responded to. Teachers put much time and effort into creating new resources and activities of interest to help engage the children in focused conversations and experiences for learning. They share information with each other about each child so that their planning is based on meaningful activities of interest. As a result, children develop a range of skills, including exploration and communication skills from the many well-planned choices of free activity and small group experiences.</p><p>Children’s strengths, interests, friendships and what learning is happening for them are quickly noticed and followed up on. This includes broadening their learning about Aotearoa/New Zealand, the world and people around them.</p><p>Teachers know the children well. ERO observed teachers skilfully engaging children in in-depth conversations that extend oral language and thinking skills. This includes ably using te reo Māori and literacy and numeracy in children’s play and interactions.</p><p>Children are well supported as they move to and from the centre. Children in the process of moving to the centre from the Infants and Toddlers Centre are encouraged to develop confidence and independence skills. How well these skills are supported across the two centres may be a useful shared focus for review.</p><p>Teachers’ increased use of eFolios has given them greater flexibility for managing their own work and increased the level of involvement of parents in their child’s learning.</p><p>The centre managers have placed a strong emphasis on developing the centre’s bicultural practices. They have carried out a very useful self review that has strengthened the centre’s relationship with Māori whānau. A well-developed framework and systems support the centre’s operation and long-term planning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>A next step for the centre is to continue to develop how teachers plan for and assess each child’s learning. Teachers need to show continuity of learning for children in the many stories of learning written in children’s profiles and/or in teacher planning. Centre leaders and teachers need to show the difference teachers make to children’s learning, for example, by evaluating the effectiveness of the programmes and activities provided and the teaching and learning strategies used.</p><p>The next step for managers is to improve the focus across the centre for achieving the centre goals. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>ensuring long term strategic planning has a stronger focus on children, particularly children’s learning and development</li>
<li>providing regular, ongoing written feedback to teachers and support to help meet the centre's goals and shared expectations for high quality</li>
<li>implementing a more rigorous review of centre policies.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of St Clair Corner Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.</p><p>In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of St Clair Corner Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>23 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
