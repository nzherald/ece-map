</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Awamutu Montessori Ltd is a privately owned centre that opened in 2014. It is located in the township of Te Awamutu alongside Pekerau Primary School. It is a purpose-built centre operating two age group classrooms with a spacious shared outdoor play area. The centre operates from 8.30am to 3.30pm daily and is licensed for up to 50 children over two years of age.</p><p>The head teacher is one of the joint owners, and maintains responsibility for the leadership and daily operations of the centre. She is experienced and qualified in early childhood and Montessori education. She is well supported by a collaborative team of qualified staff and an office manager.</p><p>Since the centre opened considerable progress has been made in developing the learning environment, self-review systems, and establishing assessment and planning practices. Teachers have had access to relevant professional development including specific training in the delivery of the Montessori curriculum.</p><p>Teachers have developed a shared understanding and approach to education. The centre philosophy is guided by the theories of Maria Montessori and the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Children are provided with access to carefully maintained and ordered classrooms with specialised equipment. The curriculum promotes peaceful and respectful learning environments.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from trusting, respectful and warm relationships with adults and their peers. Their emotional and physical well-being is nurtured by teachers who know them well and are responsive to individual children’s feelings and needs. Children’s transitions into, within and from the centre are sensitively managed in partnership with parents. Teachers place high priority on establishing and maintaining positive relationships with parents and making them feel welcome in the centre. Regular informal and formal communication ensures parents are well informed and invited to be involved in their child’s education and care.</p><p>Children’s social and communication skills are actively encouraged through opportunities to take on authentic responsibilities for themselves, others and in daily routines. Children develop friendships and enjoy many positive interactions with and alongside others. The curriculum also provides children with rich learning opportunities in the main areas of literacy, mathematics, creative arts, cultural studies and sensorial experiences. The programme is enriched through excursions into the community and visitors to the centre.</p><p>Children’s independence is fostered by being able to explore and engage with high quality resources for sustained periods of uninterrupted time. A strength of the centre is the ongoing access to the well-presented outside play area. Teachers model calm, unhurried interactions with children. Effective teaching strategies encourage children to solve problems and to extend their ideas and understandings. High levels of rich oral language are evident in learning conversations between adults and children.</p><p>Teachers view children as capable self-managing learners, who learn in the context of practical life experiences, with real-life resources. Through careful observations teachers recognise children’s interests, strengths and learning dispositions. They make effective use of this information to respond to teachable moments and develop individual plans with next steps for ongoing learning. Teachers have established attractively presented high quality profiles that celebrate and record children’s learning over time. These are valued, regularly accessed, and revisited by children and their families.</p><p>The head teacher has high expectations for teachers’ practice and implementation of the Montessori approach to education. Teachers have clear guidelines and expectations for teaching practice and centre operations. Regular planning meetings enable teachers to effectively share information about children, and plan collaboratively to appropriately extend individuals’ learning.</p><p>The head teacher and staff have worked hard to put in place sound systems for reviewing the quality of centre operations, the quality of education and the learning environment. A good framework for appraisal has been recently documented to support teachers’ ongoing professional practice, and the head teacher recognises the importance of fully implementing the newly developed appraisal processes for all staff. Ongoing teacher reflection and inquiry based self-review practices focus on positive outcomes for children and ongoing centre improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers are currently undertaking planned self review with a focus on centre development and improvement. ERO agrees this current self-review focus should support positive outcomes for children. This review has identified the following next steps:</p><ul>
<li>Teachers should continue to develop practices that promote awareness and understanding of Māori culture, language and identity.</li>
<li>The head teacher should continue to support teachers to make the most effective use of Montessori equipment by developing their awareness of the intended learning potential of these resources.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Awamutu Montessori Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Awamutu Montessori Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>21 July 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
