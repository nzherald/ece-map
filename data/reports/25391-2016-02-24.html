</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Childrens Corner is located in Papatoetoe. The centre occupies two converted houses, one of which is for children under two years of age and the other for children from two to six years of age. It offers all day care and education for 50 children, including up to 15 children under two years of age.</p><p>The centre philosophy was recently reviewed by all teaching staff. The philosophy recognises the importance of a child-centred and play-based approach to learning and development, and partnerships with parents and whānau. It also continues to acknowledge the importance of Te Tiriti o Waitangi as well as the diverse cultural backgrounds of many of the children who attend. Most of the children are of Māori, Pacific or Indian descent.</p><p>This is the second ERO review of this privately owned centre. One of the owners continues to work in the centre weekly to manage financial, property and broader governance responsibilities. A new centre manager has been appointed in the last five months. In October 2015, a new teacher joined the teaching team in the under three area.</p><p>The centre manager's role is the day-to-day management of the centre, leadership of the teaching team, and programme development. The centre has two fully registered and three provisionally registered teachers.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report identified three areas of non-compliance. These related to the quality of the educational programme, self review and teaching practice. In June 2015, staff worked with an external facilitator to develop an action plan to address the non-compliance matters and areas for development identified in the 2013 ERO report. Good progress has been made to improve the quality of the educational programme and teaching practices. Self review is in the early stages of development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and settled in the centre. They are supported to be independent learners. Children have many opportunities for uninterrupted play. They work well in groups and are often able to sustain play for prolonged periods. They have a lot of fun and enjoy the opportunities for exploration and creativity. Children's voice is valued and they have a strong sense of belonging. Children with special learning needs are well supported.</p><p>Teachers provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for children and their families. They have positive and caring relationships with children, families and each other. Interactions are frequent and teachers support children well. Some teachers use te reo Māori incidentally in their interactions with children. Adults’ respectful conversations acknowledge children's competence and empower them to make their own decisions. Infants and toddlers are provided with a safe and secure environment, and teachers' main focus is on encouraging children's communication and exploration.</p><p>Teachers plan collaboratively and are responsive to children's interests. Recent refinements to planning have strengthened teachers' focus on noticing, recognising and responding to children's individual interests and strengths. The principles and goals of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum underpin and guide the curriculum. Teachers plan deliberately to integrate early literacy and mathematics concepts into the context of children's play. This is a deliberate focus to support the four year olds to transition more successfully to school.</p><p>Teachers integrate biculturalism and aspects of tikanga Māori into the programme and would like to continue to strengthen this in the centre. Portfolios show the development of each child's knowledge, skills and dispositions over time. The centre manager would like to continue to build consistency in the documentation and analysis of children's learning.</p><p>Parent involvement and participation in children's learning is encouraged and valued. Teachers provide a range of opportunities for parents to participate in the programme, share their aspirations and be aware of their child’s progress. Parents are pleased with the positive changes to the indoor and outdoor learning environments. The centre manager has identified the need to continue to increase parent contributions to children's learning and the curriculum.</p><p>The centre manager's decision making and improvements are all focused on improving outcomes for children. She is effectively building a cohesive and collaborative team. Teachers' leadership skills and areas of expertise are valued. Teachers spoke enthusiastically about the leader's positivity, passion for the work, and care. They are also proud of the changes and improvements to programme planning and the physical learning environment.</p><p>The centre owners have established a sound policy framework. Policies are visible in practice and are regularly reviewed. Self review is in the beginning stages and the centre owners and manager should continue to strengthen this in the centre. Strategic planning is in the beginning stages. The next steps are to develop a strategic plan that is more long term, and then each year develop an annual plan to implement chosen aspects of the strategic plan. The owner and centre manager would like to work collaboratively to continue to strengthen strategic planning and self-review.</p><p>Following a recent personnel management issue the centre owners appropriately plan to conduct a review of all governance and management systems in order to improve them and to ensure that they effectively promote the wellbeing of children and adults in the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO recommends and centre leaders agree that key next steps should include:</p><ul>
<li>increased celebration and integration of cultures in the curriculum</li>
<li>more use of teaching strategies that extend children's learning and engage them in more complex play</li>
<li>ensuring that teachers are provided with relevant professional learning and development to grow their professional practice</li>
<li>reviewing all governance and management systems, including personnel policies and procedures, including the appraisal system, to ensure that these are effective and meet legislative requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Childrens Corner Papatoetoe completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the review, ERO identified areas of non-compliance. The service provider must</p><ul>
<li>implement suitable personnel management policies and practices</li>
<li>regularly review all aspects of centre operation</li>
<li>ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to promote the wellbeing of children and adults in the service.</li>

ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
