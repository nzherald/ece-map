<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The centre is well placed to promote children's wellbeing. A greater focus on improving the quality of teaching will help the centre to be better placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The Valley Kindergarten provides all day care and education service to children over two years of age. The service is privately owned and operated, and opened in January 2012. The spacious, indoor area has been purpose built to enable all children to learn and play together.</p><p>All teaching staff are fully registered. Teachers work collaboratively as a team, and have remained together since the centre opened.</p><p>This is the first ERO report for The Valley Kindergarten.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children respond positively to the warm, welcoming teachers and to each other. These affirming relationships help children to learn to relate to other children and to adults. The head teacher gives priority to building positive relationships. As a result, the programme includes a planned project on friendships that includes children, wh&#257;nau and staff. Children demonstrate inclusive and accepting attitudes to others.</p><p>Children play well with what is provided for them. Children&rsquo;s play would be enriched by improvements to the centre layout and better access to resources that stimulate more imaginative and creative play. The owners have plans in place to increase resources appropriate for each age group. Resources also need to be more reflective of the cultures of the children at the centre.</p><p>Music and movement feature prominently in the curriculum. Children particularly enjoy singing and playing musical instruments. This reflects the teachers&rsquo; interests and strengths and is also responsive to the cultural diversity of teachers and children.</p><p>Some teachers engage children well in conversations about their learning and their home lives. This helps children to make connections between home and the centre and supports children&rsquo;s developing language and growth as learners. All teachers could now build their skill in developing discussions with children that help them to deepen their thinking and reasoning.</p><p>The owners and ERO agree that improvements to the quality of teaching in the centre would enhance outcomes for children. They are committed to sourcing appropriate professional learning and development for teachers. Teachers&rsquo; appraisals, once implemented, should provide a useful tool for gauging how well staff are meeting criteria for good teaching practice. Professional learning and development could be targeted to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen teacher knowledge of good early childhood education practice, curriculum and theories</li>
<li>help teachers to plan effective programmes for individuals and groups of children.</li>
</ul><p>The owners are well organised. They have established a useful policy base and good systems to ensure that requirements are being met. Despite only being open for a year, the owners have strategic plans in place to guide the centre in achieving its reviewed mission statement.</p><p>Self review is established and could now be more rigorous to promote improvements.</p><p>The head teacher leads staff in individual and collective reflection on centre programmes and practices. This practice is positive and could be strengthened by identifying the teaching practices that need to be improved and how to achieve these improvements.</p><p>For the next philosophy review the owners and staff should include consideration of how the goals and principles of the Treaty of Waitangi will be met in the centre, and strengthen ways that the programme reflects the bicultural heritage of New Zealand.</p><p>The owners plan to seek and respond more specifically to parents&rsquo; goals and aspirations for their children&rsquo;s education.</p><p>Centre owners and teachers continue to support M&#257;ori children to achieve success as M&#257;ori.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>The owners and ERO agrees that they need to secure professional development to improve the quality of teaching and learning.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Valley Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>20 March 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
