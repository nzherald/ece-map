</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Whānui Early Learning Centre operates under the umbrella of the Waahi Whaanui Trust, which is an iwi service provider that operates under the auspices of the Kīngitanga. It provides social, health and environmental services for six marae in the wider Huntly area. It is located on the western side of the Waikato river in Huntly. The centre is licensed for 30 children including up to five under the age of two. At the time of the review it operated a six hour service from 8.30am – 2.30pm daily. In line with the concepts of tuakana/teina and whanaungatanga babies, toddlers and young children learn and play together. All children are Māori and most whakapapa to one of the six marae served by the trust.</p><p>The centre is closely aligned with the Kīngitanga and clearly supports Kīngitanga kaupapa such as 'Māku anō e hanga tōku nei whare' in the way it fosters and supports the development of local children and teachers. The centre also supports the vision of its umbrella organisation, 'Mānaakitia te iwi – To serve the people'. The centre philosophy is clearly stated and well supported by staff and whānau. It promotes respect for individual children within a kaupapa Māori framework.</p><p>The centre is led by a qualified and registered teacher, supported by a newly qualified teacher who is an experienced member of staff. The remaining members of staff have experience in the centre and bring useful skills and knowledge to the programme. All staff are committed to children’s wellbeing and development.</p><p>The 2010 ERO report recognised the centre’s strengths in engaging parents and whānau and in developing children’s confidence and their strong sense of belonging in the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are involved in interesting and active play. Their exploration of the environment is well supported by teachers. Children participate confidently, relate well together and have fun. Older children are very aware of the younger children and are generally protective and loving. Te reo Māori and tikanga are integrated, particularly through waiata and karakia, and children are learning to share their pepeha with teachers and their peers. Children know the centre routines well and enjoy shared meal times which are whānau and social occasions.</p><p>Teachers respond to the strengths and interests of children and record each child’s ongoing participation and learning in individual portfolios. Parents and whānau are encouraged to share information about their children’s home experiences. In addition there are many opportunities for them to share their aspirations for their children. This information is shared among teachers and contributes to effective interactions with children. Teachers are developing individual portfolios further to more clearly show children’s growing understandings over time. They are also considering how to include a bicultural perspective that more strongly reflects and reinforces children’s identity as Māori. Portfolios are readily available for parents to read and share with children and whānau.</p><p>Parents and whānau are welcome in the centre. There are many opportunities for them to become involved in the centre activities. These include monthly whānau hui and a variety of celebrations such as children’s birthdays, Matariki, concerts and meet and greet evenings. At these times parents and whānau can talk with teachers, view the portfolios and ask questions about the programme.</p><p>The centre environment provides many learning opportunities both indoors and in the playground. The centre staff are seeking to improve the range of equipment and resources available in order to sustain children's interests and create further challenges. Teachers listen and respond to children and this supports their oral language and communication skills.</p><p>Teachers are beginning to use local landmarks, history and environmental issues as resources to develop a stronger kaupapa Māori curriculum. For example, children enjoy exploring the banks of the Waikato River and learning about river restoration projects. This aspect of the centre is closely aligned with other Waahi Whaanui Trust activity and deepens children’s understanding of the significance of the local environment to their history and identity.</p><p>Teachers have undertaken an effective programme of centre-wide professional learning and development which has raised their awareness of the importance of programme evaluation and self review. The teaching team is now in a good position to use planned, long-term self review to identify priorities for centre improvement. Self review could also be used to develop a strategic plan to guide the long-term development of the service to meet changing needs and circumstances.</p><p>Centre leaders show a strong commitment to the goals and philosophy of the service. The team leader has established professional support networks and uses guidance and mentoring processes to build the capacity of other staff. He also works with staff to develop their confidence and encourage emergent leadership.</p><p>The Waahi Whaanui organisation provides sound policy and procedural guidelines in the areas of finance, property and employment. The performance management process has supported teacher development. Consideration is being given to including aspects of the Registered Teacher Criteria to enhance the emphasis on best practice in teaching.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre management agree that outcomes for children can be further enhanced by:</p><ul>
<li>re establishing a programme planning process that displays and documents intended teaching strategies to support children’s interests and extending learning</li>
<li>completing a strategic plan that identifies centre development priorities. This needs to be linked to the outcomes of curriculum self review, centre operations and teacher development</li>
<li>involving centre leadership in setting the annual budget to allow for planned expenditure that clearly reflects centre needs and priorities</li>
<li>establishing an appropriate process for appraising the team leader.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Whanui Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Whanui Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>30 October 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
