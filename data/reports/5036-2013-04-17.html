<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Botany Downs Kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Botany Downs Kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association. The Association provides policy, procedures and guidelines to support the operation of the service. It also provides teachers with regular, topical professional development and visits from professional support managers.</p><p>The well designed learning environment is purposeful and welcoming to parents and children. Respectful relationships are a strong feature in the kindergarten. Parents, children and teachers have a strong sense of belonging to the kindergarten community. Ongoing friendships and positive relationships continue over time. The kindergarten is a valued part of the community.</p><p>The service is in the process of changing to the kindergarten day model (KDM) of operation. Families now have a choice of children attending half-day or full-day programmes. Teachers are making adjustments to routines and considering how they can use the changes to benefit children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in six early childhood education services within the Auckland Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers know children well and are establishing sound learning partnerships with them. Children are viewed as capable, independent learners. Their emerging individual interests are often extended into long-term projects. Teachers and children research ideas together to deepen their understanding of particular topics. Children are articulate, focused learners who solve problems and work collaboratively.</p><p>The kindergarten provides a positive learning environment for all. The head teacher provides inclusive leadership and models a commitment to learning through her own professional development. Teachers work well together, sharing roles and responsibilities. Teacher aides provide valuable support for children with specific learning needs. Children, parents and staff encourage one another to develop as leaders and learners.</p><p>Teachers consistently review their teaching practices and the quality of the curriculum. Regular participation in professional development helps them to challenge their own learning and provide enriched learning experiences for children that are particularly evident in literacy, numeracy and basic te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori. Inviting learning environments stimulate children&rsquo;s curiosity and encourage exploration. Many opportunities are provided to help children continue to develop physical, social, creative and thinking skills.</p><p>Sound management practices are in place. Appraisal procedures are linked to the registered teacher criteria. A kindergarten blog informs parents and wh&#257;nau about their children&rsquo;s learning. High levels of team work exist between teachers and parent committee members. Parents are involved in decision-making about the future direction of the kindergarten. Strategic planning is strongly linked to the kindergarten&rsquo;s child-focused philosophy.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that teachers could further strengthen teaching and learning by:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to adapt the kindergarten&rsquo;s curriculum and routines to provide best learning opportunities for children within the KDM structure</li>
<li>promoting higher learning outcomes for M&#257;ori children by linking appraisal goals to the Ministry of Education guideline, <em>Tataiako</em>.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Botany Downs Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>17 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
