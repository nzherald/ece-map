</table><p>Linwood Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Linwood Playcentre operates as a parent cooperative under the governance and management of the Playcentre Federation, Upper South Island Region. This centre is licensed for up to 25 children, including 10 children aged under two. The centre is open three mornings a week. Woolston Playcentre holds sessions on the other two mornings while they wait for a new centre to be built.</p><p>The playcentre employs a coordinator. Parents are rostered to help at each session. The Upper South Island Region employs a centre support person and an administrator who regularly visit the playcentre to support the parents and coordinator.</p><p>The centre's philosophy places strong emphasis on the important role of parents in their children's learning and wellbeing. Respect for and use of te reo and tikanga Māori is promoted, and children's home cultures are similarly valued and respected. The philosophy states that the learning environment is to be inclusive, rich and sustainable. Adults are encouraged to learn alongside their children and participate in the parent education courses offered by the Playcentre Federation.</p><p>With support from the Upper South Island Regional Hub, the centre's adults have made good progress in many areas to address the recommendations identified in the 2014 ERO report. Internal evaluation is now well understood and used. Progress and outcomes related to strategic goals need to be better documented. Adults also need to improve the documentation of children's goals, progress and learning outcomes in assessment and programme planning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six playcentre reviews in the Playcentre Federation, Upper South Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled, friendly and engaged in meaningful learning. Adults skilfully use their knowledge of each child and their interests to provide activities that help children extend their interests and knowledge. Children confidently discuss their learning and request support.</p><p>Children and adults are warmly welcomed and respected for the skills and interests they bring and share. The centre is inclusive of all cultures and families. Children are well supported by all adults who show a genuine interest in their wellbeing and learning. Adults work collaboratively to care for babies. Children are valued as individuals and members of the playcentre. Parents enjoy a positive and relaxed environment where they are well supported in their parenting role.</p><p>Te reo and tikanga Māori are well integrated into all aspects of the programme and centre operations. Māori children are well supported to succeed as Māori and be proud of New Zealand's bicultural heritage. Knowledgeable and highly skilled adults willingly share te reo and te ao Māori in ways that are meaningful and accepting of genuine efforts to learn and participate. Children and adults are actively involved in the bicultural programme, take pride in their progress and willingly share it with others.</p><p>The local curriculum is clearly evident in the well-resourced and easy-to-access learning environment. Adults provide good support for children to follow their interests and lead their learning. Sustainability and the provision of a natural learning environment that incorporates strong Māori values, are thoughtfully embedded and are a feature of the playcentre. Children know about and value their food sources, and enjoy eating and cooking their own home grown vegetables and fruit. The natural environment successfully promotes imaginative play and creativity.</p><p>All adults are purposefully involved in assessment and planning for all children. Detailed records are kept of children's interests, involvement in the programme and activity extensions. Te Whāriki (2017), the NZ Early Childhood Curriculum, has been used well in this process to help adults:</p><ul>
<li>identify children's interests</li>
<li>make links to Te Whāriki (2017) strands and goals</li>
<li>understand the bicultural nature of the curriculum document.</li>
</ul><p>The strategic plan and internal evaluation processes have been used appropriately by the parent cooperative to provide direction for the centre, show progress and identify what needs to happen next. A stronger focus on parents' aspirations and valued outcomes for children should enable the adults to know more about the effectiveness of the implementation of their plans and strategies.</p><p>The centre parents and coordinator are well supported by the Upper South Island Region. The playcentre operates effectively as a parent cooperative.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The parent cooperative and ERO confirms that the key next steps are to extend:</p><ul>
<li>assessment and planning documentation to include parents' aspirations, show the learning occurring for children, their progress and the learning outcomes</li>
<li>strategic planning and internal evaluation to include and identify valued outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Upper South Island Regional Governance</h3><p>There continues to be significant change occurring with the playcentre's governance and management at regional and federation levels.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Linwood Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>30 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
