</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Speckled Frog Preschool is a privately owned early learning service. It is licensed for 27 children, including 15 aged up to two years. The owner/manager oversees the day-to-day operation of the centre. A manager is responsible for curriculum and teacher development. Team leaders oversee the two separate learning areas.</p><p>Since the January 2016 ERO report, there have been some staff changes. The owner is currently in the process of building another early childhood centre at a different site.</p><p>The previous ERO review report identified a number of key next steps in relation to: assessment, planning and evaluation; success for Māori; staff appraisals; children's transitions; internal evaluation; and aspects of the curriculum. The centre has made some progress in addressing these, however, further development is needed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Aspects of the centre's philosophy are evident in practice. Children are engaged in a programme based on their interests. Parents and whānau are warmly welcomed. Children participate enthusiastically in a range of learning experiences. They work well together problem solving, taking risks and having fun. A recent focus on sustainability is supporting them to learn about their role in looking after the environment.</p><p>Teachers ensure a calm, slow pace in which younger children have the space and time they need to engage in learning. Communication books provide useful links between home and the centre, supporting their care routines and daily needs.</p><p>Teachers work with a range of external agencies to assist children who require additional learning support to achieve their goals. There has been a deliberate focus on developing strategies to support these children's transition pathways.</p><p>Children do not have a curriculum that maintains connection to their culture, language and identity. Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are apparent but are not embedded in practice. Teachers have identified that strengthening understanding of educational success for Māori is an important next step for them. This was an area for development in ERO's 2014 and 2016 reports.</p><p>A variable approach to planning for learning is in place. Centre leaders have identified a need to develop the quality of teachers’ approach to assessment, planning and evaluation of children’s learning. Creating a coordinated and consistent approach that is responsive to individual children, is a key next step. This includes the development of clear expectations to guide teacher practice. This was a finding in the January 2016 ERO report.</p><p>Support for teacher's development needs strengthening. The improvements evident in the previous ERO report have not been sustained. The appraisal process does not yet follow Education Council guidelines. Urgency is required to implement an approach that includes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the setting of meaningful development goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>observations of teacher practice and useful feedback about next steps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>documentation of appraisal meetings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>guidelines to support implementation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tracking and monitoring of teaching practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Internal evaluation is in the early stages of implementation. This has been an ongoing area for improvement in previous ERO reports. Teachers should continue to strengthen their knowledge and understanding of inquiry and evaluation. This should help them to monitor the effectiveness of centre operation and practice and guide decision-making about change.</p><p>Clearer guidelines and expectations about practice are required to strengthen governance. A management assurance process that monitors the quality and implementation of policies and procedures, and compliance with legislative requirements should be put in place.</p><p>Leaders and ERO agree that the priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further develop consistent assessment, planning and evaluation practices that respond to the learning needs of individuals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the bicultural curriculum and teachers' knowledge and understanding of educational success for Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve the appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop shared understanding and use of internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen knowledge and understanding of mandatory regulatory requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement an effective quality assurance process.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Speckled Frog Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service relating to governance, and health and safety. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen record keeping in relation to appraisal, excursions, medication, earthquake drills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that documentation essential to centre operation is kept to meet regulatory requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure suitable resource management practices are implemented, including appraisal.<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS17, HS28, HS8, and GMA 7]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Speckled Frog Preschool. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Speckled Frog Preschool will be in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services <span>Southern Region</span></p><p>18 December 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/#return times" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
