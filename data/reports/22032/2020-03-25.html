</table><p>Titirangi Playcentre is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Titirangi Playcentre is operated collaboratively by parents/whānau for their children and is open for five sessions each week. The centre is licensed for 30 children, including up to 15 children under two years of age. Centre members are both local and from more outlying areas.</p><p>Centre practices are based on the Playcentre philosophy of families learning and growing together. Sessions are guided by <em><span lang="mi">Te</span></em> <em>Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and a commitment to <span lang="mi">Te Tiriti o Waitangi</span>. Some children remain at the centre until they transition to school.</p><p>Centre members have sustained good practices identified in the 2015 ERO review. They responded well to the key next steps identified, such as planning, assessment and evaluation, and developing a bicultural curriculum. Centre members have good training levels. Eight members have achieved a Course 3 qualification.</p><p>The new Playcentre Aotearoa structure is now fully operational. It provides a sound management framework and support personnel to help parents/whānau to manage their centres. Playcentre Aotearoa administers centres’ funding and provides adult education programmes for parents/whānau to achieve Playcentre qualifications.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the Playcentre Aotearoa Auckland region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy a wide variety of learning experiences that encourage them to be confident inquirers and physically active. They participate in meaningful, sustained and purposeful play and are happy and confident. Children have many opportunities for physical challenge and to explore the creative spaces in the centre's learning environments.</p><p>Adults' interactions with children are respectful. They take time to listen to children and encourage them to take responsibility for themselves and others. <span lang="mi">Tuakana/teina</span> relationships are a strong feature in the centre.</p><p>Parents/whānau plan programmes for children that promote children's dispositions for learning and respond very effectively to their interests, strengths and identified next learning steps. Well-presented portfolios are valuable records of individual children's learning. More experienced centre members help new parents/whānau to build their knowledge about recording children’s learning and to develop their capability in planning, assessment and evaluation of learning.</p><p>Centre members work with each other to promote engagement in their children's learning and centre operations. Systems, processes and regular open communication support members to implement high quality practices. Leaders are good stewards of the Playcentre philosophy and provide positive support and leadership for new members.</p><p>Adults and children use <span lang="mi">te reo</span> and <span lang="mi">tikanga</span> Māori well in sessions. Parents/whānau are continuing to build their knowledge, capability and confidence in bicultural practices.</p><p>Centre members have adopted planned approaches to implementing the Playcentre Aotearoa policy framework. The strategic plan, annual plan and <em><span lang="mi">Te Whāriki</span></em> guide the future direction of the centre. Internal evaluation is focused on positive outcomes for children and the ongoing sustainability of the centre. There is a culture of regular internal evaluation that is well embedded and promotes a thoughtful approach to new developments and problem solving.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To enhance existing quality practices, key next steps for centre members include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening bicultural practices to support children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making displays of children's artwork and learning portfolios more accessible for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to engage new members in Playcentre adult education programmes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Key next steps for development in the Playcentre Aotearoa Auckland region include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening the use of internal evaluation to measure the effectiveness of systems and practices across the region.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Titirangi Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>25 March 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
