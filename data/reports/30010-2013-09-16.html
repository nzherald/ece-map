</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Walton Playcentre is located in a rural setting, near Matamata, in the grounds of Walton School. It provides two sessions a week of education and care for a maximum of 26 children, including up to 10 under two years. The centre continues to maintain close links with the neighbouring school.</p><p>The centre is a parent cooperative and operates under the umbrella of the East Waikato Playcentre Association. It has been relicensed by the Ministry of Education under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>. After a period of significant membership change, there is now a small core group of enthusiastic parents who share responsibility for centre roles and have completed initial playcentre training. The association employs a session coordinator who has higher levels of playcentre training to enable both sessions to meet funding requirements.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history. Since the 2010 ERO review, parents have made some progress in clarifying the purpose of individual children’s portfolios and documenting children’s participation in the programme. As identified in the 2010 ER0 report, there continues to be a need for the association to review the extent and availability of support for centre members.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy is for parents to facilitate and extend their children’s learning and play.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 playcentre reviews in the East Waikato Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A core group of enthusiastic parents takes collective responsibility for centre management. Parent members have benefited from association training about their roles, and association support with the relicensing process. These parents have made good use of their own knowledge and experience to develop a strategic plan and determine centre priorities. They use an effective combination of formal and informal review to make decisions about ongoing improvement and development.</p><p>Members place a strong emphasis on welcoming new parents and fostering emergent leadership. They respond with flexibility, empathy and understanding to the unique needs of rural families. A next step for centre leaders is to identify desired outcomes for self reviews and how they might evaluate their effectiveness. ERO agrees with centre members about the need to further review and upgrade learning environments, including the outdoor environment.</p><p>The centre programme is responsive to children’s interests and includes a wide variety of adult-initiated activities designed to extend children’s learning. These activities include trips to places of interest, celebrations and seasonal activities. Children’s learning and participation in the programme is well documented in individual learning books, wall displays and centre activity books. Children enjoy revisiting their learning and sharing this with other children and adults. They also have many opportunities to develop early literacy and mathematical concepts and a love of books. Adults also encourage children to explore aspects of natural science and to develop observation skills. Centre members and ERO agree that a next step would be to further incorporate aspects of Māori language and culture. This should extend children’s understanding and appreciation of Aotearoa/New Zealand as a bicultural society.</p><p>Adults’ interactions and relationships with children are respectful, responsive and affirming. Parents use rich language in conversations to extend children’s thinking. These conversations support children to become capable and confident communicators. Parents work alongside children at their level and make effective use of humour, singing and modelling as teaching strategies. The curriculum and parent interactions foster children’s independence and promote exploration and experimentation. Children bring their knowledge of farming life to their play and adults make strong links to home, integrating this into the life of the centre.</p><p>Policies and procedures developed by the association contribute to the effective operation of the service. Members are keen to continue their training when the association re-establishes training and courses in their area. As part of this review, ERO evaluated the effectiveness of the centre’s responsibilities for employment and management of staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The association implemented effective procedures when employing the session coordinator. A next step is to strengthen appraisal processes by including clear indicators for quality practice for playcentre education. Regular feedback and guidance from a suitably experienced and knowledgeable appraiser will assist the implementation of these processes. Parents have also identified the need to review the session coordinator’s job description to reflect the centre’s changing needs and priorities.</p><p>Centre sustainability would be enhanced with a strengthening of association support for members, such as regular visits and constructive feedback and advice from well-informed association personnel.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Walton Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Walton Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>16 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
