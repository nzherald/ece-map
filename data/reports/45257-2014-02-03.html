<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Home from Home Family Childcare Limited is a small home-based network that operates in the Rodney district. This organisation caters for children from infants to school age and provides education and care by educarers in their own homes.</p><p>The network is managed by the owner, who has had long-term involvement in home-based education and care prior to starting her own service. The owner and another staff member work as visiting teachers and provide regular support to educarers. This is the service&rsquo;s first ERO review.</p><p>The service provides positive outcomes for children and their families. Children are happy and settled and have a strong sense of belonging in educarer homes. Respectful caring relationships are a feature of the service. Parents are kept informed about their children&rsquo;s progress.</p><p>Educarers provide learning through planned activities, spontaneous events and excursions. Children have opportunities to socialise with and learn alongside other children. Educarers interact positively with children and frequently engage them in conversation. The service provides playgroups for group learning as well as additional resources for educarers to help meet the care and learning needs of children.</p><p>The service is currently establishing some effective management and administration systems to support its further development. The owner is aware of the need to improve self review, strategic planning and some aspects of financial management. Professional development would assist the centre to make improvements in these areas. Visiting teachers could increase support for educarers to strengthen existing programme planning practices and further improve the quality of its home-based care and education.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Home from Home Family Childcare Limited has been operating in the wider Rodney area since November 2009. The service is coordinated by the owner and one other visiting teacher. Both have had long-term background experience in home-based care and are qualified early childhood educators. An administrator manages office systems and helps to maintain communication between the organisation and families. The organisation provides regular visits and professional support to 19 educarers, who provide education programmes and care for children in their own homes.</p><h3>Areas of good performance</h3><p>Children benefit from supportive and caring relationships in educarers' homes. Educarers know children well and are responsive to their physical, social and emotional needs. Children show a strong sense of belonging and a family-like connection to one another. Educarers appreciate the support they receive from educators. Parents comment favourably on the service and the care their children receive.</p><p>Educarers provide good quality care and view children&rsquo;s wellbeing as a priority. Careful consideration is given to ensuring a good match between educarers and children. Programmes operate at the children&rsquo;s pace and routines are flexible and personalised. Home environments are well resourced and provide good opportunities for a range of engaging play activities. Educarers maintain good hygiene practices and are supported by regular health and safety checks conducted by a visiting teacher.</p><p>A varied range of additional learning opportunities complements home-centred learning. Most educators involve children in larger groups and excursions outside the home. They participate in community and home-based playgroups and other events organised by the service. Visiting teachers are aware they could increase the focus of biculturalism within the programmes.</p><p>Visiting teachers provide individualised guidance and support for families, children and educarers. Visits to the homes are recorded and shared with families. Visiting teachers give educarers autonomy to develop programmes for children and model the writing of learning stories.</p><p>The owner has established some effective management practices. There is good communication between visiting teachers and educarers. Training is provided to enhance the programmes educarers provide for children.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>ERO, the owner and service managers agree that next steps for improving the service should include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening the evaluative aspects of self review</li>
<li>developing strategic and annual planning</li>
<li>reviewing policies to ensure they are clear, easily understood and promote high quality home-based care and education</li>
<li>continuing to develop appraisal systems that will grow the leadership capability of management staff</li>
<li>strengthening support for educarers to develop their planning and assessment about the learning of individual children</li>
<li>increasing educarers' knowledge about te reo me &#333;na tikanga M&#257;ori.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Home from Home Family Childcare completed an <em>ERO Home-Based Education</em> and <em>Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>3 February 2014</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>
