</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Swinburn House in Napier is a community-based early childhood centre operating under the umbrella of Birthright Hawke's Bay Child and Family Care Trust (Birthright) who are responsible for the governance of this service. The centre works alongside a range of community agencies to support the diverse needs of children and families. Māori children make up two thirds of enrolments. A van is accessed by families who require transport for their children to attend the centre.</p><p>The service is licensed for 37 children including provision for one child up to two years. A second centre, Tom Parker House, operates for children up to two years of age. Many children transition from this centre to Swinburn House.</p><p>The March 2016 ERO report identified a number of areas for improvement. These included: developments in assessment, planning and evaluation; philosophy, teacher appraisal reflections; te ao Māori; and governance and management systems. The Ministry of Education has provided targeted support for improvement to build capacity.</p><p>Significant progress has been made by management to improve service-wide systems and processes that contribute to successful outcomes for children.</p><p>A newly appointed head teacher is developing her management role with the support of the new chief executive officer of Birthright who has been managing the centre through a period of change.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy reflects whānau and teachers' shared values and beliefs. Further refinement is being undertaken to reflect the priorities for children's learning: whanaungatanga; self-regulation; success for Māori children as Māori; and literacy.</p><p>Children's ownership of the environment and sense of wellbeing are strongly evident. Their independence and self-management skills are actively promoted. Teachers use effective strategies to encourage their language development, support social and emotional competencies and promote their ideas and working theories.</p><p>Changes to the indoor and outdoor environments have contributed to more open, welcoming spaces for children and whānau and increased learning opportunities. Further consideration should be given to how the environment can better support the learning outcomes for children as defined by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Leaders have identified that assessment, planning and evaluation requires further strengthening to more effectively respond to children's individual interests and needs. Priorities for children's learning have been collaboratively identified. Individual pukapuka taonga record their participation and engagement in the programme. The programme and assessment increasingly reflect these.</p><p>Teachers need to develop a shared understanding of expectations about what effective assessment looks like to show:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>planning and intentional teaching for individuals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how learning is progressed over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>responsiveness to parent aspirations and perspectives.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The teaching team is committed to the development of the bicultural programme. Leaders and teachers use te reo Māori with children and integrate te ao Māori throughout the curriculum and documentation. Leaders and teachers recognise the importance of continuing to build strong relationships with Māori families to promote Māori children's learning and success.</p><p>Teachers sensitively respond to the needs of all children within an inclusive environment. Individual learning plans are collaboratively developed in partnership with whānau and external agencies to support children with additional learning needs.</p><p>Children's sense of belonging is nurtured during transitions within the centre. Shared information and visits support children's sense of security.</p><p>A deliberate focus on growing staff leadership capability contributes to strengthened teacher collaboration and teamwork. There is a clear commitment to developing staff knowledge and skills through ongoing professional learning and the sharing of good practice. An appraisal process that supports teachers to inquire into their practice is now in place. Developing guidelines to support the collection of evidence and to evaluate the impact of teaching practice should further enhance the usefulness of this process.</p><p>A cycle of review provides leaders and teachers with a useful framework to identify areas of practice that require improvement. Leaders and ERO agree that further development of internal evaluation should assist with evaluating the effectiveness of practice to achieve the intended learning outcomes as reflected in the philosophy.</p><p>Governance has clearly defined roles and responsibilities. There is a strategic focus on improving teaching and learning. A comprehensive policy framework sets helps to guide practice and centre operation. A more targeted approach to improvement is needed and reporting to the board should assist this.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that the priorities are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning to inform and enhance the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation to support teachers to know the impact of their actions on children's outcomes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Swinburn House completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Swinburn House will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>11 July 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
