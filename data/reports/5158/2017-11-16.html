</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Glenview Kindergarten, formerly known as Shirley Muir Kindergarten, is one of 29 kindergartens located in the Waikato that operate under the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA). It is located in the Hamilton suburb of Glenview and licenced for 40 children from two years old to school age. The kindergarten offers both full-day and sessional education and care in mixed-age groups, and provides 20 free hours for children from two years old. All teachers are qualified and registered teachers. At the time of this review there were 52 children on the roll, of whom eight identify as Māori and four have Pacific heritages.</p><p>Since the 2014 ERO review, the head teacher has remained in her position and there have been changes to the teaching team. Teachers have engaged in professional development to improve assessment, bicultural practices and internal evaluation processes. There have been ongoing improvements to the indoor and outdoor play areas.</p><p>Glenview Kindergarten's philosophy is to 'offer an inviting, respectful, happy atmosphere where everyone is welcome'. There are emphases on valuing what children bring to their learning and play, and continuing to establish bicultural practices.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the WKA, which is a charitable trust, and does not operate for profit. The strategic direction of the Association is guided by the overarching statement, ‘Every child reaching their full potential’. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. All kindergartens in Waikato Kindergarten Association are involved in sustainable programmes promoting the care of people and environment, such as Enviroschools, Sport Waikato Under 5 Energise and a ‘Cool for School’ transition programme. A kaumātua from Tainui provides advice, guidance and support to the organisation. The kindergartens’ education, operational and administrative responsibilities are well supported by association specialist personnel.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six kindergartens in the Waikato Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from, responsive, reciprocal interactions in which their routines and individual preferences are respected. They enjoy learning and having fun with each other and with teachers. A positive feature of the daily programme is an emphasis on tuakana teina relationships between age groups. Younger children are readily included in the social play of their older friends. Te reo and tikanga Māori, including waiata, karakia and legends, are increasingly integrated in play and conversation. Together children play and learn in a calm, inclusive, settled atmosphere that supports them to become confident, competent learners.</p><p>Teachers effectively tune into children’s recognised interests and play to ensure that their learning is extended and enjoyable. They encourage the development of oral language and conversation skills. Literacy, mathematics, science, music and creative expression are well integrated into the free-flowing programme. There is an appropriate balance between child-led play and intentional teaching to broaden learning and challenge thinking. Children sustain engagement in a wide range of play and learning experiences.</p><p>Kindergarten environments are attractive, welcoming and well organised to stimulate learning and play. The spacious indoor area celebrates Māori language and culture, and provides well-organised spaces for children to engage in independent and group activities. Children’s work is well displayed and learning is made visible to children and parents. Readily accessed resources are appropriate for the range of age groups. The outdoor area very effectively maximises space and gives children a well-considered range of opportunities to develop social, exploration and physical skills. Children experience a sense of belonging and whanaungatanga at the kindergarten.</p><p>Collaborative programme planning is effectively informed by teachers' knowledge of children and their families. Regular assessments are shared with parents through digital programme communication, written portfolios and ongoing conversations. Children have opportunities to revisit their learning through easy access to their portfolios. Teachers are continuing to review and refine assessment processes. Transition to school is smoothly facilitated by targeted assessment and planning to address the individual learning needs of four-year-olds and providing information about local schools. Parents are included in annual summaries of children's assessments. They are well informed about children’s learning and have opportunities to contribute to the programme in action. The kindergarten's cheerful, family-like atmosphere encourages parents/whanau to participate in the programme as they are able.</p><p>The head teacher is an enthusiastic role model of professional practice and team leadership. She leads a reflective teaching team, where complementary skills and interests contribute to positive outcomes for children. The head teacher receives high-quality reports from the WKA's Education Support Manager (ESM). These provide robust and specific feedback to improve professional practice. The WKA's recently revised system for staff appraisal helps teachers to evaluate their practice in relation to annual planning goals and children's learning. Leaders and teachers continually improve the quality of education and care through systematic internal evaluation. The kindergarten team has established a very positive staff culture where professional discussions are valued and teachers engage readily in learning and development.</p><p>The WKA provides sound, comprehensive systems, policies and procedures to guide kindergarten practice. The organisation has a commitment to providing high-quality, inclusive services that meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. Teachers have access to ongoing and targeted professional development to support improved practices, and lead to improved outcomes for children. Education support managers work closely with the head teacher and provide well informed and professional leadership to support kindergarten operations.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>The key next step is to continue to strengthen programme assessment, planning and evaluation processes that contribute to children's ongoing learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Glenview Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Glenview Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>16 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
