</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bridge Street Early Learning Centre is a community-based, not-for-profit service that has contracted the Nelson Kindergarten Association (the association) for managerial, financial and professional support and guidance. The chief executive officer (CEO) of the association is the service provider. An established board made up of parent, teacher, association and management representatives meets regularly and is kept well informed of centre activities.</p><p>Bridge Street Early Learning Centre provides all-day education and care for children from six months to six years of age. It is licensed for 40 children, including 10 up to two years. It is staffed with qualified and fully registered teachers and one staff member is in training. There has been a low turnover of staff since the March 2010 report. A fundraising subcommittee is established and works in partnership to support the shared direction of the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are warm, welcoming and respectful. A well considered teaching and learning statement links to the centre’s mission, philosophy and strategic direction. The statement clearly guides teachers' support for children’s learning and wellbeing. The philosophy is evident in practice. Children’s independence is promoted and they are happy and confident in their learning. Teachers are confident in working with the strands and principles of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki.</em></p><p>Leaders, parents and teachers value the importance of partnerships. Leadership is shared and collaborative. Opportunities for children to take on leadership roles are evident throughout the day. Teachers plan a responsive curriculum and seek children’s input to decisions about the programme. Children enjoy testing their ideas in play. Teachers draw on a range of effective ways to engage them in activities for long periods of time. Children play well together and in groups of their choosing. Literacy and numeracy are well integrated in the programme. Dance, music and opportunities to explore the living world are purposefully used to extend learning.</p><p>Teachers in the Aratuna room maintain a calm slow pace that allows the infants and toddlers to lead their own learning. They are offered choice in their learning and access an environment that is well resourced and encourages exploration and physical development. There are many one-to-one interactions and responsive caregiving to support strong and secure attachments.</p><p>Te reo Māori is used by most teachers and appropriate tikanga Māori practices are included as part of the daily programme. Teachers are developing their understanding of what success for Māori as Māori, and success for Pacific as Pacific, means and are working closely with appropriate personnel to explore this further.</p><p>Children’s profile books are well presented. They highlight their participation, developing friendships and physical milestones. Teachers effectively incorporate parents’ views in their child’s learning stories.</p><p>Teachers are supported in their understanding of self review by the association. There is strong alignment between the guiding documents of the association and kindergarten and resulting review. Spontaneous and regular reviews have been used well to improve outcomes for children. Teachers and the association are highly consultative, regularly requesting and receiving feedback from their parent community. The association has effectively led robust review and evaluation using a collaborative approach.</p><p>The recently updated appraisal process is collaborative and provides clear guidance and support to staff. Leaders are engaging in ongoing professional learning in this area to assist successful implementation. ERO’s evaluation affirms this direction and recommends that the approach includes a focus on the quality of feedback and feed forward to promote teacher development.</p><p>The association provides high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning and this includes:</p><ul>
<li>clear guiding documents</li>
<li>guidance for programme delivery and centre operations, including health and safety practice</li>
<li>professional learning and development opportunities made available to centre staff.</li>
</ul><p>The association’s Senior Education Advisor (SEA) regularly visits the centre and provides professional support and leadership to the teaching team. Through SEA guidance and identified next steps, teachers are supported to enact the centre’s mission.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the documentation of how teachers show they are extending, challenging and deepening children’s learning</li>
<li>build the evaluative capacity of teachers to systematically enquire into and judge the effectiveness of their centre operations and teaching practice. This should assist future decision making and identify priorities to further enhance children’s learning and wellbeing.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bridge Street Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bridge Street Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>24 July 2013</p><h3><img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" align="left">The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
