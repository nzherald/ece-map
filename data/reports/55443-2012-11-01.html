<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Barnardos Early Learning Centre Wainui is developing its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children. The restructure of the organisation in late 2011 has resulted in effective support and communication systems to assist staff to continue to improve practice.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Barnardos Early Learning Centre Wainui provides full day education and care for children from two years old to school age. The philosophy places emphasis on supporting children&rsquo;s wellbeing, belonging, learning and exploration, and the provision of a bicultural programme. The staff reflect the diverse cultural community.</p><p>The practice leader and business manager visit regularly and provide ongoing support, professional advice and guidance, and monitoring of children&rsquo;s health and safety. Day-to-day management and responsibility for the programme is delegated to the head teacher.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are enthusiastic learners who lead the direction of the programme. They set their own goals and physical challenges and persevere to achieve these. Children play collaboratively and have good social skills. The well-resourced learning environment supports their interests and imaginative endeavours. Children&rsquo;s cultures are valued through the use of home languages in conversation and documentation. Warm, caring and responsive relationships are evident between children and teachers. Calm and gentle interactions contribute to the settled and positive atmosphere.</p><p>The programme is planned around children&rsquo;s interests, and strategies teachers will use to respond. Evaluations identify children&rsquo;s learning and the impact of the programme. Mathematical language, letter recognition activities and reading books are regularly incorporated.</p><p>While te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori are embedded in centre routines, these need to be further integrated across the programme and environment to reflect the bicultural commitment stated in the philosophy.</p><p>Strategies, resources and processes require developing to better support children and their families in the transition to primary school.</p><p>The practice leader demonstrates clear understanding of high quality early childhood education and care. Her comprehensive evidence-based reports provide staff with constructive feedback and clear expectations to guide and support practice and drive improvement. These reports specifically identify that teachers need to enhance assessment practice and programme planning. ERO findings support these directions and in addition identify that:</p><ul>
<li>teachers should participate in professional development to progress their understanding about assessment for learning, children&rsquo;s dispositions and how to use assessment to inform teaching and learning</li>
<li>the many goals set for future direction need to be prioritised so teachers can be empowered and experience success.</li>
</ul><p>A sound framework guides staff through an appropriate evaluative and research-based self review process. The appraisal system is currently being strengthened and a well-developed induction and mentoring programme supports provisionally registered teachers.</p><p>Teachers need to continue to develop their understanding and build their capacity to use self review as a tool for improving outcomes for children.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Barnardos Early Learning Centre - Wainui completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>1 November 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
