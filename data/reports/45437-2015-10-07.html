</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Centre Kidz Preschool is owned by the Paraparaumu Centre Church and administered through the Centre Education Trust. It provides a full-day early childhood education service for children aged over two years. Day-to-day management is delegated to the director. The supervisor is responsible for the development and implementation of the education programme</p><p>Four out of the five staff are registered teachers. One new teacher has been employed since the October 2012 ERO report.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises the importance of Christian values and nurturing each child’s uniqueness through the provision of a warm, caring and supportive environment.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Relationships with parents and families are well developed. Strong community support is in place. Teachers continue to build communication pathways that facilitate parents’ input and feedback. The supervisor has identified the need to continue to enhance the learning partnership between the centre and families.</p><p>The environment is well organised to support children’s interest and participation in learning experiences. Staff are caring and responsive. There is a good range of resources for children to freely investigate. Teachers should continue to work on developing the quality of practices that promote children’s sustained engagement in learning.</p><p>Careful consideration is given to supporting children’s transitions into the centre and on to primary school. Induction for new families includes visits and the sharing of information. Teachers agree they should continue to develop purposeful links with local primary schools to discuss each child's learning and early childhood and school programmes.</p><p>A bicultural perspective is becoming apparent. An enrichment programme led by a visiting teacher is promoting children’s and teachers’ understanding of aspects of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori. ERO and the supervisor agree that a next step is for teachers to study recent Ministry of Education resources to develop understanding of suitable ways to work with Māori learners and their whānau. A focus on strengthening cultural responsiveness should continue to be promoted.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are welcome at the service. Teachers have knowledge of community agencies and information to support the participation of these children in the programme.</p><p>Teachers are proactive in developing the centre programme. Children’s emerging ideas, exclamations, interests and strengths increasingly form the basis of planning for learning. Teachers document rich records of children’s participation and significant learning over time. Parents’ input and feedback are encouraged and valued. Next steps for the team should include:</p><ul>
<li>a greater emphasis, in profile books, on showing children’s progress over time and the value added to their learning through the planning and implementation of specific strategies</li>
<li>regular evaluation of aspects of the programme to inform decisions about planning linked to teacher practice and children’s learning</li>
<li>increased acknowledgment of children’s cultures, languages and identities in learning records</li>
<li>a stronger focus on presenting literacy in play-based contexts, linked to the intent of the early childhood curriculum.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers work well together as a team. Leaders actively seek appropriate development opportunities to improve the curriculum and teachers’ practice. Regular opportunities for discussion support the sharing of ideas and information about children.</p><p>The appraisal process supports teachers’ reflection on some aspects of their practice. A revised approach is being considered. Links with practising teacher requirements are being developed. The following should add rigour and help ensure all legislative requirements are met:</p><ul>
<li>the addition of regular constructive feedback focused on improvement goals</li>
<li>the collection of a suitable range of evidence showing competence in relation to teaching standards.</li>
</ul><p>Leadership aspects should be included in the appraisal of the director and supervisor. The provision of formal appraisal and focused professional development, linked to an early childhood education context, should be a priority to support the director in her role. A suitable induction and mentoring programme must be put in place for the provisionally registered teacher.</p><p>Self review is valued and regularly undertaken by teachers to improve outcomes for children. Professional development is in place to support increased understanding and use of a more evaluative process.</p><p>The quality of governance needs improvement. Priorities for development are policies, procedures and guidelines to support trustees to define, understand and undertake their governance responsibilities. Other elements of a more sustainable approach should include trustees taking a more active role in strategic planning, policy review and development and the appraisal of the director. Trustees should seek more comprehensive reporting from service management to support decision making at board level.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The director and supervisor should continue to develop:</p><ul>
<li>a bicultural perspective in the programme</li>
<li>assessment and planning</li>
<li>the team’s understanding and use of self review.</li>
</ul><p>The director and board of trustees should:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop the teacher and supervisor appraisal processes</li>
<li>develop and implement an appraisal for the director</li>
<li>seek appropriate professional support for centre leadership</li>
<li>define and further develop the governance and management roles in the centre.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Centre Kidz Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice, the board of trustees should ensure a suitably rigorous appraisal process is implemented for the director.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Centre Kidz Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>7 October 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
