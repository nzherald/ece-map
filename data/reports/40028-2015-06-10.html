</table><p>While there is a new group of parents making a positive difference, there is still much work to be done to bring the centre up to the standard required to ensure that children and their families learn and play in a high quality environment.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Galatea Playcentre is a small, rural, parent-led early childhood service located in Galatea, near Murupara. The playcentre caters for children from birth to school age and is licensed for 25 children, including 12 up to the age of two. After the 2012 ERO review, the roll dropped due to children going on to school and families moving out of the area. Numbers are now growing again and at the time of this review, there were 21 children on the roll, three of whom identify as Māori. There is currently one morning session each week during which a supervisor helps the centre meet qualification requirements.</p><p>A relatively new group of parents is focused on improving the learning and play environment for children, and is in the process of re-landscaping the outdoor area. With advice from the association, the parents have addressed aspects of maintenance and health and safety, and have organised fundraising for the centre. Parents are increasing their levels of course work and have attended professional development to help them gain their qualifications.</p><p>The supervisor is modelling good quality interactions and assessment practices. Parents have worked hard to present the indoor environment and resources attractively. They are developing their understanding about assessment, planning and evaluation. However, there remain challenges for which parents need extra support. Some of these challenges were also identified in the 2012 ERO report. These include:</p><ul>
<li>building parents’ understanding of, and commitment to, the requirements of playcentre organisation, policies and procedures, and increasing communication with the association</li>
<li>completing the upgrade of the physical environment and clarifying their understanding about managing health and safety</li>
<li>increasing the engagement of parents in course work, assessment, planning and evaluation, and developing a shared understanding of high quality practice in early childhood education</li>
<li>extending parents' understanding and use of self review as a tool for improvement.</li>
</ul><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight playcentre reviews in the Eastern Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their parents/whānau are increasingly developing a sense of ownership and belonging at the centre. Children help parents set out the resources and equipment, and enjoy playing with one another or independently. The spacious outdoor area offers scope for exploration and discovery in a natural environment and there are appropriate resources available for children. Indoors, parents support their children to play games, enjoy stories and puzzles, and engage in creative activities.</p><p>Parents welcome new members and their children into a friendly, family-like culture. They establish positive and supportive relationships and celebrate events and special occasions. Parents have been involved in fund raising to help bring about centre improvements and are making connections with the wider community. Māori perspectives are included within the centre environment and in practice.</p><p>Parents are increasing their involvement in ongoing education. They have sought external help to assist them with course work and to improve their skills in writing learning stories. The centre supervisor models positive learning interactions with children and provides guidance and support for parents. Parents are developing strategies to build on children’s preferences and sustain an interest over time.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation provides overall guidance, support and strategic direction for the local association and centres. The Eastern Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association aims to promote parent membership and is proactive in supporting local events and activities. There are clear policies, procedures and guidelines for self review, assessment, planning and evaluation. Playcentre workshops help parents establish strategies and practices that ensure positive educational outcomes for children. At the time of this ERO review the national federation was in the process of considering changes to the governance and management structure of the organisation.</p><p>New parent leaders, with guidance from the association, have worked hard to begin the required improvements to the centre property, environment and organisation. Parents are taking on leadership roles and a support liaison person from the association is linked to the centre. A challenge for this centre is its isolated location and the distance needed to travel to attend meetings and association workshops. Leaders are now improving attendance and participation, and responding to association requests.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the association leaders agree that significant next steps for review and development are as follows:</p><ul>
<li>complete the upgrade of the physical environment</li>
<li>continue to foster parent education and understanding of playcentre practices and expectations</li>
<li>grow parent confidence in developing high quality learning interactions, planning and assessment</li>
<li>with the support of the wider association, develop a strategic and annual plan</li>
<li>establish robust self-review processes to bring about improvement.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Galatea Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance in this centre. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>develop an annual plan to guide practice</li>
<li>improve understandings and procedures related to privacy of children.</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6, GMA8]</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Galatea Playcentre will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>10 June 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
