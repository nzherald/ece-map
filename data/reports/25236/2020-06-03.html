</table><p>Tui Road Playcentre requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Tui Road Playcentre needs external support to review and improve the quality of all aspects of centre operations.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tui Road Playcentre is a well-established service in Papatoetoe. It operates as a parent cooperative under the umbrella of the Playcentre Aotearoa, Auckland Regional Hub (ARH). The centre is open for three sessions per week. The majority of the member families are new. It is licensed for 25 children, including 15 infants.</p><p>A newly appointed centre support worker (CSW) helps members to develop a shared understanding about the curriculum and centre operations. Two service support workers (SSW) are employed to support members during the centre's hours of operation.</p><p>The Playcentre philosophy of <span lang="mi">'whānau tupu ngātahi',</span> adults and children learning together, continues to underpin the culture of the centre. Every member is responsible for the quality of teaching and learning as well as aspects of management and governance. Parents and whānau are valued as being the best educators of their children. Sessions are guided by <em><span lang="mi">Te Whāriki</span></em>, the early childhood curriculum, and a commitment to <span lang="mi">Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</span></p><p>The 2016 ERO report noted families' enjoyment of their time in the centre. A range of learning experiences supported children’s participation in play. It identified next steps to improve the curriculum and recognised the challenge of attracting membership. Building and sustaining centre membership continues to be a challenge. Changes in the Playcentre organisational structure have had an impact on aspects of this centre's operations.</p><p>The new structure of Playcentre Aotearoa is now fully operational and a review of this new structure is currently underway. The organisation provides a sound management framework as well as support personnel to assist centre members in managing their centres. Playcentre Aotearoa administers centres’ funding and provides an adult education programme for parents/whānau to achieve Playcentre qualifications. Centre members have adopted planned approaches to embracing and implementing the Playcentre Aotearoa policy framework. A new licensee/contact person is in the process of being appointed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews in the Playcentre <span lang="mi">Aotearoa,</span> Auckland Regional Hub.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and settled. Centre members provide a well-resourced environment that encourages child-initiated play for a mixed age group. Children choose from a wide range of activities. Adults are available to provide assistance as needed. The large outside area enables children to participate in physically challenging, active play. Children play well alongside their peers and engage in sustained play.</p><p>The CSW and SSW support members to design a learning programme that is responsive to children's interests and developmental needs. They should continue to provide leadership and model ways of supporting and extending children’s play.</p><p>Most members are new and are supported by leaders to enact the Playcentre philosophy. This has resulted in families’ strong sense of belonging. Warm, caring relationships between adults and children underpin positive interactions. New centre members are encouraged to take an active role in the management of the centre and are gaining a better understanding of their dual roles as parents and educators.</p><p>The regional management team takes responsibility for supporting effective centre operations. They are aware of the strengths and needs of the centre and provide professional leadership to promote improvement and growth. The centre support worker is guided by the regional centre support coordinator. This support helps the centre to continue to develop quality programmes for children, and sound health and safety monitoring practices.</p><p>The ARH should support members at Tui Road to develop and implement a strategic plan that identifies clear goals. They should also support the implementation of internal evaluation processes that focus on continuous improvements in the programmes for children and centre operations.</p><p>More comprehensive support by ARH personnel will be needed to help centre members to establish and sustain good practices in all areas of centre operations, and particularly in implementing <span lang="mi"><em>Te Whāriki</em>.</span></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>With ARH support, key next steps for centre members are to continue building their capability to:</p><ul>
<li>plan, implement and evaluate programmes for children based on their interests, strengths and needs</li>
<li>implement Playcentre's commitment to bicultural practices</li>
<li>develop and implement a robust process of improvement-focused internal evaluation</li>
<li>develop shared understandings about how to implement and monitor the framework of policies and procedures.</li>
</ul><p>Key next steps for Playcentre <span lang="mi">Aotearoa,</span> Auckland Regional Hub, are to:</p><ul>
<li>clarify new roles and engage service leaders in the implementation of the new structure across Auckland Playcentres</li>
<li>increase the rigour of monitoring and quality assurance, and strengthen internal evaluation at all levels</li>
<li>identify and implement strategies for achieving greater consistency of the practices that are strengths in some centres.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tui Road Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, centre members need to ensure that children are wearing hats and have sunscreen on when playing outside.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to health and safety practices, governance and management and the curriculum. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>providing a curriculum that promotes the cultural heritages of both parties to <span lang="mi">Te Tiriti o Waitangi</span> and supporting the right of every child to be confident in their own culture</li>
<li>a record of emergency drills carried out and evidence of how evaluation of the drills inform the annual review of the service's emergency plan</li>
<li>a record of all excursions that includes a documented assessment and management of risk, and evidence of parental permission and approval of adult:child ratios</li>
<li>an ongoing self review process that helps the service maintain and improve the quality of its education and care</li>
<li>an annual plan to guide operations and identify who, what and when, in relation to key tasks undertaken each year.</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C5,6, HS8,17, GMA6,8.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>3 June 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
