</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Totara Park Kindergarten is situated in the suburb of Totara Park, Upper Hutt. It is licensed for 40 children from 8.15am – 12.30pm and 30 children from 1.15 – 3.15pm. At the time of this review 68 children, including 10 Māori, are enrolled. Most of the children enrolled live in Totara Park.</p><p>The Rimutaka Kindergarten Association (the association) governs the kindergarten effectively, and provides senior teacher support. The association is committed to maintaining the ratio of 100% qualified teachers. Well-developed policy guidelines clearly outline association expectations for developing the programme and managing day-to-day operations.</p><p>The teaching team comprises a head teacher and three fully qualified teachers.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises the importance of collaborative partnerships with children and whānau to enhance children's learning.</p><p>The association coordinates the Upper Hutt Professional Learning Community (UPLC) cluster. This focuses on teachers from both the early childhood and primary sectors regularly meeting to support positive transitions to school for children. Totara Park Kindergarten is part of this cluster.</p><p>The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eleven kindergarten reviews in the Rimutaka Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten philosophy is highly evident in practice. Collaborative, respectful and supportive relationships between teachers, children and families assist the provision of a warm and caring environment. Open, friendly conversations with parents help ensure that teachers know the children and their families well.</p><p>The kindergarten curriculum is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em> and is responsive to the emerging interests of children.</p><p>Portfolios provide a good record of individual children's progress and development. In some instances this is tracked over time. The teaching team is working to gain consistency of practice in this area. ERO’s external evaluation agrees with this direction.</p><p>As an outcome of 2013 self review, teachers are gathering and analysing the learning aspirations of whānau and using these to focus teaching for individuals. This practice has just begun.</p><p>Planned activity areas support the programme and offer children freedom of choice and play. The well-resourced environment promotes exploration, challenge and physical development through play. Inside, photographic displays and art work support children's sense of belonging and recall of their involvement in the programme. Excursions into the wider community extend the curriculum.</p><p>Teachers use information and communication technologies well to support literacy development. Dramatic play, art and music are features of the programme.</p><p>Good quality teaching challenges and extends children’s learning. Effective strategies used by teachers include:</p><ul>
<li>open questioning to foster conversations and extend play</li>
<li>playing alongside children at their level and modelling oral language and the use of resources</li>
<li>recalling and building on children’s past learning</li>
<li>encouraging problem solving to increase independence.</li>
</ul><p>All children participate in a strong bicultural learning programme. Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori has a high profile. The use of te reo Māori is becoming more established throughout the kindergarten. ERO recommends that teachers should continue to expand the use of te reo Māori across the curriculum. The bicultural programme provides a good foundation for promoting success for Māori children, as Māori. Māori children with skills and knowledge in te reo and tikanga Māori are provided with opportunities to lead in these areas.</p><p>Teachers clearly recognise the value of providing an inclusive education. Good practice in responding to children with identified learning needs is evident. Kindergarten teachers attend the association special needs cluster meetings.</p><p>Children transitioning to school, and their families, are well supported by teachers. Transition to school information is readily available for parents and whānau.</p><p>The head teacher provides strong leadership. Responsibilities are shared among the team according to interests and strengths. A sense of team is developing through a focus on open communication.</p><p>Self review is a well-understood process. It is evaluative and there have been good outcomes from the review of assessment, planning and evaluation processes.</p><p>Senior teachers provide well-targeted, ongoing support and guidance for staff. They promote regular professional development opportunities and useful systems focused on positive outcomes for children. Planned development of the performance appraisal processes has the potential to further promote teacher development. The newly introduced appraisal system is well implemented.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and team members agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop consistency of practice for identifying children’s learning in portfolios</li>
<li>review how well aligned the phonic programme is to their philosophy</li>
<li>develop and define what success for Māori as Māori means for whānau and the teaching team</li>
<li>add a cultural perspective to the current review of aspirations to consider how specific aspirations can inform the development of strategies to promote success for Māori children, as Māori and Pacific children, as Pacific.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Totara Park Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Totara Park Kindergarten will be in three years.<img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>31 October 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
