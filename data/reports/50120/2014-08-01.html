</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rainbow Inglewood operates under the auspices of Kidicorp Ltd and is provided with strong support through the Professional Services Manager (PSM) and the Business Manager. The organisation also provides a sound policy framework, a wide range of procedures to guide performance and a budget that allows centres to operate with a high degree of individuality to suit their particular families and the neighbourhood in which they are located.</p><p>Over the past few months there have been several staffing changes with the appointment of a new centre manager, new head teachers and some new teachers. Developing into a strong team has been and still is a priority.</p><p>A recent building project to open up the infants and toddlers area has been a positive development. Since the previous ERO review in 2011, the centre has been relicensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em> and now operates under one licence. It provides education and care for up to 65 children, with a maximum of 25 up to two years old.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy of Kidicorp, “making a difference to children’s lives” supports the umbrella organisation’s beliefs and values. After extensive review as a result of the many staffing changes the centre philosophy has been the subject of in-depth and meaningful consultation. The resulting visual representation draws attention to the agreed virtues of enthusiasm, respect, caring, honesty and confidence.</p><p>Staff have written a statement indicating what respect will look like in practice. During ERO observations, these practices were evident in interactions between staff and children and among children themselves. Both children and adults use the language of the virtues.</p><p>Children take responsibility for leading their own learning. Their curiosity is encouraged and their decision-making assisted by the display of interesting, well-organised equipment and good quality resources. Children are engaged and busy. Literacy prompts and resources are placed throughout the centre and naturally incorporated into many aspects of play. Teachers know children well, respond to their cues, engage in conversations, use open questions and offer prompts and choices.</p><p>The centre is in the early stages of developing an understanding of tikanga Māori and making success for Māori visible. The centre manager has made links with the local iwi and others who may be able to work with centre personnel.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are encouraged to explore at their own pace. The atmosphere is calm, relaxed and geared to their natural rhythms. They have access to a wide range of appropriate resources.</p><p>Transition within the centre is unhurried and at the child’s own pace. Transition to school is an area the centre has identified for development and is working with schools and other centres to see how they can more actively support parents in the process.</p><p>The new manager is working with teachers and the PSM to develop a shared understanding about self review. The process is sound. Documentation indicates that both spontaneous and planned, longterm reviews have been undertaken. Staff are growing in confidence in using these processes which ultimately have a positive outcome for children. Self review should be strengthened through the use of a higher level evaluative question as a starting point.</p><p>Kidicorp has developed an improvement-focused appraisal process. The regular cycle for 2013 has been completed. Self reflection, discussion and appraiser feedback are integral parts of the system. The centre has identified that strengthening the quality of the feedback given to staff should make the procedure more useful. As well, the goals set need to be specific so that change and achievement can be more clearly evident and acknowledged. Professional learning and development is generally targeted to outcomes from the appraisal process.</p><p>Parents have been involved in some consultation and surveys. The area of partnerships for learning at the centre has been identified for further development. Questions and invitations are used to seek parental input in portfolios. Notice boards, with attractive informative displays aim to keep parents up-to-date with the programme and a range of activities of interest.</p><p>The assessment, planning and evaluation process is a work in progress. Staff are working on the notice, recognise, respond and evaluate procedures to guide programme development. At this stage, they recognise the interest and the learning taking place and are working on how to respond to this. Assessment for learning for individual children as part of this process is an area for development. In some instances portfolios and learning stories are incomplete.</p><p>Clear expectations for teaching, as defined by the centre, were evident in practice. Teachers successfully used these in a variety of situations when working with children. A positive development is that staff are beginning to discuss and evaluate their own practice.</p><p>The outside area for the up to two-year-old children is spacious and well set out. It provides challenge and is very easily accessible for these young children. The outside play area for the older children is in urgent need of a complete overhaul. Kidicorp Ltd is aware of the situation.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rainbow Inglewood completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rainbow Inglewood will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><p>1 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
