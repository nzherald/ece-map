</table><p>Kids Domain Early Learning Centre is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids Domain Early Learning Centre is licensed to provide education and care for 100 children, including up to 40 aged under two years. The centre is in the grounds of Auckland City Hospital and caters for the children of staff working at the hospital. Children are cared for in two rooms for infants and toddlers, and two for older children. They transition only once through the centre. Each infant room has their own outdoor space. The older children have a shared outdoor space. The service caters for a multicultural community and includes small numbers of Māori and Pacific children.</p><p>The centre is governed by the Auckland Hospital Preschool Society Incorporated and operates as a non-profit community service. The elected member body of the society is the parent led governance group.</p><p>Leadership of the service is provided by the centre director, the education leader and the pedagogical leader. A head teacher is appointed in each of the four rooms. Together they lead a team of 18 qualified teachers and nine non-qualified staff.</p><p>The focus of the philosophy is on respect and recognition of individuality within a learning community. Children are recognised as guardians of the natural world. Teachers view the centre as "research active" where they learn alongside children in an inquiry-based programme. <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and Te Tiriti o Waitangi are recognised as guiding documents.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy is evident in the programme. Centre playgrounds border the extensive grounds of the Auckland Domain, which are regularly accessed by children and teachers. Teachers skilfully enhance children's interest in and exploration of the natural world, inside and outside of the centre gates, through a te ao Māori lens. They actively involve older children in discussion, debate and documentation of their own learning. Diverse viewpoints are respected and contribute to the collective knowledge and learning of the group.</p><p>Children's learning and development is supported by leaders, teachers and others with culturally relevant knowledge and expertise. A kaiako Māori rōpu has recently been established to tautoko the implementation of te reo me nga tikanga Māori. Leaders and teachers weave te ao Māori concepts such as ako, kaitiakitanga, whanaungatanga throughout the programme and centre practices. Children's records of learning reflect their growing knowledge and understanding of the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa, New Zealand.</p><p>Leaders and teachers provide specialised care for infants and toddlers. They consult with whānau to ensure connectivity between home and centre. They respect and implement different cultural and family values regarding childcare. Their deep inquiry into providing an environment and resources that engage and promote learning for younger children has resulted in carefully considered uncluttered, inviting play spaces. Teachers' interactions are calm and respectful, and children are relaxed and settled.</p><p>Teachers talk with and actively listen to children and promote deeper thinking through skilful questioning. They provide learning environments for all children that stimulate curiosity and imagination and their enhanced respect for all peoples. Teachers present children's work to parents and whānau seeking contribution and feedback. Leaders have identified that they would like to continue to investigate new ways to deepen whānau involvement within the service.</p><p>Teachers' inquiries into their practice are leading to new and innovative ways of documenting learning and planning programmes for children. They co-construct the programme with children through adult and child-led inquiries, learning alongside each other.</p><p>Leaders bring a diverse range of skills to the team. A strong core of consistent leadership over a period of years has been instrumental in promoting and sustaining a high-quality programme. A continuous cycle of internal evaluation and inquiry is woven throughout centre practices, operations and the curriculum. The ongoing engagement of leaders and teachers in professional learning enhances children's learning and contributes to continuous, sustained improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders are continuing to develop documentation and communication processes. They plan to explore innovative ways to integrate assessment, planning and evaluation of the programme for children's learning with the perspectives of parents/whānau and the wider community.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids Domain Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>19 February 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
