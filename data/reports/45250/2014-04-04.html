</tr></tbody></table><p>The timing of this review was brought forward so that this playcentre could be reviewed at the same time as other playcentres in the Southland Playcentre Association (SPA). Tramway Playcentre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Tramway Playcentre is located in South Invercargill and provides two morning sessions per week for up to 25 children aged from birth-to-five years. Sessions are regularly attended by about 12 children. Some children attend with their grandparents. Several new families have recently joined the playcentre. A skilful paid educator provides high-quality support for parents as the first teachers of their children.</p>
<p>The areas of strength identified in the June 2012 ERO report are still evident. These include the meaningful interactions adults have with children, the improvements in programme planning and evaluation, and the support given by the SPA. In 2013, the parents have carefully used additional funding to buy equipment that enhances the environment and children’s play.</p>
<p>This review was part of a cluster of 17 reviews in the Southland Playcentre Association..</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p><em>Developments since the last review</em>. The parents have made significant progress in improving aspects of the playcentre environment, the programme and their practices. Since the June 2012 ERO review, the outdoor verandah has been covered to provide an all-weather play area. Outdoor climbing equipment has been purchased giving children more choice and challenge and matting has been laid to provide greater safety. Plans are underway to further improve the outdoor area.</p>
<p>In 2012 parents undertook professional development with an external provider. They have grown in confidence in noticing and recording their children’s learning and take pride in showing this in their children’s profile books. Records of planning for individuals now show a greater focus on children’s learning and development. Discussions held between the duty parents and the educator before and after sessions include specific strategies to support the goals for individual children.</p>
<p>Every child has an individual planning sheet displayed on the wall for all to see. The next step is to ensure that all parents are made aware of each child’s goals and the strategies adults will use to support that child’s learning.</p>
<p><em>Current practice</em>. ERO observed children settled in their play. They are effectively helped to make choices about what they want to do. The educator is a very good role model for the parents. She works closely with the children, supports their learning and extends their thinking.</p>
<p>The parents are mindful of each other’s children, and particularly care for the safety of infants and toddlers.</p>
<p>The playcentre is very well resourced. There is a broad range of activities inside and out for children to enjoy. The group plan for Term 4 has included a number of excursions and visitors to the centre. These events enrich children’s experiences, such as a trip to the Southland museum and a visit from a parent in her concrete-mixer truck.</p>
<p>A small group of dedicated parents ensure the smooth running of the centre. Many parents are undertaking training for playcentre qualifications. One parent is helping others to include te reo Māori in the sessions.</p>
<p><em>SPA Support.</em> The SPA provides strong support to the playcentre through:</p>
<ul><li>ongoing adult education</li>
<li>twice termly visits from the playcentre liaison officer</li>
<li>advice and guidance from a Māori liaison officer</li>
<li>property and maintenance advice</li>
<li>additional funding as required</li>
<li>help to meet relicensing requirements</li>
<li>a policy and strategic planning framework</li>
<li>sound governance practices.</li>
</ul><p>The SPA provides strong leadership to guide the future direction and ongoing improvement of all its centres. This includes the way the association foster emergent leadership. Currently there are high numbers of people participating in playcentre training. The association has identified, and ERO agrees, that its next step is to improve its knowledge and understanding of self review. It then needs to support playcentres to implement effective self review.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>The playcentre parents are in the early stages of documenting the group programme. They agree that this is work in progress.</p>
<p>They have identified that self review is also work in progress. They should continue to work with the SPA to develop their understanding and use of self review. They then need to implement this so that improvements to what happens for children are ongoing.</p>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tramway Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Tramway Playcentre will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p>
<h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p>
<h4>Review Coverage</h4>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
