</table><p>Aspects of governance and management need strengthening especially self review, strategic planning, performance management, and professional development for teachers.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Raglan Childcare &amp; Education Centre is located in the seaside township of Raglan. It is a privately owned centre under the governance of two directors, one of whom is the centre manager. The centre is licensed for 40 children including 12 up to the age of two. Currently there are 48 children on the roll, nine of whom are identified as Māori.</p><p>Children learn and play in two age-related rooms but frequently interact as a whole group and also share the outdoor play area. Two experienced and knowledgeable senior teachers oversee each of the age-related rooms. The centre philosophy promotes the belief that ‘within each child there is a great desire to learn’.</p><p>The centre is well established in the community and has been in operation since 1997. It has had a positive reporting history with ERO. Since the 2012 ERO review, staffing has remained consistent in the under-two area but there have been changes to staff and leadership in the over two’s. Professional development for teachers has included training in assessment practices, the introduction of the ‘Peaceful Curriculum’ for babies and toddlers, learning in the natural world, and the internal sharing of ideas and expertise.</p><p>There has been limited response to the areas for review and development identified in the 2010 and 2012 ERO reports. These relate to strategic planning, appraisal of teachers and self review. Lack of progress is having an effect on quality assurance systems and the professional growth of teachers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a rich curriculum that emerges from their interests and self choice. They participate in music, waiata, action songs and creative arts. Literacy and mathematics are strongly promoted through access to resources and through their play. There is a sustained focus on bicultural practices and the use of the natural environment and resources. As part of the curriculum, good use is made of the surrounding area and teachers have established close connections with the local kohanga reo.</p><p>The indoor and outdoor environments are well resourced, interesting and stimulating. Children are confident in the centre’s home-like centre environment and demonstrate a strong sense of belonging. They readily access resources and activities, and play cooperatively with one another and with the support of their teachers.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to children’s cultural backgrounds and are inclusive of children with diverse learning needs. They provide children with positive guidance, affirmation and respect and listen carefully to their requests. Children’s learning is recorded in learning stories that describe their learning and progress. These stories are used for planning programmes and communicating with parents.</p><p>Teachers help children to manage their self-care routines. For infants and toddlers there is a well-considered approach, underpinned by research and theory, which promotes a peaceful curriculum where teachers are respectful of the child’s rhythms and needs. Routines are unhurried and calm. Teachers respond positively to children’s verbal and non-verbal communication and promote their oral language.</p><p>Senior teachers are experienced and knowledgeable. They oversee the day-to-day organisation of the centre programme, run regular meetings for planning and discussion, and model high quality teaching and assessment practices. They are supportive of staff and responsive to children’s needs and the aspirations of parents and whānau. All teachers establish respectful, caring relationships with children, and promote an inclusive and welcoming centre culture.</p><p>The centre manager/director benefits from the expertise and knowledge provided by the co-director who is trained in early childhood education and co-owns another centre. The centre manager has recently led a consultation and review of the philosophy, vision and values to develop future centre direction.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review, challenges involving roll numbers, finances and staff changes have impacted on the effectiveness of management systems and practices. Some documentation and practices remain out of date, and are not grounded in current good practice and theory in early childhood education.</p><p>The teachers’ appraisal process has been inconsistent over the past few years. There are inadequate guidelines and processes to support provisionally registered teachers, and the alignment to the registered teachers’ criteria has yet to be implemented. No observations of teachers’ practice are documented as part of teacher appraisal and there is no attestation against the professional standards for registered teachers. Teachers set low level goals and are not receiving constructive feedback and feed forward to help grow their practice. These aspects were also mentioned in the 2010 and 2012 ERO reports.</p><p>While there has been recent consultation and efforts made to increase shared understandings, strategic and annual planning remain ineffective and have yet to be fully enacted. Management has identified that self-review processes have lapsed. There are no expectations, shared understandings, procedures and guidelines, and useful information and data to support centre self-review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>There is an urgent need to strengthen and implement strategic planning to include goals, actions and timeframes, and show how these are monitored and evaluated. The strategic plan also needs to be well aligned to the centre vision, values and philosophy. The annual plan needs to be linked to the strategic plan and self review. This should provide management with regular assurance that high quality practice is being maintained and monitored.</p><p>A procedure for planned and spontaneous self review needs to be developed to reflect high quality practice. This procedure should include attention to:</p><ul>
<li>the purpose and understanding of self review</li>
<li>guidelines and documentation to support high quality review processes</li>
<li>a programme of self review linked to the strategic and annual goals.</li>
</ul><p>There is an urgent need to implement robust appraisal processes aligned to professional development and self review. These processes should include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening the mentoring programme for provisionally registered teachers</li>
<li>appraising and supporting senior teachers in their role as leaders of learning</li>
<li>the provision of ongoing feedback and feed forward to teachers related to the agreed dimensions of the professional standards for early childhood teachers</li>
<li>linking professional development to teachers' identified learning goals</li>
<li>developing and implementing quality assurance practices to ensure that the performance management process is completed in a timely manner.</li>
</ul><p>Strategic and annual planning are underdeveloped and have yet to be fully implemented. The centre manager and directors need to adopt a model for strategic and annual planning that allows them to set meaningful and relevant goals. These goals should be aligned to centre priorities for development and improvement, and monitored to show improvement and progress in relation to the goals.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Raglan Childcare &amp; Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strategic and annual planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>performance management for staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>centre-wide self review.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, [GMA6, GMA7, GMA8]</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Raglan Childcare &amp; Education Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>2 September 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
