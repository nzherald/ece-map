</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Precious Pipis Childcare Centre previously operated as Waimauku Childcare Centre. The centre’s last ERO review, in March 2013, identified a significant number of improvements relating to health and safety procedures, and the quality of the learning programme. The centre was renamed Precious Pipis when the new owner took over in September 2015. The centre is licensed for 46 children, with a maximum of 12 under two years of age.</p><p>Improvements have been made in the provision of education and care under the leadership of the new owner and two newly appointed head teachers. A new philosophy guides teachers’ practice, resources have been thoughtfully selected, and the learning programme has been reviewed. The centre facilities, both indoors and outside, have been extensively renovated.</p><p>Spacious premises, including a separate indoor and outdoor area for babies and toddlers, are a feature of the centre. A higher ratio of staff for infants is provided to individualise the daily routines and care of younger children. Children transition to the adjoining preschool area at around two years of age. Transition practices for older children are being further explored with staff of the nearby primary school. </p><p>In addition to upgrading the premises and resources, other key priorities for the new owner have been the employment of new staff and building of effective teaching teams. Well selected teacher development and external expertise and support has been sought by the owner in establishing new management systems and developing a culture of planning, self-review and ongoing improvement. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Precious Pipis Childcare Centre has had a series of ownership and leadership changes since it opened about 15 years ago. The purpose built premises have been extensively upgraded and renovated by the most recent owner. The centre’s rural location, and spacious indoor and outdoor facilities, enhance the learning environment for children and staff.</p><p>Parents appreciate the options of longer hours and flexible services offered by the staff and the nutritious food provided for children throughout the day. Later afternoon tea and early evening meals enable some parents to travel distances for work in the city. Restful areas for sleeping and quiet play contribute to the calm and unhurried pace of the day.</p><p>Resources are well used throughout the centre, including the different ways that children’s literacy and numeracy development is supported. Areas of play have been decluttered, and new equipment thoughtfully added. The attractive, orderly environment enhances children’s play and encourages them to sustain activities for longer periods. The extensive outdoors areas provide challenging and interesting spaces for children’s exploration and physical activity. </p><p>Children form positive relationships with teachers and with each other based on clear expectations for kind and respectful interactions. Teachers are observant of children’s interests and engage with them in purposeful conversations to extend their thinking and understanding. Teachers’ planning relates to themes and events that are relevant to children and their families and provide a focus for their learning.</p><p>The centre owner and two head teachers form an effective management team. They value teacher contributions and have implemented new staff management systems, including regular meetings for teachers to discuss professional practice. Teachers share information and reflect on how well the programme and resources are meeting children’s interests and strengths. The owner’s collaborative leadership style is likely to sustain the centre’s improvement-focused progress and direction.</p><p>Head teachers are considering moves towards a more child-initiated approach to planning. These initiatives are designed to deepen teachers’ understanding of assessing and documenting children’s learning and progress. As the planned new appraisal systems are implemented, teachers will be able to align these developments to their reflections and collect evidence of improvements in their own professional practice.</p><p>The management team is very committed to growing a high quality learning centre based on best practice indicators and ongoing self-review. They have made very good progress in the first year of operation and have established a clear set of priorities for future improvement. A key priority has been a renewed emphasis on biculturalism and cultural responsiveness. These inclusive practices incorporate family backgrounds and value children as individuals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers agree, that in addition to strengthening planning and assessment practices, other centre developments could include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to strengthen learning partnerships with parents, whānau and the local community</li>
<li>developing the use of goal setting in order to evaluate progress in relation to planned priorities.<b> </b></li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Precious Pipis Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Precious Pipis Childcare Centre will be in three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>1 April 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
