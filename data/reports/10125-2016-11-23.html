</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres - Henderson, provides all day education and care for up to 100 children, including a maximum of 40 children under two years of age. Children are catered for in six age-related rooms and two outdoor play spaces.</p><p>The Kindercare organisation's philosophy of 'Safe, Loved and Learning' guides centre beliefs and practices. Programmes are underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. An experienced centre director leads the staff team. An area manager works in partnership with the director to support centre operations.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report noted a particular focus on promoting positive learning outcomes for children, especially those under two years of age and children transitioning into school. ERO suggested that managers and teachers continue developing strategies for supporting Māori and Pacific children's learning. Some steps have been taken to establish relationships with Māori in the local community, and to grow teachers understanding of Māori customs and values.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three Kindercare Learning Centres reviews.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre leaders have a strong focus on making improvements to benefit all children. Some very positive shifts in practice have been made since the 2013 ERO review, including the strong focus on supporting children's oral language and their ongoing development as capable and competent communicators and learners.</p><p>The values of care and respect are central to the curriculum and are modelled well by leaders. They are particularly evident in the rooms for infants and toddlers. Many children are leaders and they enthusiastically share their ideas and engage in discussions with each other.</p><p>Managers and teachers develop an inclusive atmosphere for children and their families, who come from diverse cultural backgrounds. Children are supported to reach their potential and special support is provided for children with different learning abilities and needs. Teachers plan to learn more about Pacific cultures so that they can meaningfully affirm children as Pacific learners.</p><p>Teachers provide a variety of resources, activities and experiences to promote and extend children's learning across curriculum areas. An online, digital portal has increased communications with whānau. It helps teachers to establish respectful and positive partnerships with whānau and contributes to their planning for individual and group learning.</p><p>A strong coaching and mentoring process encourages teachers to individually research and discuss the skills and attributes that constitute high quality teaching practices. Managers are regular participants in the programme and model good practice. As a result, teachers continue to improve, both in their professional knowledge and in their confidence as teachers.</p><p>There is a collaborative and strategic approach to long-term planning. The upgrading of the outdoor area is related to teachers' current focus on strengthening opportunities for children to engage in activities that promote physical dexterity. Staff understand the importance of using technology to communicate more effectively with parents and to support learning. They are committed to continuing to develop this area.</p><p>The strong Kindercare leadership structure is replicated in this centre. The centre director and supervisor have a collaborative and measured approach to leading the teaching team. They encourage teachers to take on responsibilities that grow their professional capability. An emphasis on the centre's internal evaluation and improvement focus is helping to strengthen practices.</p><p>Kindercare provides well established systems and policies to guide centres. These systems are consistently implemented and regularly monitored. The organisation's values and strategic direction also guide each centre. Specific goals are developed by each staff team to guide individual centres. Ongoing support for Kindercare staff ensures centre sustainability, accountability and continued improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers could now support teachers to deepen their understanding of Māori and Pacific languages and cultures and strengthen their partnerships with whānau to enhance their provision for Māori and Pacific children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres - Henderson completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres - Henderson will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>23 November 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
