</table><p>Precious Pipis Childcare Centre requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Precious Pipis Childcare Centre is licensed for 46 children, including up to 12 under two years of age. The centre provides for children in two different spaces based on age, and children access separate indoor and spacious outdoor areas. The roll includes a group of Māori children and small numbers of children with Pacific heritage.</p><p>The centre is one of two privately owned centres, in a rural area in West Auckland. The owner/director and centre manager, both registered teachers, oversee the governance, management and curriculum implementation at both centres. The teaching team at this centre includes five registered teachers.</p><p>Since the 2016 ERO review, there have been significant staffing changes. The teaching team's philosophy is being established. Teachers aim to promote sustainability and work towards becoming a zero-waste centre.</p><p>ERO’s 2016 report identified positive aspects of the centre such as relationships and support for literacy and numeracy learning. These aspects continue to be evident. Areas for improvement included partnerships with parents and evaluating progress in relation to planned priorities. Some progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle quickly and are comfortable in the centre environment. They demonstrate a sense of belonging, and older children confidently approach and initiate conversations with adults. Children choose to play either inside or outdoors, and routines allow for uninterrupted play and exploration. Staff working with younger children respond well to their verbal and non-verbal communication.</p><p>Adults interact in warm and positive ways with children and acknowledge their cultures. Those working with older children, could further involve children in co-constructing the learning environment and assessing their own learning.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are committed to growing their knowledge of te reo and te ao Māori with a view to integrating these into teaching practice.</p><p>A framework has been established for planning the daily programme. Individual portfolios are available for all children. Planning focuses on the provision of resources and sensory, physical and science related activities. There is a need to continue to improve the quality of assessment and planning documentation for all children.</p><p>Leaders are in the process of establishing a vision, mission and philosophy with the new team. A framework of policies and procedures, and internal evaluation is established. Leaders should ensure that all policies meet current legal requirements, are implemented in practice, and that the child protection and recruitment policies align with each other.</p><p>Leaders are committed to the ongoing development of distributed leadership through accessing relevant professional learning opportunities and a new appraisal process. This could more purposefully guide the development of quality teaching practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service provider should continue to build staff capability in:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>engaging more deeply with <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, to ensure the provision of a rich curriculum for every child</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing systematic, planned, and deliberate inquiries into current practice to improve outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>setting robust goals linked to the standards of teaching and the centre's strategic plan and vision.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Precious Pipis Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to provision for health and safety. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>annual review of the emergency plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recording of sleep checks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recording of illnesses.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS7,9,27.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>7 February 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
