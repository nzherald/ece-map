<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Laura Ingram Kindergarten is developing its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children. Progress is well supported by good governance from the association and guidance from the Senior Education Adviser.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Laura Ingram Kindergarten attracts children and families from a large catchment area. The kindergarten is licensed for 44 children aged two years and over. Recently, teachers have begun enrolling children who have just turned two years of age, which has implications for the curriculum provided for children. The teaching team is new. A family liaison group supports the teachers, assists with fundraising and facilitates a range of social occasions for parents. The head teacher works closely with external agencies to provide families with a wider support network in the community.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Nelson Kindergarten Association (the association) and overseen by a team of Senior Education Advisors (SEAs). The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews of eight early childhood services within the Nelson Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are warm, responsive, welcoming and respectful to both children and parents. Children have many opportunities to engage in sustained play. Their sense of belonging is promoted. Children have access to a range of information and communication technologies. Staff liaise with external agencies to provide ongoing assistance to improve outcomes for children and families. The kindergarten's vision is evident in teachers' practice.</p><p>The programme is underpinned by the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>. Teachers appropriately plan for groups and individuals. The specific planning for individual children is often a reflection of what the child has been doing and how their interests may be extended</p><p>Portfolios are interesting and well presented. They highlight children&rsquo;s engagement and developing relationships, the growth of their physical skills and learning progress. Teachers focus on capturing in learning stories the voices of parents and children.</p><p>Routines are consistently implemented, giving children a sense of security. Transition to school is supported through positive relationships with local schools. There is a range of useful information available to parents.</p><p>Teachers encourage and invite parents to take an active role in their child&rsquo;s learning. Friendly and informative interactions between parents and children occur frequently during the day. Leaders and teachers understand the value and importance of positive relationships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>The association has recently updated its appraisal procedures to provide clear guidance for staff. Leaders are engaging in ongoing professional learning to support its successful implementation.</p><p>Teachers are supported in their understanding of self review, by the association. There is strong alignment between the guiding documents of the association and kindergarten and the resulting review. Spontaneous and regular review has been well used to improve outcomes for children.&nbsp; The teachers and association are highly consultative, regularly requesting feedback from their parent community. The association has effectively led robust self review and evaluation using a collaborative approach.</p><p>The association provides high levels of guidance and support for teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>clear guiding documents</li>
<li>expectations for programme delivery and kindergarten operations, including health and safety practices</li>
<li>access to a wide range of professional learning and development opportunities.</li>
</ul><p>The SEA regularly visits the kindergarten and provides strong support and leadership to the teaching team. Through SEA guidance and identified next steps teachers are supported to enact the association&rsquo;s vision of providing &ldquo;consistently exceptional early childhood education&rdquo;.</p><p>Equity funding is used effectively to achieve positive outcomes for children.</p><h4>Key Next Steps</h4><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop shared understanding and implementation of health and safety practices and supervision procedures</li>
<li>strengthen links between the voices of parents and children and the planning and assessment cycle. This includes seeking parent aspirations and reflecting these through the learning stories</li>
<li>review how they are adapting their teaching strategies and offering a curriculum appropriate to the age of the learner, and how children&rsquo;s learning is challenged and enriched</li>
<li>continue to develop the bicultural curriculum and teacher confidence in the use of te reo M&#257;ori</li>
<li>continue to build the evaluative capacity of teachers to systematically enquire into and judge the effectiveness of their kindergarten operations. This should assist future decision-making and identify priorities to further enhance children&rsquo;s learning and wellbeing.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Laura Ingram Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><p>21 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
