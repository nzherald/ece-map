</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Community Kindy Pukekohe is a well established all day education and care service for children from the ages of two to five years. The centre is situated on a residential property and previously operated as Montessori @ Pukekohe. Children reflect the diverse cultures within the local community.</p><p>Community Kindy Pukekohe is part of the Kidicorp group of childcare centres. Kidicorp provides a framework for centre operations, good levels of professional development and support for the centre manager and teachers, and a robust quality assurance process.</p><p>The majority of teachers are qualified. The acting head teacher was appointed in June 2013. Previous to her arrival, there were many staff changes. Managers and teachers have reviewed the centre’s philosophy with a view to move from a Montessori focus to a programme that better reflects the aspirations of the local community.</p><p>ERO’s 2011 review recognised the respectful, warm relationships between teachers and children, as well as children’s strong sense of belonging. These, and the ongoing commitment to professional learning and development, continue to be features of the centre.</p><p>ERO’s recommendation to further develop strategic planning has been addressed. Areas for development such as planning, assessment and evaluation, and providing a child-centred programme remain areas for the centre to fully address.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from positive relationships with teachers and with each other. They confidently play with each other and choose how to be involved in the programme. Children have opportunities to participate in swimming and movement classes in the community.</p><p>The learning environment invites exploration and appeals to children’s natural curiosity. Children benefit from the recently renovated outdoor environment. Teachers are aware of the need to promote further challenge in the programme and to continue increasing children’s access to varied and interesting resources.</p><p>Managers are beginning to support staff to develop more consistent understandings and practices and to establish a more responsive, child-centred curriculum.</p><p>Managers and teachers have identified the need to more actively consult with parents, document their contributions, and increase their involvement in the programme and centre operations. Centre staff are also keen to increase the extent to which New Zealand’s bicultural heritage is reflected in the programme and in the environment.</p><p>The centre is well managed and led. Teachers benefit from the clear management structure, modelling and support aimed at improving learning outcomes for children. Managers show a strong commitment to ongoing improvement with an increased focus on strengthening the influence of<em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, in the centre.</p><p>Strategic planning goals are clear and appropriate, focusing on teaching and learning, family involvement and self review. Managers have considered and taken steps to improve the long term viability of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO affirms the centre’s priorities to continue:</p><ul>
<li>focussing teachers’ planning, assessment and evaluation cycle on children’s individual dispositions for learning</li>
<li>promoting the consistent use of effective teaching and learning strategies to extend children’s learning and creativity</li>
<li>considering ways to promote success for Māori children.</li>
</ul><p>ERO and centre leaders also discussed ways to strengthen teaching practices and provision for children by:</p><ul>
<li>using <em>Te Whāriki</em> to evaluate how effectively the centre prepares children for their transition to school</li>
<li>enhancing self-review processes by including the use of indicators of effective practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Community Kindy Pukekohe completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Community Kindy Pukekohe will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>9 May 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
