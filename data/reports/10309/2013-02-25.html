<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>St Peter Chanel Preschool is becoming better placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The Catholic special character of St Peter Chanel Preschool is clearly evident in centre practices. Children participate in daily prayer and absorb Catholic teachings and beliefs. Many children attending are Pacific and some are from Iraqi backgrounds. The Samoan language and culture are the focus of bilingual practices. Basic vocabulary in te reo M&#257;ori and Arabic is used in the programme to help give children a sense of belonging in the centre.</p><p>The management committee has recently appointed a new supervisor who has been employed as a teacher in the centre for the past nine years. This appointment has enabled staff to improve centre operations and to make progress towards achieving long-term goals.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>The centre provides a nurturing environment for children. Children are settled on arrival, engage cooperatively and enthusiastically throughout the day, and are keen to learn. The new supervisor works collaboratively with staff.</p><p>Pacific children make up seventy-nine percent of the roll. Most are Samoan and Samoan language is the main Pacific language used in displays, greetings and basic vocabulary. Centre managers are aware of the need to ensure that Pacific children attend early childhood services and actively support children&rsquo;s access to the centre. Parents are welcome in the centre and managers and teachers know the families well.</p><p>Catholic beliefs and practices are an important part of the daily programme and children participate confidently in regular routines. Children learn in a multilingual, inclusive environment. Samoan, Arabic and te reo M&#257;ori are integrated into the programme through the day. Te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori are affirmed and celebrated in the centre and included in resources and displays. Some parents actively contribute aspects of M&#257;ori language and culture to the programme. All children enthusiastically participate in waiata and are familiar with basic te reo M&#257;ori.</p><p>Children are well cared for in the centre and settle in well. They have opportunities to learn from trips into the wider community. Teachers use these experiences in the daily programme to draw on and extend children&rsquo;s interests. Children&rsquo;s learning is clearly evident in art displays, photographs and individual portfolios.</p><p>Although there is a separate indoor area for children up to the age of two, younger and older children have opportunities to play together in the outdoor environment. These opportunities to mix support their social development and help to create a family atmosphere.</p><p>Teachers have good opportunities to participate in a range of professional learning opportunities, including special character and self-review workshops. Professional learning is beginning to support teachers to review their practices and improve their teaching.</p><p>The management committee is committed to and supports the centre&rsquo;s ongoing improvement. Committee members are developing effective management systems and ensure that all financial processes are clear and well monitored. They have specific roles and responsibilities and meet regularly to ensure that all aspects of centre operations are effectively managed.</p><p>Processes are in place to review the special character of the centre, planning, assessment and evaluation and to discuss the implementation of professional development. Engagement in this self review helps to build a culture of reflection and ongoing improvement. Managers and teachers should continue to strengthen self review across all aspects of centre operations, environment and the learning programme. Better self review would help improve children&rsquo;s learning over time and contribute to sustaining a professional culture of self reflection.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>To strengthen centre self review, the committee and staff should:</p><ul>
<li>regularly review policies and organise them more effectively under relevant areas of centre operations</li>
<li>regularly report to parents against the centre&rsquo;s key strategic goals and key aspects of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum.</li>
</ul><p>To improve programmes for children, teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>develop clear expectations of effective teaching strategies in all aspects of the programme</li>
<li>continue to develop children&rsquo;s self-management and creative skills as they play and particularly in the transition to school programme.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of St Peter Chanel Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Recently the centre experienced a major financial issue. This is being appropriately addressed with the help of external agencies. The supervisor and management committee have been proactive in ensuring that financial processes are clearly monitored and reported.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>25 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
