<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Au Pair Link is a national home-based education and care service with a number of licences across New Zealand. This is the first Education Review for Au Pair Link, Wellington 1. The network is licensed for 80 children aged less than two years and 80 aged over two. At the time of this review 32 children were enrolled. The area manager and two family and programme managers are responsible for the provision of home-based care, implementing a quality curriculum for children and for the ongoing professional growth of au pairs in the area.</p><p>Au pairs are generally recruited from Europe, the USA, the UK and Canada. They attend orientation on arrival. Guiding documentation for this process provides information on Au Pair Link&rsquo;s mission, programme expectations, regulations and policies. Individuals have the opportunity to acquire knowledge about children&rsquo;s development and behaviour to assist them to safely and effectively care for children.</p><p>Strategic planning has appropriately determined key priorities for the service. Au Pair Link managers have begun to determine performance indicators and expected outcomes from these goals to strengthen their review process. ERO affirms this direction.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The programme managers visit au pairs regularly and provide advice and guidance. They supplement home resources, particularly in response to children&rsquo;s emerging interests. There is an expectation that au pairs will support the learning and development of each child through the provision of programmes aligned to the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>.</p><p>The Au Pair Link mission is to provide cultural, affordable and quality in-home childcare for families. Au pairs are placed in family homes for up to twelve months. At orientation, au pairs receive a range of information to promote their well-being and support their work with children. Au pairs receive an overview of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, and initial guidance to assist them in suitably encouraging children's interests and responding to their emerging needs.</p><h3>Areas of good performance</h3><p>Children engage in a range of child-initiated, play-based experiences. Au pairs' capacity to provide learning opportunities that are always relevant, authentic and interesting is variable. Excursions into the wider community provide children and adults with additional activities and regular social interaction in a larger group. Au pairs spoken to, who choose to attend these experiences, acknowledge they are a useful way of networking with other adults and sharing ideas.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s individual portfolios are well presented records of happenings and experiences with their au pair. Some au pairs visited by ERO capture children&rsquo;s passions and significant moments of learning. They recognise and respond to their emerging interests within narratives. Children revisit these &ldquo;memories of their life and the experiences they share with their au pair and wh&#257;nau&rdquo;. Parents are encouraged to share events about their child through frequent conversations with their au pair and regular contact with the family and programme manager.</p><p>Parents receive ongoing information to assist with the inclusion of an au pair into their home and liaise regularly with family and programme managers. Newsletters, email correspondence and home visits support families to access relevant information to assist the work of au pairs. The family and programme manager provides useful verbal and written feedback to au pairs on a regular basis.</p><p>Responsive and reciprocal interactions are evident. Au pairs encourage and display positive values and behaviours. They participate in children&rsquo;s activities; working with them at their level and at times modelling appropriate play. Children are encouraged to listen, share ideas and communicate. Au pairs visited know their children well and respond promptly to requests and physical and emotional needs.</p><p>Au Pair Link managers meaningfully reflect on and respond to the outcomes of planned and spontaneous self review. Continued review of the curriculum has focused on considering the processes, including assessment, that build practice and support children&rsquo;s learning. Clear priorities for review have been established and information gathered to consider current practice.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>Au pairs' ability to recognise and respond to individual learning, including the cultural context of M&#257;ori and Pacific children, requires further support and guidance. Au Pair Link managers should review and extend current processes to assist au pairs to set relevant goals to develop their practice. Aligning professional learning and development (PLD) and providing more specific feedback should increase au pair knowledge of expected practice and lift educational outcomes for children.</p><p>Au Pair Link area managers have developed six key strategic goals to build practice and promote future development. This includes a focus on the purposeful inclusion of M&#257;ori and Pacific families and children. Through discussions with ERO, area managers have begun to determine performance indicators for the goals. Identifying expected outcomes from these indicators should align the service&rsquo;s mission, strategic intent and actions contained in the annual plan. It should also improve self review at all levels of the organisation.</p><p>Family and programme managers state that au pairs have opportunities for professional development and role modelling of good practice through weekly playgroups. At times, the ability to attend these sessions conflicts with daily plans and programmes parents may have for their child. Managers should consider further ways to ensure parents are aware of expectations for curriculum design and delivery and PLD for home-based care.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Au Pair Link Wellington 1 completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
