</table><p>Junior Junction is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Junior Junction is located in central Hamilton and provides full-day education and care for children from infants to school age. The centre operates three aged-based rooms with separate outdoor spaces. It is licensed for 50 children including 12 under the age of two years. The current roll of 46 children includes eight who identify as Māori and 16 from a wide range of other ethnic groups. The diversity of teachers' cultural backgrounds reflects that of children and families in the centre.</p><p>Junior Junction is one of seven early learning centres governed by a director. The centre manager supports an assistant manager to oversee teaching practices. Leadership provides an overarching governance and management framework for enacting the strategic direction.</p><p>Through its philosophy, the centre values and respects each child's right to participation in education. The centre promotes collaborative partnerships with family and community as being central to each child's learning and development.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are empowered to make independent decisions about their learning. They are viewed as competent and confident learners. Teachers are highly responsive to the needs of children. Positive, reciprocal interactions support children's strong sense of belonging. They are well supported to develop social competencies through the consistent use of positive guidance practices. Children with additional learning needs are fully involved in the learning environment through inclusive teaching practices.</p><p>The curriculum is effectively designed to reflect the context of each child, their family and the community. Individual planning, in collaboration with families is responsive to each child's abilities, needs and interests. Assessment builds a clear picture of what each child knows, understands, are interested in and can do. Literacy, mathematics, music and science are naturally woven throughout the programme. Teachers encourage children to explore their working theories through rich conversation, providing effective oral language support. Children up to the age of two years benefit from individualised routines and form secure attachments with familiar caring adults. Positive transitions into and out of the centre support children's confidence. Children experience a stimulating environment that promotes their wellbeing and excitement for learning.</p><p>Through a range of activities and practices, children are supported to understand te ao Māori. Teachers have extensive knowledge of children as learners and actively seek ways to continually strengthen connections to children’s language, culture and identity. Emphasis should now be on embedding centre knowledge of local Māori history to enrich the programme.</p><p>Leaders base relationships on respect, trust and reciprocity. Emergent leadership amongst teachers is encouraged. There are opportunities for regular professional learning and development with ongoing mentoring and support for teachers. Leaders have developed clear guidelines and expectations for teaching practice and curriculum delivery.</p><p>A clear vision sets the direction for the service. Internal evaluation is effective and contributes to continual improvement to the service for children and their families. There is clear alignment between the strategic direction and annual plans. The appraisal process supports teachers to strengthen their practice, supported by regular and ongoing coaching and mentoring. The organisation's philosophy, vision and goals promote positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for leaders and teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>embed local knowledge and histories into the centre’s curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop internal evaluation practices to guide centre direction and ongoing improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Junior Junction completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>19 December 2019</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
