</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Arthur Burns Pre-school is a community-based early childhood service for children aged 2 to 5 years. It is located adjacent to Silverstream School in a new building. The outdoor environment has been redeveloped to reflect New Zealand’s dual heritage and some of the geographic characteristics of the local area.</p><p>The pre-school’s philosophy outlines what the teachers and community value. Respectful relationships that support learning in a safe, well-equipped, nurturing environment are emphasised.</p><p>Since the last ERO review, teachers have had professional development that has supported them in improving systems for planning and assessment and developing their understanding of self-review processes and practice. Some challenges in 2013 led to some systems and processes not being followed, such as no appraisal of staff in 2013.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The teachers and staff are welcoming and support children and families in their community. They have built caring and respectful relationships with them and aim to know the children and their wider context well.</p><p>The teachers work effectively together to provide a wide curriculum that includes science, literacy learning, art, drama and many opportunities for children to develop physical skills. Children are self-motivated and independent and can choose from a wide range of good quality resources and equipment. Children cooperate in decision making around their work and play.</p><p>Teachers frequently reflect on their practice. They have regular conversations about children’s learning. Much of this is informal and not documented. Teachers acknowledge the need for consistent use of planning, assessment and documentation systems.</p><p>There have been some useful developments in teaching and learning resulting from recent professional learning around self review. Teachers agree that this needs further development.</p><p>Teachers are developing useful bicultural practices. The children are becoming confident with some tikanga practices and with Māori phrases and waiata.</p><p>In 2013, in response to community needs the committee changed the session times to enable more 2-3 year olds to attend the pre-school programmes. These toddlers benefit from the stimulating range of activities and experiences teachers provide. The next step is for teachers to review how well the curriculum promotes positive outcomes for these toddlers.</p><p>Arthur Burns is well governed and a well-managed centre where teachers receive effective support from a dedicated committee.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teachers acknowledge the need to continue to improve assessment practices, self review, and the programme’s bicultural content. They agree they need to look again at what information they collect and record, and how this is used to support and extend children’s learning and development.</p><p>This includes:</p><ul>
<li>making the links between identified priorities for learning and the planned programme more visible</li>
<li>ensuring learning records show the interests, strengths and cultural identity of individual children, the next steps for their learning and the strategies teachers used or will use to support these</li>
<li>clarifying the links between the centre’s philosophy, teachers’ priorities for learning and the centre’s future planning</li>
<li>monitoring the service's progress in meeting the centre goals.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers need to also develop a schedule for self review to ensure aspects of the service that most impact on children are regularly evaluated.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Arthur Burns Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Arthur Burns Pre-School will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>14 May 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
