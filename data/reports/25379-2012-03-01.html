<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Lollipops Educare Waiuku (Centre Two) opened in 2009 to serve the community of Waiuku and provides education and care for children over two years of age. The site is shared with a centre for children under two years old. The centre operates under the framework and policy base of Lollipops Educare. The centre&rsquo;s philosophy focuses on enabling children to become competent and confident learners.</p><p>Children actively engage in collaborative and independent play and exploration. They are encouraged to think about and justify decisions they make during play.</p><p>Staff support children well to belong and contribute to the centre community. They cater effectively for the diversity of children&rsquo;s learning needs so that children are able to participate fully in programmes.</p><p>Centre staff foster a warm, caring atmosphere which is welcoming to parents and community members. Respectful interactions amongst children and with adults contribute to the calm, settled environment. Children are content to play purposefully on their own or with others for sustained periods of time.</p><p>The internal environment is spacious and well laid out to invite children&rsquo;s curiosity and experimentation. Children have good access to a variety of resources, including natural resources, to cater for their changing interests and needs. The centre management team is now considering ways to extend outdoor areas to accommodate additional physical challenges.</p><p>The service is led efficiently by the centre director and licensee. They use self-review processes effectively to challenge the thinking and practice of all staff as part of their commitment to continuous improvement. The centre director provides sound professional leadership. All staff receive planned professional learning and development that aligns with local centre and national priorities.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Lollipops Educare Waiuku (Centre Two) was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atLollipops Educare Waiuku (Centre Two).</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>the quality of management.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Lollipops Educare Waiuku (Centre Two) operates two rooms in a purpose-built centre. Teachers are committed to ensuring that the centre&rsquo;s philosophy is reflected in practice. As a result, they give priority to ensuring that children and their families feel that they belong in the centre, and that they are well cared for and able to learn.</p><p>Strong professional leadership and stable staffing contribute to the provision of a happy, settled environment. The centre director and staff constantly seek ways to review their provision of care and education for children.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Children choose play activities from the generously resourced environment. Teachers plan and prepare stimulating environments in response to children&rsquo;s new and continuing interests and current centre-wide topics for learning. They have included te reo M&#257;ori and M&#257;ori perspectives thoughtfully into programmes and in the centre environment.</p><p>Each child benefits from an individual plan for their stage of learning and development in line with their emerging character and preferences. Teachers document children&rsquo;s learning progressions in portfolios for parents and children. Many parents also document their pride in children&rsquo;s achievement and the positive character traits that are becoming increasingly evident.</p><p>The centre is bright and attractive. The layout and accessibility of resources motivate children to explore and engage in play for considerable periods of time. Children revisit and discuss portfolios and child-centred displays. They have good opportunities to celebrate and share their achievements.</p><p>Most children choose to play together and learn from each other. They use social skills effectively to negotiate the leadership and direction of play. Teachers skilfully choose appropriate times to join in, but know when to allow children to lead and direct their play without interruption. They give children time to think creatively before answering questions. Children are developing a good understanding of ways to include mathematics and literacy learning in their activities.</p><p>Children and their parents are warmly welcomed in the centre. Teachers quickly encourage children to scan the environment and choose their play. Parents are encouraged to share their wishes for children&rsquo;s learning and development. Teachers respond positively to parents&rsquo; views.</p><p>Promoting children&rsquo;s well being is a centre priority. Planned, fluid transition processes ease children&rsquo;s settling into new environments. Centre managers have increased liaison with local schools to further support children&rsquo;s transition to school.</p><h4>Area for development and review</h4><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that teachers should seek ways to challenge children to increase the levels of complexity and creativity in their play.</p><h3>The quality of management</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Waiuku (Centre Two) was opened in 2009. An experienced management team provides effective leadership. The centre is part of the wider Lollipops Educare organisation.</p><p>Staff review and modify policies, procedures and practices to reflect their practice and relevance in the Waiuku community. The centre director is responsible for the day-to-day management of the centre.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>The centre director and licensee have a clear vision for the centre&rsquo;s direction. The centre director and two team leaders form a leadership team and guide and monitor centre programmes and operations. They ensure that all children access the curriculum and receive good care, consistent with the centre&rsquo;s philosophy.</p><p>A robust performance management system is in place to acknowledge and make good use of teachers&rsquo; strengths and skills. Teachers are provided with clear guidelines and professional learning that is targeted to centre and personal teaching developmental needs. Provisionally registered teachers receive a purposeful programme of advice and guidance to help them achieve registration.</p><p>Well documented self-review processes are used effectively to inform ongoing improvements. Planned and spontaneous review includes the views of parents and staff. Health and safety matters are regularly reviewed to promote a safe environment for children.</p><h4>Areas for review and development</h4><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that their next priorities for improving centre operations are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop and refine their long-term strategic planning document</li>
<li>ensure that the centre director is appraised annually.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing wellbeing, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3><p>All children who wish to attend are enrolled in the centre. Children with special needs are currently enrolled. Teachers share their observations of children&rsquo;s behaviour and their engagement in learning with parents and suggest further exploration by external experts if they believe this would benefit children. The centre director is committed to teachers and parents working in partnership.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>On enrolment, and in further conversations, centre leaders engage sensitively and openly with parents about their children&rsquo;s progress and development. The centre director&rsquo;s sound knowledge of external support services enables timely support to be put in place for parents and children where this would be helpful.</p><p>Children with special needs are well supported to participate fully in the centre programme. Teachers and parents plan learning programmes that enable children with special needs to participate in the same ways as all other children. Transitions into, within, and from the centre are managed well to support children&rsquo;s progress. These processes are developed in consultation with parents.</p><h3>Area for development and review</h3><p>Centre managers agree that, as part of planning for the centre&rsquo;s vision, it is timely to document the practices and procedures in place to provide for children with special needs.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Lollipops Educare Waiuku (Centre Two) completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>

</table><p>1 March 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-lollipops-educare-waiuku-centre-two" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Lollipops Educare Waiuku (Centre Two)</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Lollipops Educare Waiuku (Centre Two).</p><p>Lollipops Educare Waiuku (Centre Two) opened in 2009 to serve the community of Waiuku and provides education and care for children over two years of age. The site is shared with a centre for children under two years old. The centre operates under the framework and policy base of Lollipops Educare. The centre&rsquo;s philosophy focuses on enabling children to become competent and confident learners.</p><p>Children actively engage in collaborative and independent play and exploration. They are encouraged to think about and justify decisions they make during play.</p><p>Staff support children well to belong and contribute to the centre community. They cater effectively for the diversity of children&rsquo;s learning needs so that children are able to participate fully in programmes.</p><p>Centre staff foster a warm, caring atmosphere which is welcoming to parents and community members. Respectful interactions amongst children and with adults contribute to the calm, settled environment. Children are content to play purposefully on their own or with others for sustained periods of time.</p><p>The internal environment is spacious and well laid out to invite children&rsquo;s curiosity and experimentation. Children have good access to a variety of resources, including natural resources, to cater for their changing interests and needs. The centre management team is now considering ways to extend outdoor areas to accommodate additional physical challenges.</p><p>The service is led efficiently by the centre director and licensee. They use self-review processes effectively to challenge the thinking and practice of all staff as part of their commitment to continuous improvement. The centre director provides sound professional leadership. All staff receive planned professional learning and development that aligns with local centre and national priorities.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
