</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Koromiko Kindergarten is situated in Hawera, Taranaki. It is one of 24 kindergartens administered by the newly established entity Kindergarten Taranaki, formerly known as the North and South Taranaki Kindergarten Associations. The board is responsible for setting the overall strategic and policy direction for the organisation. Four professional leaders are employed to support professional learning and development for teachers. The present management structure is under review.</p><p>The kindergarten is licensed for 37 children over two years of age. All teachers are qualified and registered. Since the July 2012 ERO report, there has been a strengthening of self-review processes and ongoing development of assessment, planning and evaluation of the learning programmes.</p><p>The Kindergarten philosophy has clear links to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and this is evident throughout practice.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergarten reviews in Kindergarten Taranaki.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>At Koromiko Kindergarten, children participate enthusiastically in a curriculum which is responsive to their strengths, interests and needs. Children have many opportunities for uninterrupted and sustained work and play which supports their learning. Children’s literacy, numeracy and science learning is enhanced through meaningful and interesting activities.</p><p>The physical environment offers challenge and interest and encourages children to explore and become fully involved in a wide range of activities. The environment is uncluttered, well resourced and spacious with an easy flow throughout. It provides good support for teaching and learning. Teaching practice includes a strongly established focus on sustainable environmental practices.</p><p>Teachers have positive, sensitive and responsive relationships with children, helping them to develop independent and social skills as they learn. They extend children’s ideas and support their interests and developing working theories. Teachers work collaboratively and have collective responsibility for all children and their learning. An inclusive culture is evident throughout the kindergarten.</p><p>Assessment, in the form of learning stories, provides a good record of children’s progress over time while at the kindergarten. Well-presented portfolios are available to children so they can revisit and share their learning with others. Teachers continue to explore effective planning and assessment processes to further promote children’s learning.</p><p>Teachers help children and their families to transition into the kindergarten and to school. Staff work with the Hawera Early Years Network to support positive relationships between early childhood and new entrant primary school teachers.</p><p>Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are well integrated into the programme. Teachers continue to develop their understanding of teaching practices that respond to Māori learners. They continue to investigate ways to strengthen partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>Leadership of the kindergarten is supportive and collaborative. The head teacher effectively leads and builds capability within the centre to promote positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>Self review is well embedded and focused on improvement, positive teaching practice and outcomes for children. The strategic plan, self review and appraisal are aligned and guided by the kindergarten’s philosophy. Teachers collect evidence for their appraisal and reflect in relation to the Registered Teacher Criteria. It is supported by targeted professional development. Teachers have a shared understanding of the purpose and use of self review for improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers agree with ERO that:</p><ul>
<li>self review should be further strengthened through evaluating the impact of actions to improve teaching practice which promotes positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>teachers continue to investigate and build onto their practice to include te ao Māori into the curriculum and daily practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Kindergarten Taranaki Key Next Steps</h3><p>Kindergarten Taranaki is a new entity established in March 2014. Collaboratively developed strategies and values guide future direction. An internal review of capacity and capability of non-teaching roles has been completed.  Further development of processes and practices is required.</p><p>ERO, the chief executive and professional leaders agree that priorities for improvement are:</p><ul>
<li>developing the annual plan</li>
<li>strengthening systems and processes for performance management</li>
<li>consistent implementation of appraisal</li>
<li>reviewing and clarifying professional leaders’ role in building teachers’ capability.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Koromiko Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Koromiko Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie,</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central,</p><p>14 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
