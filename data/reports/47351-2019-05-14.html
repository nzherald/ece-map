</table><p>Butterfly Buddies Home Based Education is not well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>To strengthen service provision leaders need to further develop internal evaluation, assessment, planning and evaluation and the quality of curriculum implementation. The level of support provided to kaiako needs to be clearly reflected through the education coordinator's documentation. Monitoring of health and safety practices needs to be rigorous.</p><p>Sustainability of this newly established service is a challenge. The lack of a consistent education coordinator and kaiako impacts on the quality of teaching and learning for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Butterfly Buddies Homebased Education is a licensed, privately owned home-based education and care network in Hawera. Day-to-day management of the service is the responsibility of the owner/manager. At the time of this review, of the six kaiako, four are new in 2019. Of the 12 children on the roll, five identify as Māori.</p><p>The owner is working towards regaining full teacher certification and there have been several education coordinators employed since the service began operating. The education coordinator with the support of the owner is responsible for the provision of care, implementation of programmes for children and professional support of the home-based kaiako.</p><p>The service's philosophy emphasises the importance of offering a nurturing home environment that supports children’s holistic development. Relationships and connections provide the cornerstone for developing confidence to enquire, investigate and explore. The manager acknowledges that it is timely to review the service's philosophy.</p><p>The service has received targeted support through the Ministry of Education funded programme, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO) during 2018. This support is to continue during 2019.</p><p>Butterfly Buddies Homebased Education was licensed by the Ministry of Education in 2017. This is its first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in a range of child-initiated experiences based on their interests and some adult-initiated ideas. Programme provision for infants focuses on nurturing their wellbeing through responsive caregiving. At times they join in playgroup or music sessions, organised trips and local community events.</p><p>Parents' input and feedback is encouraged. The use of an online tool to record children's learning experiences supports strengthening relationships between the education coordinator and whānau.</p><p>Leaders agree they need to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop parents' knowledge of learning that is occurring and encourage participation in their children’s programmes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support kaiako to identify and appropriately plan to meet parents' and whānau aspirations for their children. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Assessment practice needs improving. Kaiako require support to further develop recording of children's learning. The education coordinator's visit notes should include more ideas about how kaiako can assist with children's next development steps in their role as learning facilitators. A continued focus on helping kaiako understand and describe children’s learning should be further supported by the education coordinator.</p><p>The owner and education coordinator should continue to develop procedures for induction of new kaiako. They should include improved curriculum guidance and systems to support kaiako understanding and documenting of health and safety requirements. Continued improvement of these records is required to ensure kaiako understand service expectations and Ministry of Education regulatory requirements.</p><p>Promoting inclusive practices that are culturally responsive is highly evident. The owner and education coordinator should continue to develop clear expectations to support building capability and capacity for kaiako in te reo me ngā tikanga Māori.</p><p>Governance, management and leadership requires strengthening, particularly in relation to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>building the owner/manager's and education coordinator’s understanding and use of evaluation for improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring policy guidelines are up to date, signed off and reviewed in line with the service's schedule</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>revisiting the strategic plan to ensure that it guides centre operation, promotes improvement and sustainability and clearly aligns to the service's annual plan.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Appraisal is not satisfactory. The manager and education coordinator are not appraised and the process for kaiako is not improvement focused. Developing an appraisal approach that identifies priorities to strengthen leaders and kaiako professional growth, provides regular, constructive feedback and includes focused observations of practice is required.</p><p>Priorities for the network to improve outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation and use of this information to support a curriculum that appropriately challenges children's thinking and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the monitoring of systems and practices, particularly those for health and safety to track operational expectations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation for improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the appraisal system.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Butterfly Buddies Home Based Education completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implementing robust systems of regular appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the service provider taking all reasonable steps to ensure appropriate health and safety systems are in place and monitored</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation processes to improve outcomes for children.<br> <em>[Licensing criteria for Home-based Education and Care Services 2008, Regulation 46; GMA6, GMA7]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Butterfly Buddies Home Based Education. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>14 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework Ngā Pou Here:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services</p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed</li>
<li>Well placed</li>
<li>Requires further development</li>
<li>Not well placed</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
