</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bright Horizons is a new centre that operates in a residential area close to the central business district of Matamata. The centre is one of two centres in New Zealand that are owned and governed by Bright Horizons New Zealand Childcare Limited, an Australian owned private company.</p><p>This purpose-built centre is licensed for 75 children from 3 months to school age. At the time of this ERO review 68 children were enrolled, 11 of whom are of Māori descent. The centre is organised into three areas, nursery, kindy and preschool, each catering for up to 25 children.</p><p>Since opening in 2012 the centre has experienced significant staff changes. Staffing levels have now settled and a new centre director took up her position at the beginning of 2014.</p><p>The centre philosophy has been reviewed, with both teaching staff and parents contributing their ideas. This philosophy emphasises the importance of an inclusive and welcoming environment for children and families, where reciprocal relationships are developed through trust and respect.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Bright Horizons Matamata has made good progress since opening. It is well supported and managed by Bright Horizons New Zealand Childcare Ltd, who provide an appropriate range of policies and financial management practices to support and guide centre processes and organisation.</p><p>The regional manager provides focused guidance and leadership for the centre. She values centre staff participation and supports their professional growth. The appraisal process provides valuable opportunities for teachers to reflect on their practice. The regional manager has plans to further develop appraisal practice with a particular focus on observing and providing constructive feedback about teachers' work with children and families. These plans aim to further enhance teaching practice and outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre director is an experienced early childhood practitioner and mentor for beginning teachers, who expresses an understanding of, and commitment, to the vision and philosophy of the centre. Head teachers contribute a wide variety of experience, skills and knowledge to the leadership of their respective rooms.</p><p>Centre staff have benefitted from professional learning and development in self review. This has resulted in an increased understanding of self review. A systematic approach, spontaneous review in attending to emerging needs of children and families is established. Self review has improved responsiveness of programmes, learning environments and the service to children and their families.</p><p>A feature of the centre is the respectful and reciprocal relationships among staff, children and families. Management and staff also show a genuine commitment to respecting and acknowledging Māori as tangata whenua. There would be benefit in the centre developing some more specific goals and action plans for engaging with, and developing partnerships with, Māori whānau, their hapu and iwi.</p><p>The centre’s curriculum prioritises children becoming increasingly confident to make decisions and contribute, to develop a sense of self worth and to value others. Teachers have sound knowledge of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and the valuable learning that comes from programmes based on children's play, exploration and interests. Learning environments are well resourced and children are encouraged to use resources and equipment in creative and innovative ways. There will be benefit in teachers continuing to review and enhance these environments in response to children’s ages and agreed teaching approaches.</p><p>Teachers have an increasing emphasis on bringing the natural world into the centre environment and teaching aspects of tikanga Māori. This is closely aligned to the centre's approach to building bicultural practices among staff, children and families.</p><p>Interactions between teachers and children are affectionate and nurturing. Children are confident with adults and benefit from teachers skilled use of strategies that extend language, ideas and confidence as learners. Teachers promote social skills and encourage children’s independence and exploration.</p><p>Parents appreciate opportunities to share in their children’s learning and have access to assessment information through individual portfolios and electronic files. Teachers have worked hard to provide assessment records that capture children’s interests and learning dispositions.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers agree that to assist ongoing development of this new centre it will be important for:</p><ul>
<li>head teachers and their respective teams to develop more specific statements of practice that are closely aligned to the recently reviewed centre philosophy</li>
<li>the centre director, head teachers and teachers to engage in planned centre-wide professional learning and development to gain shared understanding and ownership of assessment, planning and evaluation processes and practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bright Horizons Matamata completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bright Horizons Matamata will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>14 March 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
