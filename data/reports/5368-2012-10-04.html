<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1.The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2>
<p>Northland Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p>All recommendations from the 2008 ERO report have been addressed. Property improvement has included development of the outdoor environment to accommodate children&rsquo;s gardens. Sustainability and the natural environment are emphasised. A large covered veranda and additional sunshade have been provided.</p>
<p>Children quickly become actively engaged in play of their own choosing. They demonstrate well developed cooperative and social skills. Sustained collaborative role play is a feature of the programme. Children show respect for each other. Caring, sharing and turn taking are highly evident.</p>
<p>Positive interactions between staff and children promote learning. Teachers are warm and nurturing. They provide encouragement, praise and extend learning as appropriate. Interactions often stimulate enquiry, problem solving and extend children&rsquo;s thinking.</p>
<p>The programme is clearly linked to Te Wh&#257;riki, and is based on children&rsquo;s emergent strengths and interests. Planning wall displays share past and current interests and learning with families and wh&#257;nau. These support learning, promote belonging and recall past and current experiences. Attractively presented individual portfolios provide a good record of each child&rsquo;s involvement in the programme.</p>
<p>Within the kindergarten, bicultural perspectives are strongly evident through displays, games, books, puzzles and artefacts. Pacific perspectives are also included. A rich and varied range of environments, encourage and extend learning both indoors and out. Natural resources reinforce sustainability and science concepts. Children are actively engaged in caring for and observing plants and animals.</p>
<p>Areas for development and review identified during this ERO review relate to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>consistency of practice when writing learning stories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further integrating the use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori into documentation and the teaching programme by all staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing and strengthening appraisal and self review processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Northland Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atNorthland Kindergarten.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p>
<ul><li>association support</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Since the previous ERO review Northland Kindergarten has reorganised its hours of operation and now has five, full-day sessions. Older children attend on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. Younger children attend on Tuesday and Friday.</p>
<p>The staff is a mix of experienced and new teachers. Three are provisionally registered. Staffing levels have increased as a result of the extended hours of operation.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>The emergent programme is clearly linked to Te Wh&#257;riki and is based on children&rsquo;s strengths and interests. Planning wall displays share past and current interests and learning with families and wh&#257;nau. Parent comments are encouraged and included. Dispositional focuses are also noted and shared with the wider community</p>
<p>At team meetings, teachers evaluate the learning of groups and individuals and note possible next steps. Staff meeting minutes record teachers sharing observations and discussing children&rsquo;s current interests. Processes have been established to ensure teachers record and share their assessment and evaluation of programme effectiveness.</p>
<p>Attractively presented individual portfolios provide a good record of each child&rsquo;s involvement in the programme. Children readily access these and enjoy revisiting their learning and achievements. Staff are beginning to use aspects of tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori in their planning and assessment.</p>
<p>The kindergarten philosophy is clearly evident in practice. Teachers use a range of effective teaching practices such as:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>questioning to promote discussion and extend play and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>playing alongside children to model use of resources and oral language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>actively encouraging and supporting literacy and mathematical skills and knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>positively affirming appropriate achievement, learning and social skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>naturally integrating music and movement into the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>listening and responding quickly to children&rsquo;s immediate and emerging interests.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children settle quickly to become actively engaged in play of their own choosing. They show strong cooperative and social skills. Sustained collaborative role play is a feature of the programme. Kindergarten routines are well understood by children and independence is encouraged. Children relate well, showing respect for each other. Caring, sharing and turn taking are highly evident.</p>
<p>Teachers incorporate aspects of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori into the programme, especially at hui times. Waiata and karakia are examples. At hui time teachers support children to speak in a large group situation. Bicultural perspectives are strongly evident through displays, games, books, puzzles and artefacts. Pacific perspectives are also included.</p>
<p>Within the kindergarten, well presented displays support learning, promote belonging and recall past and current experiences. A rich and varied range of environments encourage and extend learning both indoors and out. Use of natural resources and contexts reinforce sustainability and science concepts. Children are actively engaged in caring for, and observing, plants and animals. The community regularly contributes to resources, materials, development and maintenance of the environment to encourage children&rsquo;s engagement and exploration.</p>
<p>Positive interactions among staff and children promote learning. Teachers are warm and nurturing. Interactions with children are friendly, respectful and fun. Teachers provide encouragement, praise and extend learning as appropriate. Interactions often stimulate enquiry, problem solving and extend children&rsquo;s thinking.</p>
<p>Transition into, through and out of kindergarten is deliberately planned or facilitated. Transition to school is managed in close association with parents and local schools. Children with additional learning needs are given extra support. A tuakana teina buddy system is part of the transition process. Close professional relationships exist between educators and school new entrant teachers.</p>
<p>A distributive leadership style empowers team members to work together collaboratively sharing their strengths and skills.</p>
<h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p>Although information and communication technologies (ICT) are used for some learning, no shared philosophy or expectations about the role of ICT in programmes, learning and assessment has been developed. Teachers agree that this is a next step.</p>
<p>The staff have identified that they will:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>improve the quality and consistency of learning stories. While some high quality models are evident, the quality and depth of learning stories is variable. Showing links to children&rsquo;s previous learning and interests, including next learning steps and increasing child and parent comments is likely to strengthen consistency and quality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop ways to further integrate and consolidate the use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori into documentation and the teaching programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use more in-depth evaluative questions and criteria to measure and evaluate the impact of changes and developments to further strengthen self review processes. The association process is well implemented.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation supports these findings.</p>
<h3>Association Support</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p>
<p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p>
<p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy <em>Te Manawa</em>: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through <em>Te&nbsp;Manawa</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a wide range of professional development opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice, as a result of feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Northland Kindergarten completed an ERO andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:<span>Centre Management Assurance Statement</span></p>
<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>

<p>To the Parents and Community of Northland Kindergarten</p>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Northland Kindergarten.</p>
<p>Northland Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p>All recommendations from the 2008 ERO report have been addressed. Property improvement has included development of the outdoor environment to accommodate children&rsquo;s gardens. Sustainability and the natural environment are emphasised. A large covered veranda and additional sunshade have been provided.</p>
<p>Children quickly become actively engaged in play of their own choosing. They demonstrate well developed cooperative and social skills. Sustained collaborative role play is a feature of the programme. Children show respect for each other. Caring, sharing and turn taking are highly evident.</p>
<p>Positive interactions between staff and children promote learning. Teachers are warm and nurturing. They provide encouragement, praise and extend learning as appropriate. Interactions often stimulate enquiry, problem solving and extend children&rsquo;s thinking.</p>
<p>The programme is clearly linked to Te Wh&#257;riki, and is based on children&rsquo;s emergent strengths and interests. Planning wall displays share past and current interests and learning with families and wh&#257;nau. These support learning, promote belonging and recall past and current experiences. Attractively presented individual portfolios provide a good record of each child&rsquo;s involvement in the programme.</p>
<p>Within the kindergarten, bicultural perspectives are strongly evident through displays, games, books, puzzles and artefacts. Pacific perspectives are also included. A rich and varied range of environments, encourage and extend learning both indoors and out. Natural resources reinforce sustainability and science concepts. Children are actively engaged in caring for and observing plants and animals.</p>
<p>Areas for development and review identified during this ERO review relate to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>consistency of practice when writing learning stories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further integrating the use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori into documentation and the teaching programme by all staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing and strengthening appraisal and self review processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p>
<p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
