<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>This playcentre operates from purpose-built facilities next door to the local school. It operates five mornings a week and has children of varying ages and from a growing range of ethnic backgrounds. The playcentre&rsquo;s roll has grown significantly over the last two years, with over 50 families now involved.</p><p>The playcentre is one of ten parent-led centres that operate under the umbrella of the Buller Westland Playcentre Association. The association provides policy direction for centre operations, as well as administrative services and quality management. Office holders, along with fieldworkers, provide professional advice and support to centres.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in March 2008, there have been significant changes in office holders, ongoing parent training and professional development. Team leaders and parents have successfully maintained and built on the many good practices noted during this review.</p><p>This playcentre provides children with good quality education and care. Its operation clearly reflects its philosophy.</p><p>Particular features of the centre&rsquo;s programme include:</p><ul>
<li>the wide variety of learning experiences children take part in and the quality of its facilities and resources</li>
<li>the significant opportunities children have to build on their interests and engage in creative play for long periods</li>
<li>the quality of relationships and interactions between parents and children, and how well children&rsquo;s sense of well-being and belonging is fostered</li>
<li>the way in which parents are actively involved in supporting their children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><p>The playcentre is well led and managed. Delegation holders perform their roles well. Their enthusiasm and teamwork foster a positive culture. Their reflective practices, along with a strong focus on ongoing centre improvement, means the playcentre is in a strong position to continue to develop.</p><p>The areas for development and review agreed to by the playcentre management and ERO focus on building on the best of some current practices to further enhance the quality of education for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kaniere Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKaniere Playcentre.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Office holders, team leaders and parents have continued to develop the centre&rsquo;s programme and practices. They demonstrate a strong ongoing commitment to making sure the that education and care children receive is consistent with the playcentre&rsquo;s philosophy.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4>Programme</h4><p>The centre provides children with a good quality educational programme. Particular features of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>the extensive range of learning experiences provided for children, and the way in which they engage in sustained, creative play</li>
<li>well-established and collaboratively developed programme plans for individual children and the way Te Wh&#257;raki, New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum is integrated into plans</li>
<li>the strong focus placed on responding to children&rsquo;s interests and needs</li>
<li>assessments that are based on a range of information and the use made of these to clarify children&rsquo;s progress, foster their interests and support their learning.</li>
</ul><h4>Interactions</h4><p>ERO observed team leaders and parents relate to children in ways that were supportive, respectful and responsive. Their interactions were helping to foster children&rsquo;s sense of well-being and belonging. Children played cooperatively and were supportive of one another.</p><p>Parents actively involve themselves in children&rsquo;s play. They recognise children&rsquo;s interests and actively look for opportunities to help foster these. Their interactions make sure that children are provided with, and supported in, making choices. Children were observed involving themselves in a variety of activities for prolonged periods.</p><h4>Environment</h4><p>The playcentre environment is well maintained, attractive and inviting. Team leaders and parents make good use of the space available to provide children with a wide range of well-presented activities.</p><p>A spacious and well-developed outdoor area provides children with plenty of activities that challenge them and encourage exploration.</p><p>Children have ready access to, and make good use of, a varied range of resources.</p><h4>Leadership and management</h4><p>This playcentre is well managed and led. Office holders work towards clear priorities. Systems of delegations make good use of parents&rsquo; personal strengths. Teamwork is fostered through centre practices.</p><p>Team leaders and office holders:</p><ul>
<li>are clear about their responsibilities</li>
<li>work cooperatively towards common goals</li>
<li>take into account the need for succession planning</li>
<li>support and encourage parent training.</li>
</ul><p>A reflective culture exists within playcentre personnel, along with a strong commitment to ongoing centre improvement. This culture is supported by some well developed self-review practices. For example, team leaders are currently considering how best to respond to a recent parent survey that identified the need to further recognise children&rsquo;s cultural heritage.</p><p>Team leaders and office holders foster strong links with their community. This has helped to raise the profile of the playcentre within the community and led to an increase in the centre&rsquo;s roll.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><h4>Enhancing centre practices</h4><p>The playcentre management and ERO agree that developments in these areas would help to enhance the centre programme. They include:</p><ul>
<li>extending group programme planning and evaluation practices</li>
<li>continuing efforts to extend parents&rsquo; roles in assessing and analysing children&rsquo;s progress and clarifying their next learning steps</li>
<li>building on recent efforts to focus self-review more on evaluating the quality of education provided for children</li>
<li>further promoting children&rsquo;s learning and independence.</li>
</ul><p>Team leaders and parents could enhance children&rsquo;s learning by:</p><ul>
<li>exploring ways of fostering greater consistency in the use of child-centred teaching across centre sessions</li>
<li>making greater use of conversations and questioning to challenge children, extending their thinking and developing their problem-solving skills.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Kaniere Playcentre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practice the managers should:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>extend the risk management procedures for the trips and outings they involve children in.</p>
</li>
</ol><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>About the Centre</p><table>

</table><p>30 May 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kaniere-playcentre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kaniere Playcentre</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kaniere Playcentre.</p><p>This playcentre operates from purpose-built facilities next door to the local school. It operates five mornings a week and has children of varying ages and from a growing range of ethnic backgrounds. The playcentre&rsquo;s roll has grown significantly over the last two years, with over 50 families now involved.</p><p>The playcentre is one of ten parent-led centres that operate under the umbrella of the Buller Westland Playcentre Association. The association provides policy direction for centre operations, as well as administrative services and quality management. Office holders, along with fieldworkers, provide professional advice and support to centres.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in March 2008, there have been significant changes in office holders, ongoing parent training and professional development. Team leaders and parents have successfully maintained and built on the many good practices noted during this review.</p><p>This playcentre provides children with good quality education and care. Its operation clearly reflects its philosophy.</p><p>Particular features of the centre&rsquo;s programme include:</p><ul>
<li>the wide variety of learning experiences children take part in and the quality of its facilities and resources</li>
<li>the significant opportunities children have to build on their interests and engage in creative play for long periods</li>
<li>the quality of relationships and interactions between parents and children, and how well children&rsquo;s sense of well-being and belonging is fostered</li>
<li>the way in which parents are actively involved in supporting their children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><p>The playcentre is well led and managed. Delegation holders perform their roles well. Their enthusiasm and teamwork foster a positive culture. Their reflective practices, along with a strong focus on ongoing centre improvement, means the playcentre is in a strong position to continue to develop.</p><p>The areas for development and review agreed to by the playcentre management and ERO focus on building on the best of some current practices to further enhance the quality of education for children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p></html>
