</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Onerahi Playcentre is situated on the outskirts of Whangarei and operates as a parent cooperative. Centre practices are based on the Playcentre philosophy of families learning and growing together. Families from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds attend the playcentre. It is licensed for thirty children from birth to school age and offers three sessions per week, with up to twenty-three children attending one or more of these sessions.</p><p>Two out of the three sessions are run independently by centre course holders. However the future of the Wednesday session is uncertain. Session numbers are low and the Association support worker often attends sessions to provide the necessary course level qualifications to meet licensing requirements. Higher rates of attendance and levels of training would permit members to run a funded session each Wednesday.</p><p>The 2010 ERO report recommended that members should strengthen the use of self review to help inform ongoing improvements to centre operations, including programme assessment and planning practices. Centre members continue to be supported by the Northland Playcentre Association to undertake planned self review. The playcentre has been relicensed under the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008 since the 2010 ERO review.</p><p>The centre operates as part of the Northland Playcentre Association. The Association is the umbrella organisation for twenty-three playcentres. Many of these centres are rural or semi-rural with a high turnover of membership. The association manages and distributes centre funding and provides a training programme for parents/whānau to achieve playcentre qualifications. An association Centre Support Worker assists centre members where necessary. The Association has reviewed ways to make courses more manageable and accessible for rural members and has implemented a ‘course two in a term’ initiative.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four playcentre reviews in the Northland Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Onerahi Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children. Playcentre membership is made up of volunteer parents. There has been a major turnover of office holders, with many of the positions currently being left vacant. A small core of members share leadership roles and manage the playcentre at a very basic level. Consideration is being given by centre members as to how they might share the vacant president's role between two members.</p><p>Generally children are settled in the programme. They engage in activities alongside their parents/caregivers. However, most families attend one of three sessions and are relatively unknown to each other. The quality of the programme could now be raised by members getting to know each other better and working collaboratively together. Opportunities should also be provided for children to develop relationships with other adults and friendships with other children. Interactions between adults and children should be focused on extending children’s strengths and interests.</p><p>The programme caters mostly for children under 3 years of age. Many older children leave to attend kindergarten as a way of preparing for their transition to school. It would be useful for members to continue to review the programme with a view to providing more stimulating sessions that challenge older children’s learning. This might also help to retain older children at the playcentre.</p><p>The programme is mainly based around the provision of activities. Parents take responsibility for their own children’s involvement in the programme and for recording their experiences in individual profiles. Ongoing support from the association should help members to learn how to plan for and assess children’s learning.</p><p>Commitment to promoting a bicultural partnership with Māori whānau is evident in the Northland Playcentre Association policies and procedures. The association has developed Te Roopu Whakaaro Kotahi as a forum to support whānau Maori in Playcentres. However, bicultural practices now need to be further strengthened. The New Zealand Playcentre Association’s Te Tiriti O Waitangi Framework could be used to promote ongoing development if Association support is to impact authentically on bicultural practices in Northland Association Playcentres.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to better provide positive learning outcomes for children, centre members should work with the association to:</p><ul>
<li>support newer members in the implementation of the playcentre philosophy</li>
<li>grow the leadership and management skills of centre members</li>
<li>develop effective child-focused planning , assessment and evaluation processes</li>
<li>develop a culture of ongoing self review to improve practices</li>
</ul><p>strengthen strategic and annual plans to guide the playcentre’s short and long-term direction.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Northland Playcentre Association continues to work closely with Onerahi Playcentre members to support existing members and attract and retain new members.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Onerahi Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Onerahi Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>14 March 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
