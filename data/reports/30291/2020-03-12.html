</table><p>Impressions Childcare Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Impressions Childcare Centre is a large, privately owned, full-day, education and care service located in the rural village of Pirongia. The centre operates four aged-based rooms with separate outdoor spaces. It is licensed for 143 children including 40 children aged up to two years. The current roll of 144 children includes 26 children who identify as Māori and several children from a range of ethnic groups.</p><p>The centre manager and team leaders together manage and lead centre operations. The philosophy promotes trusting and reciprocal relationships in an environment where meaningful responses empower children and adults.</p><p>Since the September 2016 evaluation, management and teachers have undertaken professional development to further their knowledge and understanding of bicultural practices and some of the strategic priorities for the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience positive interactions with their teachers. Literacy, mathematics and science are naturally integrated throughout the programme. Babies and toddlers benefit from routines that are responsive to their individual preferences and needs. Children are given time and space to lead their own learning in a calm and settled environment. Strong relationships with the local school and the key teacher approach support children to transition positively into, within the centre and on to school. Children with additional needs are supported through individualised planning and responsive practice. A strong sense of belonging and wellbeing is evident for children in a family-based environment.</p><p>Purposeful learning experiences promote positive learning outcomes for children. Parents' views and aspirations for their children are gathered and used in individualised planning and assessment of learning. Children's learning progress is visible in their individual portfolios. The age-based learning environments are attractive, well-resourced and intentionally planned by teachers to invite children to explore. Children are supported to build their knowledge about New Zealand’s unique cultural heritage through the use of te reo Māori in context with learning experiences. Teachers should further strengthen ways for multi-cultural families, including Pacific to relate to their culture and identity within the centre. The centre philosophy is highly evident in relationships, the curriculum and teachers' practice. Children enjoy learning in meaningful contexts.</p><p>Leaders promote a positive culture of teaching and learning. Teachers participate in regular professional learning and development. Leaders promote responsive and reflective practice. There is effective and regular communication between leaders, teaching teams and parents on the progress and development of their child. Emergent leadership is encouraged. Teachers feel well supported in their role.</p><p>Internal evaluation is valued and leads to improved outcomes for children. Policies and systems have been developed to guide centre operations. There is a need for management to take a strategic approach to centre operations including a more robust review of policies. The current appraisal process requires strengthening. Priority should now be given to support teachers to strengthen their knowledge of the <em>New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum</em>, <em>Te Whāriki</em>. The centre's annual goals are identified and now need further development to align the centre's strategic direction.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps for Impressions Childcare Centre managers are to strengthen the:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>appraisal process, including observations of teaching practice to build the capability of teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leadership of learning to keep up with current research practices and the revised New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>alignment of the strategic and annual plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>robustness of policy review.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Impressions Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to health and safety. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>include earth quake and lock down drills as part of regular emergency drills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>accident records to include evidence that parents have been informed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to ensure that excursion documentation includes adult-to-child ratios on the parental permission approval document.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><i>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS8, HS27, HS17]</i></p><p>In order to improve practice, the service should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>undertake regular review of policies and procedures to meet current legal requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Darcy Te Hau</p><p>Acting Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region - Te Tai Pūtahi Nui</span></p><p>12 March 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
