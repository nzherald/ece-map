</table><p>PAUA Poppetts 1&nbsp;is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>PAUA Early Childhood Home-based Education and Care service is privately owned and includes 13 networks that provide home-based education and care throughout New Zealand. PAUA Poppetts Early Childhood Home-based Education and Care service is part of the wider PAUA networks. At the time of this education review, no children were enrolled.</p><p>Several options for education and care are provided by PAUA. These include education and care in educators&rsquo; or family educator homes and a nanny service. PAUA's mission statement and core values state, &lsquo;children are at the heart of all we do&rsquo;. The service philosophy is based on Christian values and gives priority to building relationships at all levels of the organisation.</p><p>The director/owner has oversight of all PAUA operations. An education team leader oversees teaching and learning. PAUA peer leaders, who are experienced visiting teachers, mentor smaller teams of visiting teachers. Visiting teachers are qualified early childhood teachers who visit children and support educators in the home.</p><p>The key next steps for development from the June 2016 ERO education review included: strengthening strategic planning and evaluation; and formalising teacher appraisal and developing appraisal policy and procedures. Progress is evident in appraisal practices. Strategic planning and internal evaluation continue to require strengthening.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three home-based education and care networks in the PAUA Poppetts Early Childhood Home-based Education and Care service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The organisation's philosophy guides the service and is evident in practice across the organisation. Whanaungatanga has been a priority and is currently being reviewed across the organisation. Leadership across the service promotes a positive organisational culture based on relational trust and respect. There are multiple on-line platforms that facilitate communication and collaboration. Well-established guidelines for service leadership, visiting teachers' and educators' practice are in place.</p><p>The appraisal process supports teacher development. Internal and external professional development suitably links to appraisal goals. Continuing to strengthen the appraisal process to more clearly focus on outcomes for children's learning is a next step.</p><p>An efficient framework is in place to support visiting teachers and educators to notice, recognise and respond to children's interests and strengths. The role of the visiting teacher is clearly defined and includes coordinating a variety of learning opportunities based on <em>Te Wh&#257;riki 2017.</em> A strong focus is placed on inclusive practices, positive relationships and wellbeing for children and their families.</p><p>Annual planning and review of the organisation's annual goals suitably guides service operations. Management and governance systems and practices monitor regulatory compliance and promote positive outcomes for children&rsquo;s learning. The director provides effective oversight across all network operations.</p><p>Strategic planning has recently been introduced to guide the organisation and to monitor progress towards long term goals. Embedding and strengthening components of strategic planning are required. There is a need to strengthen strategic goals to better focus on positive learning outcomes for children and to develop systematic internal evaluation practices.</p><p>PAUA have effective systems and processes in place should children enrol in this service.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps for governance and management is to develop strategic evaluation practices that enable the organisation to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>define strategic goals with a stronger focus on positive outcomes for children's learning and to monitor achievement towards meeting these goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement practices to gather evidence that enables management and leaders to analyse progress towards achieving strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide more opportunities for parents and wh&#257;nau to contribute to the service's direction and vision.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of PAUA Poppetts 1 completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>11 December 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
