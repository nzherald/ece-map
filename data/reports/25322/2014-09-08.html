</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fetufa Tokelau Akoga Kamata Early Childhood Centre was established in 2006. It provides education and care for babies and children up to school age. The community based centre promotes and supports the Tokelau language and culture. This is integrated within a Christian based programme.</p><p>The centre’s founding members continue to provide active support the centre. The board of governors is made up of eight members from the Tokelau community. They include parent representatives and uluhina Tokelau/elders. Board members are well experienced and skilled in business management.</p><p>The centre manager is qualified and experienced. She leads a team of five qualified staff and oversees the daily operations and administration of the akoga kamata.</p><p><em>Te Whariki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, guides teachers’ planning to promote positive outcomes for children’s learning and development.</p><p>The 2011 ERO report identified children’s strong sense of belonging in the akoga. This was achieved through a supportive and inclusive family environment. These positive features continue to be evident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre’s warm, welcoming and caring environment helps children to settle quickly into the programme. Children are confident and are friendly to visitors and each other.</p><p>Children are involved in a range of activities provided by teachers. Older children make choices and confidently direct their own play and learning. Some children competently speak and respond in their home language. Children are supported to be culturally confident learners.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are included in the wider programme which provides them with rich experiences. Routines are flexible and organised around children’s needs. A separate room for babies and toddlers is used for uninterrupted play and exploration. Children benefit from the well designed new outdoor playground that promotes a variety of challenges.</p><p>Teachers speak in Pacific languages to communicate with children from the different Pacific Island communities. They value the place te reo and tikanga Māori has in the programme. Teachers recognise that they need to further develop their bicultural practices.</p><p>Strong parent relationships are a key feature of the akoga. Positive, respectful relationships between parents and children are evident. Teachers’ interactions with children are consistently responsive and sensitive. This provides good support for children’s learning.</p><p>Teachers continue to develop skills for critical reflection on their practice. They should now review the quality of centre programmes and resources in more depth to further enrich provisions for children’s learning. Better visibility and accessibility of assessment and programme planning information would enable children and their parents to revisit learning experiences and to see how the programme develops over time.</p><p>The centre is managed effectively. Regular, well documented meetings contribute to decision making. A clear and useful procedural base has been established to guide practice. A five year strategic plan has been developed to guide centre strategic direction. Staff are well supported to continually improve their professional knowledge and practice both individually and as a group. Fetufa Tokelau Akoga Kamata Early Childhood Centre is well positioned to make ongoing improvements for the benefit of children and their community.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre managers agree that next steps to support ongoing review and improvement should include:</p><ul>
<li>developing a robust process for self review that involves teachers, whānau and children, and focuses on educational opportunities and outcomes for children</li>
<li>consultation with teachers, parents and whānau to develop a long-term strategic planning that clearly sets out relevant goals with appropriate actions and time frames identified</li>
<li>implementing the newly structured appraisal process, with a stronger focus on appraisal goals that improve, support and continue to extend teachers’ professional practice and knowledge</li>
<li>strengthening teachers’ capacity to integrate Tokelau language and culture into the programme and teaching practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that teachers increase the level of Tokelau language spoken to better meet the vision of the akoga kamata. It would be appropriate to consult the parent community to gauge the level of support for full immersion delivery.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fetufa Tokelau Akoga Kamata Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Fetufa Tokelau Akoga Kamata Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>8 September 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
