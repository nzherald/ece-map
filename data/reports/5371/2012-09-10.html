<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p align="left">Papakowhai Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p align="left">At Papakowhai Kindergarten high quality interactions noted in the 2009 ERO report have been sustained. Teachers are warm, caring, responsive and nurturing. Children are very involved in planting and caring for the environment. They are considerate, helpful, respectful and care for one another. Teachers support children&rsquo;s development through three virtues, caring and sharing, friendship and courage. Interest and engagement in self-chosen play is well sustained.</p>
<p align="left">Planning is well presented to wh&#257;nau in wall displays that reflect Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers document emergent interests, dispositions and skills to inform group planning and respond to these with appropriate resources and teaching strategies. Bicultural threads are effectively included in planning as are other cultural perspectives.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers use a wide range of effective teaching strategies. These include good use of questioning to promote discussion and extend play, playing alongside children to model play and the use of resources. Educators respond quickly to children&rsquo;s immediate interests.</p>
<p align="left">The teaching team know each other and the children well. This knowledge is used to create a positive learning environment for all. A calm tone is evident throughout the day. Partnerships with wh&#257;nau and parents are positive.</p>
<p align="left">The well-maintained and presented learning environment is arranged with care to display bicultural perspectives. Centre virtues are celebrated throughout the kindergarten, and are visible in displays and resources. The outdoor environment supports exploration, physical challenge and development.</p>
<p align="left">This ERO review identifies that increasing children&rsquo;s and parent&rsquo;s contributions to learning stories and including comments relevant to M&#257;ori and other cultures is likely to enhance partnerships.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p align="left">Before the review, the management of Papakowhai Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atPapakowhai Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p>
<ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p align="left"><span>Since the May 2008 ERO review, the kindergarten has extended its hours of operation and re organised session times. Older children now attend Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays while younger children attend Wednesdays and Thursdays.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>The experienced teaching team has worked together since January, 2010. Committee and association funding have allowed administrative support to be increased to 12 hours per week.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>All recommendations from the previous ERO report have been addressed. Property improvement has included building a large covered deck and redevelopment of the teachers&rsquo; office into a quiet writing space for children.</span></p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p align="left">Planning is thoughtfully presented to wh&#257;nau in wall displays that reflect Te Wh&#257;riki. The notice, recognise and respond aspects of Kei Tua o te Pae are clearly evident in planning. Two additional dimensions, reflecting and revisiting, contribute to high quality evaluation of the programme. <em>Te Manawa</em>, the association criteria for curriculum implementation, effectively supports staff to document the process of planning, learning and evaluation of children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers document emergent interests, dispositions and skills to inform group planning and respond with appropriate resources and teaching strategies. Bicultural threads are effectively included in planning as are other cultures perspectives. Individual children&rsquo;s needs are discussed and provided for.</p>
<p align="left">Learning stories show indepth analysis and children&rsquo;s development of learning over time. Stories reflect teachers&rsquo; observations and their knowledge of the children. Teachers regularly review learning stories to ensure that they adequately capture children&rsquo;s learning. There are frequent links between stories.</p>
<p align="left">The programme provides opportunities for children to investigate, express ideas and extend their knowledge and skills. Games, books, puzzles and writing experiences promote early literacy learning and investigation of mathematical and scientific ideas. Appropriate materials and experiences also support play and development in these areas. Bicultural perspectives are thoroughly embedded, with many children confident to share their mihi and take part in waiata and karakia. Children confidently use technology such as computers, photocopiers, laminators and cameras with assistance from teachers.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers use a wide range of effective teaching strategies including:</p>
<ul>
<li>questioning to promote discussion and extend play</li>
<li>playing and working alongside children</li>
<li>modelling play, oral language and use of resources</li>
<li>responding quickly to children&rsquo;s immediate interests</li>
<li>promoting problem solving</li>
<li>enthusiastically engaging with individuals and groups</li>
<li>using positive behaviour strategies to direct children&rsquo;s focus to their learning and promoting new play choices.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">High quality interactions noted in ERO&rsquo;s previous report have been sustained. Teachers are warm, caring, responsive and nurturing.</p>
<p align="left">Children are:</p>
<ul>
<li>involved in planting and caring for the environment</li>
<li>considerate, helpful and respectful and care for one another. They are supported in their friendships to develop empathy through the virtues of caring/sharing, friendship and courage</li>
<li>sustaining interest and engagement in self-chosen play.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">The well maintained and presented learning environment is arranged with care to display bicultural perspectives. Agreed virtues are celebrated throughout the kindergarten, are visible in displays and resources. The outdoor environment encourages exploration and physical challenge and development.</p>
<p align="left">Staff know each other and the children well. They use this knowledge to create a positive learning environment for all. A calm tone is evident throughout the day. Partnerships with wh&#257;nau and parents are positive. Teachers make themselves available for informal exchanges of information about dispositions, interests and aspirations. Educators develop specific strategies to ensure they address these.</p>
<p align="left">The kindergarten has good relationships with the adjacent school. Transition is supported by displays showing photographs of new entrant teachers in their teaching spaces, with relevant accompanying information for parents.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers have a good understanding of how to use self review as a tool for improvement. This is evident in planned and spontaneous reviews. Effective use of the association framework examines practice and issues that promote positive outcomes for teachers and children.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p align="left">While learning stories show good quality analysis and record children&rsquo;s learning over time, they would be further strengthened by increasing children&rsquo;s input. Teachers should also explore ways to increase parent contributions.</p>
<p align="left">Although many stories incorporate comments relevant to M&#257;ori and other cultures, extending this practice for all children is likely to progress bicultural partnership.</p>
<h3>Association Support</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p align="left">The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p>
<p align="left">Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p>
<p align="left">The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p align="left">The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</li>
<li>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</li>
<li>a wide range of professional development opportunities</li>
<li>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p align="left">The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</li>
<li>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice as a result of feedback</li>
<li>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association strategic priorities.</li>
</ul>
<a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Papakowhai Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>

<p align="left">To the Parents and Community of Papakowhai Kindergarten</p>
<p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Papakowhai Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">Papakowhai Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p align="left">At Papakowhai Kindergarten high quality interactions noted in the 2009 ERO report have been sustained. Teachers are warm, caring, responsive and nurturing. Children are very involved in planting and caring for the environment. They are considerate, helpful, respectful and care for one another. Teachers support children&rsquo;s development through three virtues, caring and sharing, friendship and courage. Interest and engagement in self-chosen play is well sustained.</p>
<p align="left">Planning is well presented to wh&#257;nau in wall displays that reflect Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers document emergent interests, dispositions and skills to inform group planning and respond to these with appropriate resources and teaching strategies. Bicultural threads are effectively included in planning as are other cultural perspectives.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers use a wide range of effective teaching strategies. These include good use of questioning to promote discussion and extend play, playing alongside children to model play and the use of resources. Educators respond quickly to children&rsquo;s immediate interests.</p>
<p align="left">The teaching team know each other and the children well. This knowledge is used to create a positive learning environment for all. A calm tone is evident throughout the day. Partnerships with wh&#257;nau and parents are positive.</p>
<p align="left">The well-maintained and presented learning environment is arranged with care to display bicultural perspectives. Centre virtues are celebrated throughout the kindergarten, and are visible in displays and resources. The outdoor environment supports exploration, physical challenge and development.</p>
<p align="left">This ERO review identifies that increasing children&rsquo;s and parent&rsquo;s contributions to learning stories and including comments relevant to M&#257;ori and other cultures is likely to enhance partnerships.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
