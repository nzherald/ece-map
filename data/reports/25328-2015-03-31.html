</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bear Park Herne Bay Early Childhood Education Centre is a privately owned franchise that operates with the support of Bear Park Franchise Systems Limited. The Bear Park management group provides systems, policies, support and guidance to ensure consistent franchise practices. The new owner works collaboratively with centre supervisors and Bear Park support personnel to ensure the smooth day-to-day running of the centre.</p><p>The centre provides good quality education and care for children from three months to five years of age. The centre is licensed for 75 children who are representative of the predominantly New Zealand European/Pākehā, and Chinese communities. A small number of children from a small range of additional ethnicities also attend.</p><p>Children interact in age-related groups in four separate rooms and two shared playgrounds. While all teachers have some leadership roles within each of the rooms, two supervisors oversee the management of programmes.</p><p>The Bear Park philosophy links <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and aspects of Reggio Emilia learning approaches to guide teachers’ thinking about education and care for children. The centre’s vision is focused on positive outcomes for children and developing partnerships between families and teachers.</p><p>The service was previously comprised of two centres: a centre for infants and toddlers and a centre for preschoolers. In 2013 it was relicensed as one centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the attractive and well resourced centre. Staff greet children with enthusiasm and support them to settle into the programme. Children talk freely with teachers and other children, sharing their thinking and ideas about their interests.</p><p>Babies and toddlers are relaxed and confidently initiate interactions with adults. Respectful conversations promote children’s confidence, self esteem and trust in teachers. The programme supports their general development, emotional wellbeing and emerging language.</p><p>Teachers have developed partnerships with families. They gather information from parents about their children’s interests and backgrounds. Teachers know about each child and keep each other updated about children’s interests within centre and at home. A parent group meets regularly to contribute to the centre planning.</p><p>Staff manage children’s transition into the centre in carefully considered ways. Children’s transitions to school are also well supported. Literacy, mathematics and natural science are woven through programmes. Children’s social competence and independence is promoted. There are frequent opportunities for parents to learn about the values and learning intentions held by teachers.</p><p>The influence of Reggio Emilia approaches to learning are clearly evident in the purposeful environment, which is focused on sustainable living and recycling. The learning environment invites children’s exploration and discoveries. Local excursions and subsequent discussions help children to investigate their community and the wider world.</p><p>The programme achieves respectful learning partnerships between parents, children and teachers. Information communication technologies (ICT) are used to promote regular conversations between teachers and parents about children’s learning experiences and progress. Teachers and parents maintain very good documentation about learning in children’s ‘about me’ books, daily diaries and portfolios journals.</p><p>There is a strong emphasis on supporting children’s development as individual thinkers and learners, and on encouraging them to learn how to participate in small group discussions. Children’s learning dispositions are recognised and are well supported.</p><p>Although few Māori children attend the centre, teachers recognise the importance of all children learning about New Zealand’s bicultural heritage. Professional development is enabling teachers to build their use of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori in the programme. Staff plan to further enhance bicultural practice by researching the local history of tangata whenua /iwi.</p><p>Management practices are efficient and effective. The Bear Park franchise systems, frameworks and policies are well developed and regularly reviewed. Teachers receive regular professional learning and guidance to help them to review and develop teaching practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for the centre include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>increase the focus on understanding Māori culture, identity and language</li>
<li>explore ways to promote and affirm child-initiated play to further enrich learning opportunities.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bear Park Herne Bay Early Childhood Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3><span>Next ERO Review</span></h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bear Park Herne Bay Early Childhood Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer-Northern Northern Region</p><p>31 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
