</table><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Greymouth is very well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Greymouth is one of 71 early learning services governed and managed by Canterbury Westland Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens. The kindergarten caters for the education and care of young children from a wide geographical area.</p><p>During this review, the kindergarten was temporarily based in a local church, due to the need for the strengthening and upgrading of the permanent kindergarten building. The kindergarten will be reopened and fully functional, on the original site, at the beginning of Term 1 2017.</p><p>All teachers are fully qualified and certified in early childhood education. The association has provided an extra teacher to support the staff and children while they are in temporary premises.</p><p>There have been some changes to leadership over the last two years. The impact of this has been minimised by the permanent, skilled teachers providing quality leadership during times of change. The use of experienced itinerant teachers is also helping to support continuity of staffing and relationships at the kindergarten. The association education service manager (ESM) provides consistent professional advice and guidance to support the effective operation of the service.</p><p>Since the ERO review in 2012, the manager and teaching team have continued to sustain and build on best practices and share these with the wider kindergarten community.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine kindergartens governed and managed by the Canterbury Westland Free Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children, parents and whānau are warmly welcomed and well supported to make a positive transition into kindergarten and on to school. The teaching team place an important emphasis on developing positive, reciprocal relationships with tamariki, parents and whānau. Teachers value children’s home languages, cultures and identities. They make meaningful connections with families and foster a good sense of wellbeing and belonging at the kindergarten.</p><p>Teachers have developed a reflective team culture that is innovative in their approach to change. They demonstrate a 'can do' attitude as they adapt teaching practices and create purposeful learning spaces for children. Teachers promote a deep appreciation for the local area and people. They work in respectful ways with the local community including people from the host church, where they are currently based, and the local school.</p><p>Teachers model care and respect for one another and for children and families. They encourage children to be:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>confident and independent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>involved in decision making, planning and assessing their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>responsible for the care of others and the environment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children are actively involved in expressive art, literacy experiences, physical challenges, and opportunities to construct and represent their ideas over time. Bicultural perspectives are integrated in ways that are respectful of the Māori culture and meaningful for children.</p><p>Teachers work closely with children to engage them in learning and to promote their curiosity and creativity. Children benefit from deliberate acts of teaching, thoughtful interactions and questioning that helps to extend on their ideas and oral language skills.</p><p>Parents are well informed about their children's learning through well-written learning records. Teachers are making increasingly good use of <em>Te Whatu Pōkeka</em> (Māori assessment document) to support the assessment and learning for Māori children, as Māori.</p><p>A comprehensive systematic internal evaluation process focuses on improving children’s learning opportunities and teaching practices. It is well led and used by all teachers.</p><p>The Canterbury Westland Free Kindergarten Association is well supported by an experienced professional board. The association has a well-understood vision and targeted strategic and annual plans. There are close links between the kindergarten plans, internal evaluation, appraisal and professional development. Teachers are well supported by association managers and leaders to achieve the priorities of the association and their own kindergarten objectives and vision, to provide high quality learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>The association has a very strong commitment to providing high quality professional development to build on leadership capacity and teacher capability. It has high expectations for teaching and learning and equitable outcomes for all children. This includes the appointment of a kaitautoko to further promote a strong focus on Tiriti aspirations at all levels of the organisation.</p><p>The Canterbury Westland Free Kindergarten Association is innovative in its approaches and regularly seeks opportunities to be involved in the wider educational and local communities to promote high quality learning outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The education service manager and teaching team have identified, and ERO’s evaluation has confirmed, that the key next steps are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the way teachers evaluate practices that engage and extend children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the use of te reo Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the consolidation and embedding of new initiatives, including appraisal.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The chief executive has identified and ERO’s evaluation has confirmed, that the key next step for the association is to continue its property improvement long-term plan, ensuring that enhancement to its buildings reflect the changing needs of its communities.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Greymouth completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to: </p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Greymouth will be in four years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer, Southern - Te Waipounamu</p><p>21 March 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
