</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>An-Nur Childcare Centre Dunedin opened in April 2014 and is located in South Dunedin. It is the only Muslim-based centre in Dunedin. The centre offers education and care for Muslim and non-Muslim children from birth to school age. The roll is steadily increasing.</p><p>The centre priorities are to uphold Islamic traditions, nurture the whole child (spirit, mind and body), and develop children’s knowledge of Arabic language. These priorities are strongly evident in the programme. </p><p>The children and their teachers come from diverse cultural and language backgrounds. This diversity is valued. In addition, teachers encourage children to be confident in New Zealand's culture. For most children English is their second language. The centre is an important point of social contact for parents, especially those new to New Zealand. Teachers also provide practical support for families.</p><p>This centre is one of two centres under the Al Noor Charitable Trust. A sister centre based in Christchurch has been operating since 2000. The Christchurch-based manager visits regularly. </p><p>This is the centre’s first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s wellbeing is nurtured. The teachers know the children and their families well and have established caring and trusting relationships with them. The children play and learn in a settled atmosphere. Routines are well established, helping children know what to expect and when.</p><p>Teachers place a strong focus on supporting children to develop appropriate social skills.</p><p>The centre’s curriculum is built around:</p><ul>
<li>Islamic beliefs and values</li>
<li>Te Whāriki (the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum)</li>
<li>aspects of the Montessori approach</li>
<li>parents’ wishes for their child’s learning.</li>
</ul><p>All of these influences are evident in the day-to-day programme. Teachers recognise that there are some challenges in accommodating these different influences. They have identified that a next step is to look more closely at their centre philosophy and what they want this to look like in practice.</p><p>Teachers place a strong focus on children’s early literacy in English and Arabic. These priorities reflect parents’ wishes and the trust’s goals. The trust has employed a specialist teacher who plans, teaches and monitors children’s progress in Arabic language and teaches aspects of the Islamic faith. Children also have meaningful opportunities for mathematics learning. </p><p>The children speak a range of languages. Their teachers encourage them to use their first languages with each other. Teachers also use children’s first language to support them to learn English. The teachers and parents have identified that learning English is an important goal for many children. The teachers and ERO agree that the next step is for the teachers to explore more deeply how to best support children’s English language development.</p><p>Teachers have quickly established useful systems for planning and assessment. In the best examples:</p><ul>
<li>children’s learning goals are regularly reviewed</li>
<li>goals (including parents’ aspirations) are responded to in learning stories</li>
<li>stories show how teachers supported children’s learning</li>
<li>learning stories show individual children’s progress over time.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers use technology well to involve and inform parents about their children’s learning. Each month they update parents about their children’s learning. They hold informal and formal discussions with parents about their children’s learning and set individual learning goals.</p><p>Group planning is based on Te Whāriki and Islamic beliefs. Plans include experiences and activities to extend children’s knowledge and interests in areas such as science. Teachers reflect on how well the plans were achieved and on their own role in promoting learning. Children under two have their own play area and the teachers plan specific activities for them.</p><p>In a short time the manager and teachers have put in place effective systems and practices for the smooth operation of the centre. This includes a strategic plan that clearly identifies priorities for the centre’s future development. </p><p>The manager and head teacher regularly communicate with each other. The Christchurch-based manager:</p><ul>
<li>provides useful support and advice and monitors the centre’s operations</li>
<li>supports the development of shared leadership in the centre</li>
<li>ensures that teachers benefit from relevant professional learning.</li>
</ul><p>The teachers share and value each other’s individual strengths and work well as a team.</p><p>The manager and regular teachers have a good understanding of the function of self review. Since opening they have regularly carried out small reviews to improve how they support and care for the children. They have chosen relevant topics for future planned reviews.</p><p>Other next steps for the centre’s development include:</p><ul>
<li>making the reporting and monitoring systems more formal</li>
<li>further developing the appraisal system so that it focuses more on growing best teaching practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service's systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>While on site ERO discussed with the manager several practices that could be improved. These included frequency of earthquake and fire drills and strengthening risk-management plans.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of An-Nur Childcare Centre Dunedin will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>1 July 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
