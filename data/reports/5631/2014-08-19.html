</table><p>Renwick Kindergarten is <em>Well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Renwick Kindergarten is one of seven kindergartens administered by Marlborough Kindergarten Association. A general manager oversees the association under the governance of an active, supportive and future-focused board.</p><p>The general manager is responsible for the operation of the kindergartens. The Association’s senior teacher provides advice and guidance for teachers on the curriculum, teaching practices and the running of the kindergarten. The head teacher manages the day to day operation of the kindergarten. All teachers are qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>Renwick Kindergarten is located on the outskirts of Blenheim. It provides care and education for families from the surrounding district, who often move in and out of the area for work. There has recently been a new Head Teacher appointed. Positive changes have occurred and parents are now taking a more active role and are supportive of the kindergarten.</p><p>The association and teachers have responded positively to the recommendations in the March 2011 ERO report. Teaching practices have been improved, teachers’ interactions with children are more effective. Children have greater opportunities for creativity and use natural materials. The ways children’s learning has been reviewed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Marlborough Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten’s philosophy is well presented in an attractive way that makes it easy to understand. The philosophy is strongly evident throughout daily practices and programmes. Children and their parents are warmly welcomed. Teachers foster warm, respectful and caring relationships to support children with their learning and transition through the kindergarten.</p><p>Children are provided with a wide choice of learning experiences and activities. Literacy and numeracy learning is integrated naturally into the programme. Children have many opportunities to contribute their ideas about how resources are set out and used. ERO observed children playing co-operatively for sustained periods of time in creative and imaginative play.</p><p>Teachers know children well and regularly discuss ways that they can support individual children and each other. They use a wide range of effective practices to help promote children’s spontaneous learning, independence and problem solving skills. Children’s learning is regularly assessed and shows their interests, abilities and strengths.</p><p>The physical environment is attractive, well organised and resources are easily accessible. Natural materials are included in meaningful and interesting ways to encourage children’s interest and curiosity. Teachers make effective use of local personnel and resources to extend children’s sense of belonging.</p><p>Teachers are highly supportive of parents. They keep parents well informed about their child’s learning, programmes of learning and kindergarten happenings. Parent contribution to kindergarten activities is highly valued. Whānau of Māori children and those from other cultures are encouraged to share their cultures.</p><p>Teachers have a close relationship with the local school and work together to help children transition to school with confidence.</p><p>Children and families with specific needs are well supported by the Association specialist teacher and other appropriate agencies.</p><p>A recent review of biculturalism across the Association has identified that teachers have an understanding of bicultural practices and are increasing their use of te reo and tikanga Māori. Teachers give Māori culture prominence within the programme and throughout the environment.</p><p>Strong leadership by the new head teacher is encouraging a collaborative approach. Good use is made of teachers’ strengths and they are encouraged to share leadership responsibilities.</p><p>The Marlborough Kindergarten Association provides high levels of direction and support for managers and teachers. Managers ensure that teachers have access to a wide range of professional learning and development opportunities.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO report, the managers have undertaken a thorough review of self review practices. They have identified that this is an ongoing area to continue to develop. Teachers’ understanding of self review is increasing. The useful and recently introduced self review format is helping teachers focus on how they can improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The Association’s long term plan gives clear direction and identifies specific priorities that are improvement focused. Renwick Kindergarten’s annual plan closely links with the Association’s long term plan. However, parts of this plan could be more specific and include detailed short and long term goals.</p><p>The Marlborough Kindergarten Association has a comprehensive policy and procedure framework in place to provide clear expectations for kindergarten operations and the monitoring of health and safety.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager and senior teacher have identified, and ERO agree, that assessment of children’s learning needs to be strengthened. Teachers now need to consistently:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>identify the learning that is happening for individual children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extend the ways they include parent and children’s views about learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify the role of the teacher and what they will do to support children’s future learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers also need to continue to develop the new planning system to more clearly show how children’s emerging interests are being met.</p><p>The Association is currently reviewing the existing appraisal process. Managers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the process needs to be further developed. This should include more robust and formal feedback for teachers about how they can extend their teaching practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Renwick Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Renwick Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>19 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
