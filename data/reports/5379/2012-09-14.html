<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Raumati Beach Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">Parents are made to feel welcome and encouraged to participate in the programme. Teachers are responsive to families&rsquo; wishes and needs for their children&rsquo;s learning and development.</p><p align="left">Teachers know the children well. They interact warmly and respectfully to support them in following their interests. Children relate to each other positively and are encouraged to show care and consideration in play.</p><p align="left">The programme supports development of children&rsquo;s physical, emotional and social well-being and their learning through bicultural perspectives and experiences. The teaching philosophy promotes children&rsquo;s social dispositions and qualities of good character. Children have opportunities for uninterrupted independent and group play. They are able to sustain their interests and persevere in their learning.</p><p align="left">Learning stories appropriately reflect children&rsquo;s &lsquo;voices&rsquo;, interests, strengths and parents&rsquo; views. Individual portfolios are easily accessible. Parents and children enjoy revisiting past experiences and tracking development.</p><p align="left">A well-designed transition programme assists children with settling into the kindergarten and then moving on to school. Relationships between the kindergarten, local schools and families are close and support these processes.</p><p align="left">Next steps for improvement include review and development of self-review processes and staff implementation of early literacy and numeracy experiences.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Raumati Beach Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atRaumati Beach Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left"><span>Raumati Beach Kindergarten is situated on the Kapiti Coast, north of Wellington.</span> Since the May 2008 ERO review the kindergarten has moved to an all-day licence. As a result, the teaching team has been increased to comprise a head teacher and three other teachers. Older children attend for three days each week and younger children on the other two days.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">The teaching philosophy is implemented to promote development of children&rsquo;s social competencies and dispositions. The programme supports their physical, social and emotional well-being. Children&rsquo;s development of desired qualities is celebrated weekly at mat time. Imaginative play, problem solving, creative arts and physical exploration are evident in independent and group play. Children are able to follow their interests and persevere with learning.</p><p align="left">Teachers have followed the Te Manawa guidelines to effectively inform their curriculum planning and assessment. They meet regularly to identify individual and group strengths, learning needs and opportunities for success. These are clearly reflected in learning stories which are also informed by input from parents and children. Inclusion of these perspectives demonstrates the close partnerships kindergarten staff have with families.</p><p align="left">Teachers use information and communication technologies (ICT) effectively to help children extend their interests, carry out research and revisit their learning documented in digital displays. ICT is used particularly well to support the learning of children who have specifically indentified needs.</p><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s progress and development are documented in individual portfolios which parents and children are able to access and revisit to enjoy past experiences or recognition of special successes.</p><p align="left">Teachers reflect on their practice. They are developing processes and tools for self review. A recent review of managing transitions has led to improved strategies for supporting successful entry to school. Visits to local schools, organised with parents and new entrant teachers, are helping to promote confidence and security for children moving to the next stage of learning. Parent feedback affirms the work of the kindergarten in preparing their children for school and how well transition processes are working.</p><p align="left">Teachers&rsquo; inclusion of bicultural perspectives and experiences in the programme is appropriately supported by targeted learning in te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori.</p><p align="left">The head teacher leads her team effectively. Teachers are a professional group who work collaboratively for children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p align="left">Teachers interact positively and respectfully with children to support them to follow their interests. They know the children well and are responsive to their questions, ideas and needs. Teachers model and reinforce inclusive, considerate and cooperative behaviours for children. Children interact positively and respectfully. Parents value the level of teacher care for the well-being of their children.</p><p align="left">The environment is welcoming for children and families. Teachers use M&#257;ori symbols, displays and natural resources to contribute to the relevance of the learning environment and connections with wh&#257;nau. Parents have space to engage with teachers and each other and use resources.</p><p align="left">Reorganised indoor spaces provide improved access for art, large-scale projects and flow between activities. The outdoor environment offers children interest and challenges for exploration and involvement in a wide variety of activities. Structures and equipment provide opportunities for developing coordination, strength, agility and flexibility. Gardens offer spaces for children to have quiet time.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">The next step for kindergarten development is for staff to continue to build understanding and consistency in undertaking self review to promote positive outcomes for children. Aspects of programme provision likely to benefit from review are:</p><ul>
<li>how well teachers incorporate early literacy and numeracy experiences within programme activities. Teachers should work toward consistency of practice through shared understandings about deliberate and responsive planning</li>
<li>how well the more secluded parts of the outdoor environment are maintained so they are inviting for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Association Support</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p align="left">Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p align="left">The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</li>
<li>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</li>
<li>a wide range of professional development opportunities</li>
<li>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</li>
<li>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice as a result of feedback</li>
<li>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association strategic priorities.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Raumati Beach Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p align="left">In order to improve current practice the managers should:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the system for regular checking and removal of hazards</li>

The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">Parents are made to feel welcome and encouraged to participate in the programme. Teachers are responsive to families&rsquo; wishes and needs for their children&rsquo;s learning and development.</p><p align="left">Teachers know the children well. They interact warmly and respectfully to support them in following their interests. Children relate to each other positively and are encouraged to show care and consideration in play.</p><p align="left">The programme supports development of children&rsquo;s physical, emotional and social well-being and their learning through bicultural perspectives and experiences. The teaching philosophy promotes children&rsquo;s social dispositions and qualities of good character. Children have opportunities for uninterrupted independent and group play. They are able to sustain their interests and persevere in their learning.</p><p align="left">Learning stories appropriately reflect children&rsquo;s &lsquo;voices&rsquo;, interests, strengths and parents&rsquo; views. Individual portfolios are easily accessible. Parents and children enjoy revisiting past experiences and tracking development.</p><p align="left">A well-designed transition programme assists children with settling into the kindergarten and then moving on to school. Relationships between the kindergarten, local schools and families are close and support these processes.</p><p align="left">Next steps for improvement include review and development of self-review processes and staff implementation of early literacy and numeracy experiences.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Joyce Gebbie</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Central Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
