</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Speckled Frog Preschool is a privately owned centre. It is licensed to provide all-day early childhood education and care for up to 27 children, including 15 up to the age of two years. Of the 34 enrolled, nine children are Māori.</p><p>The owner manages the service and, together with a head teacher, leads programme and teaching development. Since the January 2014 ERO report some staffing changes have occurred.</p><p>The previous ERO review identified that significant improvement was needed, particularly in relation to developing shared expectations of effective early childhood teaching and learning. Key next steps included: developing teachers' understanding of curriculum and its effective implementation; improving the quality of teaching (particularly for infants and toddlers); responding to children’s culture, language and identity; strengthening the appraisal process and understanding of self review; and reviewing the transition-to-school programme. Leaders were required to further develop their understanding of legislative requirements and develop a responsive process for assessment, planning and evaluation, including promoting parent involvement.</p><p>Following that ERO review, the teaching team received targeted support through a Ministry of Education programme - Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders and the teaching team have worked collaboratively to develop shared expectations of high quality early childhood practice. They have participated in a range of professional development to further their understanding of teaching and learning, children’s culture, language and identity, and self review. Good progress has been made in developing shared expectations of high quality practice.</p><p>The programme is reflective of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Leaders have clearly identified curriculum emphases through their philosophy. This approach promotes a childled learning programme, partnership with parents, respect for Te Tiriti o Waitangi and an appreciation of the living world. A strong commitment to the centre philosophy is evident in practice.</p><p>Routines provide a useful framework for the day and foster independence and social competence. Teachers work alongside children, supporting and extending their interests as they engage in sustained play. Satisfactory progress has been made by teachers in offering children real choices in a child-led programme. Ongoing development in this area should continue, including a focus on providing a wider range of learning experiences that promote literacy and mathematics in a playbased setting.</p><p>A key-teacher approach has been introduced to provide infants and toddlers with a responsive and trusting relationship with one teacher. Children’s individual care moments and infants' rhythms are followed. This results in a calm and peaceful atmosphere. Substantial progress has been made by teachers in providing an infant-and-toddler programme based on best practice.</p><p>Children's profiles show that a range of observation techniques is used to illustrate how children participate in the centre and to highlight their emerging interests. Teachers' analyses of these documents are inconsistent and at times focus on the value of the experience rather than the learning for the child. It is not clear how the information is used to extend the child's learning. Teachers have provided children and parents access to these portfolios through a range of media.</p><p>Group planning has been introduced. This planned approach provides opportunities for children to engage in experiences that provoke their thinking and extend learning. As a result of recent developments in the assessment process, it is timely for the centre to review the programme assessment and evaluation policy to establish clear expectations and reflect current practice. Leaders should clarify the purpose and use of assessment and outline expectations of teachers in following the assessment cycle and involving parents in this process.</p><p>Transition to school has been a recent self-review focus. Leaders and teachers reflected on current research and have sought multiple perspectives through this process. A next step is for leaders to identify indicators of school readiness for children. Developing this shared understanding of how to best support children in their preparedness for school should assist their transitions. Leaders and teachers should develop an understanding of the links between <em>Te Whāriki</em> and <em>The New Zealand Curriculum.</em></p><p>Leaders have been building bicultural practice in the centre. This perspective is evident through the environment and aspects of the curriculum. Teachers integrate the use of te reo Māori throughout the programme. Further consideration should be given to how success for Māori as Māori is promoted through strategic level documents and enacted at centre level.</p><p>Leaders have undertaken professional development related to their roles. This has focused on developing an appraisal process and building an understanding of legislative requirements. Roles and responsibilities of the manager and head teacher are well defined.</p><p>Regular appraisals are undertaken. There is a clear appraisal policy that is consistently implemented. Useful feedback and feed forward is evident. Leaders should continue to improve this process by:</p><ul>
<li>providing more comprehensive notes of the appraisal discussion</li>
<li>reflecting that appraisal is aligned with the role description.</li>
</ul><p>A contract to guide the delivery of an advice and guidance programme for provisionally registered teachers has been put in place. This outlines the responsibilities of the mentor from the centre perspective.</p><p>Self review is developing. Leaders and teachers have participated in professional learning and development to build their understanding of, and confidence in, the process of internal evaluation. Implementation of this process requires ongoing development. Next steps should include:</p><ul>
<li>consistently establishing a robust set of quality indicators to evaluate against</li>
<li>consideration of the range of evidence required to form an evaluative judgement</li>
<li>a focus on evaluating how well practices support children’s learning rather than reviewing what they do.</li>
</ul><p>Implementation of the 2013-2015 strategic plan has been well documented. Leaders should evaluate the impact of these initiatives over time to inform ongoing developments. The annual plan provides a calendar of events in relation to key tasks undertaken each year. A next step is to clearly identify who is responsible, what the focus is and the timeline for implementation.</p><p>Leaders have been proactive in meeting the requirements of the Vulnerable Children’s Act (2014). A number of guiding processes have been implemented into the centre's administrative processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre management and leaders should continue to focus on strengthening practice to improve outcomes for children. Next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing the programme, assessment and evaluation policy to develop clear expectations for teachers</li>
<li>developing indicators of school readiness for children and an understanding of the links between <em>Te Whāriki</em> and <em>The New Zealand Curriculum</em></li>
<li>providing a wider range of learning experiences that promote literacy and mathematics in a playbased setting</li>
<li>identifying how success for Māori as Māori will be promoted through strategic level documents and monitoring the implementation of this approach</li>
<li>continuing to build the evaluative capacity of leaders and teachers.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Speckled Frog Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Speckled Frog Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>15 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
