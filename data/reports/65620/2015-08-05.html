</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Mayfield is owned by and operated under the BestStart Educare Ltd management structure. BestStart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large, national organisation that owns early childhood centres across New Zealand.</p><p>ABC Mayfield is a purpose-built centre providing education and care for children from birth to school age. Forty children may attend the centre at any one time, including up to ten under two years of age. The centre operates across two rooms, each with a separate outdoor play space.</p><p>The centre manager oversees the day-to-day operation of the centre. BestStart provides advice and support through regular visits and contact from an area manager. Most of the staff are qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>There have been historical changes of ownership since the centre opened and a number of new centre managers since the last ERO review in 2012. There is now a permanent centre manager and recently an assistant centre manager was appointed. The centre is continuing to address the recommendations in the ERO report that include professional development provided in self review, child assessment and programme planning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have good opportunities to make decisions about their play. There are many opportunities within the programme for older and younger children to play together and share their knowledge and skills.</p><p>Children experience a variety of activities in the indoor and outdoor areas. The older children have many opportunities for active and quiet play in their newly upgraded outdoor area.</p><p>Children enjoy having caring, positive relationships with their teachers. They recognise and value children’s cultural identities and support all children to broaden their play and ideas.</p><p>Relationships with parents and whānau are well established. Leaders and teachers regularly ask parents to contribute to centre decision making. The centre makes good use of community and specialist resources to support children and their families.</p><p>Leaders make good use of the appraisal process to confirm teachers’ good practice, give relevant feedback and identify areas for the ongoing support.</p><p>Recent professional development, provided by centre leaders and external groups, has had positive impacts on teaching practices. Staff are developing a shared understanding of self review, assessment and planning.</p><p>BestStart has many systems to help centres improve learning outcomes for children. These include:</p><ul>
<li>a review process to identify what is going well and next steps for centre improvement</li>
<li>support to centre managers for the day-to-day operation of their centres from regular visits by BestStart managers</li>
<li>effective systems and processes for ensuring that children have safe and healthy learning environments.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The area manager, centre manager and teachers now need to develop clearer understandings of, and make better use of, BestStart’s systems for monitoring the quality of education at the centre. This includes developing strategic planning that is useful for prioritising and guiding centre improvement, and making use of some BestStart tools such as the Be School Ready indicators.</p><p>The centre has identified, and ERO confirms, the key next steps for development should include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to develop and strengthen self review processes</li>
<li>increasing the ways teachers incorporate bicultural perspectives into programmes and practices</li>
<li>continuing to establish and strengthen child assessment, programme planning and evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Mayfield completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Mayfield will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>5 August 2015</p><h4>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h4><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework<a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"> Ngā Pou Here</a>:</li>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
