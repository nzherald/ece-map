</table><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Paraone is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children with the support of the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Paraone is located in Taumarunui and provides education and care for children from 2 years to school age in a school-day programme. The kindergarten is licensed for 40 children, and at the time of this review had a roll of 46. There are 31 children identified as Māori, who whakapapa to a range of different iwi. The ethnicity of the current teaching staff reflects the bi-cultural nature of the kindergarten and community. The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust (known as Central Kids).</p><p>The kindergarten’s philosophy states that each child is seen as a unique individual who brings their own wisdom and knowledge to the centre, and is encouraged to take ownership of his or her learning.</p><p>The kindergarten has a positive ERO reporting history. Since the 2010 ERO review, the kindergarten has increased its daily roll from 30 to 40 children in response to community needs. The teaching staff has remained the same. However at the time of this review, the head teacher was on extended leave and an acting head teacher had been appointed.</p><p>Teachers have participated in a wide range of professional development and learning to strengthen teaching practices. They are also developing a greater understanding of promoting Māori perspectives and environmental sustainability across the learning programme.</p><p>At the time of this review Central Kids had plans in place to undertake major renovations to the indoor and outdoor areas. Completion of this work has been given a high priority by the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust, and should be finished by the start of Term 1, 2014.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 13 reviews in the Central Kids umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from participating in a programme that responds to their emerging interests. There are many opportunities for them to develop their independence and self-management skills. Children select their resources, lead their learning and play, and make decisions about kai and hygiene routines.</p><p>Teachers support children’s learning and play through positive and caring relationships developed with them and their whānau. They know children and their families well, and encourage parents to stay and participate in their children’s play. Teachers have strong links with the local community and use parent and community expertise to contribute to the programme. Children experience frequent trips into the local and wider community.</p><p>The meaningful integration of Te Ao Māori in the daily programme supports children’s sense of well being and identity. Children have many opportunities to develop their literacy and mathematics skills, both in English and Māori. The outdoor environment is spacious and provides children with opportunities to experience physical challenge and exploration.</p><p>Teachers join children in play and use a range of effective strategies to engage them in meaningful conversations to extend their language and build social skills. They work together to ensure that children’s play is well supported in the indoor and outdoor areas. A special feature of the kindergarten is the inclusive approach adopted by teachers and support workers to successfully engage children with diverse needs. Parents and children benefit from this care and nurture.</p><p>Parents are kept well informed about their children’s participation in the programme through conversations with teachers, children’s portfolios and newsletters. They are encouraged to stay at the kindergarten and read the learning stories with their children. Children are assisted in their transitions within and from the kindergarten.</p><p>Teachers share the roles and responsibilities of kindergarten operations. The head teacher provided direction in beginning to review the vision for the kindergarten with the help of external support. She has worked with the professional leader to encourage and support teachers and parents in realising the vision of supporting each child to gain lifelong skills, knowledge and attributes.</p><p>The kindergarten continues to receive good quality support from Central Kids. The Central Kids professional leader has established a positive and supportive relationship with staff. Comprehensive policy guidelines assist staff to meet regulatory requirements and Central Kids’ standards and expectations.</p><p>As part of this review, ERO evaluated the effectiveness of the kindergarten’s responsibilities for the employment and management of staff. Central Kids have developed and implemented highly effective processes to manage and appoint staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>While the vision for the kindergarten has been established, there remains a need to develop clarity in how this vision is to be enacted. Systems and processes, including self review, staff meetings, assessment and planning need to be clearer to staff and better documented.</p><p>ERO and the Central Kids professional leader agree that there is a need to strengthen the team approach to leadership in order to maximise teacher and whānau expertise in improving these systems and processes. A more inclusive approach to leadership should support the effectiveness of:</p><ul>
<li>annual planning</li>
<li>self review</li>
<li>teacher appraisal and mentoring</li>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Paraone completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Paraone will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>4 July 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
