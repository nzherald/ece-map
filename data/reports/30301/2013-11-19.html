</table><p>Well placed</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Jack and Jill Educare is a privately owned centre located in central Hamilton. The centre provides full day education and care for children from three months to school age in two age-based rooms.It is licensed for 50 children, including 25 under the age of two years. At the time of this ERO review the centre’s roll was 58 of whom 5 identify as Māori.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review leadership and staffing at the centre has been stable. The centre owner provides overall governance and administration responsibility for the centre. The centre manager continues to provide professional leadership of the over two room, she is supported by a separate team leader for the under two area. Eight of the eleven teachers at the centre are qualified early childhood teachers. Centre leaders have responded positively to the areas for development identified in the 2011 ERO report. This has included accessing extensive professional development for teachers to increase their understanding of assessment practices. Leaders and teachers have also reviewed the programme to increase opportunities for children to be involved in sustained, uninterrupted play.</p><p>The centre's philosophy makes a commitment to creating an environment where children are supported to grow as confident learners and communicators, healthy in mind, body and spirit.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre owner promotes positive outcomes for children by maintaining very good teacher-to-child ratios and providing a spacious and purpose-built learning environment. She is supportive of centre leadership, teachers and ongoing improvement. The centre continues to access external expertise further to develop the quality of teaching practice. A useful policy framework guides centre operations. These policies are regularly reviewed in consultation with parents and teachers.</p><p>The centre manager and head teacher are providing good-quality leadership for teachers. They have successfully focused on developing collaborative team cultures in the two age-based rooms. Centre leaders have effectively led significant developments in self-review practices resulting in higher levels of teacher reflection about their practice and the learning programme. They have a strong commitment to professional learning and model effective teaching practice.</p><p>As a result of teacher professional development and self review, children have increased opportunities to make choices and participate in sustained play. Teachers integrate literacy, mathematics and science learning in children’s play and other meaningful contexts. Children’s transitions into the centre and between the rooms are sensitively managed. Since the 2011 ERO review, teachers have placed an increased emphasis on including aspects of te reo and tikanga Māori in the programme and environment. ERO and centre leaders agree that there is a need to continue to build on this progress. Teachers keep parents well informed about their children’s learning and progress through informal discussions and attractively presented portfolios.</p><p>Babies and toddlers benefit from respectful, responsive and nurturing care. Teachers work closely with parents and whānau to ensure home and centre routines for babies are well aligned. Consistent caring supports babies need to form strong and secure attachments.</p><p>A feature of the centre, is the positive and affirming relationships among teachers and children, which contributes to a secure and settled learning environment. Teachers support the development of children’s independence and self-care skills. They foster confidence to select from a range of resources and make decisions about their learning and play.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the key next steps are to strengthen aspects of centre-wide, professional leadership including:</p><ul>
<li>developing a meaningful strategic plan, informed by self review, which sets clear priorities for centre development</li>
<li>increasing the consistency of quality teaching practice by developing shared expectations for effective teaching, and strengthening teacher appraisal processes</li>
<li>continuing to review and increase the centre’s resources and environment to increase opportunities for children to be creative and experience challenge in their learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Jack and Jill Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‘have’ or ‘have not’ taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Jack and Jill Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>19 November 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
