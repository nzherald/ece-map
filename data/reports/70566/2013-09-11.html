</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Childs Play Pre-school Ltd is a privately owned and operated early childhood centre. The centre provides education and care for infants, toddlers and preschool children in three separate spaces. Staff have developed effective systems for children to provide supportive transition into the centre and between areas.</p><p>Children and families come from a wide geographical area to attend the centre. In the last few years, an increasing number of cultures are represented at the centre.</p><p>The centre owners provide support for people in their community to train as early childhood teachers. Most teachers at the centre are qualified.</p><p>The 2011 ERO report, identified the need for improvements in assessment, bicultural perspectives and teacher appraisal. In 2012, external advisors helped staff to develop assessment practices and bicultural perspectives. These are now in the early stages of implementation. The centre owners and manager are committed to the ongoing strengthening of these developments to provide positive outcomes for children and families.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre owners have a strong focus on fostering positive and supportive relationships with children, families and the community. Children and families are warmly welcomed into the centre. Parents and teachers share information to ensure children’s sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>Teachers are caring and responsive to children’s individual needs and interests. They provide opportunities for children to develop their social skills to help them build and maintain friendships with others.</p><p>Children have easy access to a wide range of quality resources and interesting specialised equipment that is created on-site. They are involved in a range of physical activities and challenges for long periods of uninterrupted time. Literacy and numeracy learning is a prominent aspect of the programme for older children. Visitors from the community enhance learning opportunities for children.</p><p>During the review, ERO observed a calm and unhurried learning environment for infants and toddlers. Teachers provide a responsive programme for children up to two years old through well paced routines. Children benefit from nurturing, sensitive and respectful interactions with their teachers that supports their sense of security and wellbeing.</p><p>The owners, managers, teachers and children value New Zealand’s bicultural heritage. A recent focus on improving the integration of Māori perspectives has had a positive impact on teaching and learning. Some teachers are confident to provide good modelling of te reo Māori and to support children to begin to use the language. The learning environment reflects this greater focus and appreciation of Māori perspectives.</p><p>Teachers are encouraged to reflect on their practice and to find innovative ways to identify children’s individual strengths and abilities and to improve learning outcomes for the children.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review, the centre owners have made some changes to the management structure of the centre. They have established a new centre manager and head teacher. These roles will help strengthen the centre vision and build professional practice. Effective use of external professional development has helped to establish useful self-review processes that support the focus and ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre owners and manager have identified, and ERO agrees, that the newly established assessment practices need to be further strengthened and extended to improve programme planning and evaluation processes and practices. This includes improving the:</p><ul>
<li>consistency of the quality of assessment</li>
<li>visibility of children’s culture, language and identity in assessment</li>
<li>parent contributions to their child’s learning</li>
<li>links between assessment and programme planning</li>
<li>teaching strategies to add value to and extend on children’s learning</li>
<li>evaluation of the impact of teaching practices on learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Some management systems need to be strengthened to support the ongoing improvement and sustainability of the service. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>strategic planning that links to the centre's philosophy and aligns with self review</li>
<li>further developing self review by establishing a schedule of planned review</li>
<li>ensuring multiple perspectives that include parent and children contributions are used in self review</li>
<li>embedding new staff appraisal and attestation processes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Childs Play Pre-School Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Childs Play Pre-School Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>11 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
