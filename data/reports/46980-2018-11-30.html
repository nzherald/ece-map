</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The In Home Childcare Company is a licensed all-day, home-based education and care service operating in Lower Hutt. The service is privately owned and licensed for 60 children, including 20 aged up to two. Of the 39 children enrolled, 11 identify as Māori. Educators work in their own homes with up to four children at one time.</p><p>The owner and visiting teacher are qualified early childhood teachers. They provide support and guidance to educators to promote responsive education and care to children. Service-wide playgroups operate twice a week to facilitate children's experiences within the local community and natural environment. This includes the E Tipu group that provides a transition-to-school programme for older children within a home-base context.</p><p>The In Home Childcare Company is committed to providing high quality education and care for each child and their whānau. The philosophy promotes the exploration of the natural world and access to the wider community. It is underpinned by kaupapa Māori principles of whanaungatanga, ako and maintaining a connection to Papatūānuku.</p><p>This is the first ERO evaluation of The In Home Childcare Company.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A strong vision sets the direction for the service. Children have access to a wide range of meaningful learning experiences that fosters their exploration and discovery. The philosophy is evident in practice and is well aligned to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. A shared understanding of the service's priorities for children's learning continues to be developed to promote consistent practice across the service.</p><p>Leaders and educators are building their knowledge and understanding of te ao Māori concepts. Regular excursions within the community provide plentiful opportunities for children to connect with Papatūānuku and visit significant landmarks. Leaders are actively working towards growing their use of te reo Māori across the curriculum. Strategies are in place to support Māori learners and whānau to achieve educational success.</p><p>Regular playgroup experiences are well considered and responsive to children's emerging interests, encouraging free play and social interactions. All children's cultures, languages and identities are celebrated and affirmed. The integration of te reo Māori and New Zealand Sign Language within the group story documentation is emerging. A deliberate approach to supporting older children to transition to school is successfully promoted through the "E tipu" programme.</p><p>Effective induction processes promotes children's sense of belonging and wellbeing as they transition into the service. Strong relationships between educators, children and their parents are evident. Parents are well informed of the service's operation and encouraged to participate and provide feedback.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well supported to fully participate in the learning programme. Educators are responsive, nurturing and respectful of children's preferences and parents' aspirations.</p><p>Leaders advocate for children with diverse learning needs. Visiting teachers work alongside educators and whānau to access support from external agencies when needed. A next step is to strengthen planning to further enhance learning opportunities.</p><p>Children's participation and engagement in learning through play is regularly documented. Leaders and educators effectively notice individual children's interests and provide purposeful experiences in response. The use of an online portal supports whānau to contribute to their children's learning. Ongoing development is required in the documentation of assessment and visiting teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>analyse information that is regularly gathered about children to further inform curriculum planning and decision making</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify the learning that is happening and how this has progressed over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure individualised planning supports the child to meet the identified learning outcome.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Policies and procedures set out clear expectations to meet the <em>Licensing Criteria for Home-based Education and Care Services, 2008</em>. Leadership regularly monitors the health and safety of children through regular home visits. The appraisal system for the visiting teachers is yet to be consolidated and requires urgent attention to meet recent changes in legislation. Educators are well supported to build their capability.</p><p>Regular self review results in positive change to strengthen systems, policies and procedures and aspects of the curriculum. A next step is monitor, evaluate and report on the extent to which outcomes for children and their families' are improved through systems processes and initiatives. This should include consideration of impact of the curriculum on specific priority groups.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Priorities for this service to strengthen includes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation for children’s individual learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the appraisal process and procedure for endorsing and renewal of teachers practising certificates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating the impact of changes made and how these support positive outcomes for children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The In Home Childcare Company completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist.</em> In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance, management and administration. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the service provider must implement a formal annual appraisal of the service manager that meets Education Council requirements.<br> <em>[Licensing Criteria for Home-based Education and Care Services 2008, GMA6]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Areas for improved compliance practice</h3><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should strengthen the hazard management procedure, this includes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clearly establishing, and articulating the ratio of adults to children prior to undertaking special excursions when visiting areas where they may have access to water.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the onsite stage of the review, the service provider has provided additional evidence of the educator hazard identification and risk assessment - group outings policy that articulates the expected ratio of adults to children and steps in place to minimise any possible risk of accident or injury around water.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The In Home Childcare Company will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>30 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
