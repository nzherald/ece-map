</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiwi Corner Early Learning Centre is a well established service located in Henderson, Auckland. The centre caters for infants, toddlers and children up to school age in two adjacent buildings, each of which has spacious indoor and outdoor play spaces.</p><p>The centre’s inclusive philosophy allows children to play and learn in a nurturing environment. Programmes show a commitment to the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and reflect the aspirations of parents and whānau. Strong connections with the community build children’s social awareness and sense of belonging.</p><p>The centre has a history of positive ERO reports. Good practices identified in the 2010 ERO report continue to be evident. The experienced centre owner leads a team of well qualified and experienced staff. Generous teacher to child ratios support children’s development as capable competent learners.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and confident in the environment. They make choices in their play from a range of thoughtfully selected and well used resources. Children engage in sustained individual and social play. They have time to make discoveries and investigate ideas that are important to them.</p><p>Infants and toddlers receive good quality care. They benefit from teachers who know them and their families well. Teachers are responsive and sensitive to children’s preferences and interests. Transitions into the centre and between rooms are carefully managed so that the change for children is gradual and responds to their growing confidence.</p><p>Children’s wellbeing and sense of belonging are nurtured through respectful relationships between children and adults. Teachers’ appreciation for te reo and tikanga Māori is evident in the ways that these are integrated throughout the programme and environment. Māori children’s mana is recognised and valued.</p><p>Programmes are responsive to children’s interests and strengths. Teachers consult with children and their families to plan the programme. Planning is ongoing to ensure that links are made across the centre in a coordinated manner. Literacy and numeracy are integrated through the programme. Bicultural and multicultural practices support Māori and Pacific children’s learning.</p><p>Children’s assessment portfolios celebrate their learning and development. They show teachers’ thinking about each child’s learning and provide good information for parents. Attractive photos capture children’s engagement in the programme. Parents and whānau are kept well informed about their children’s progress and learning.</p><p>Whānau are welcome in the centre and positive relationships are evident between teachers and families. Centre leaders are exploring ways to enhance communications with parents, whānau and aiga to further promote parent partnerships in learning.</p><p>The centre is well led. The centre manager is focused on extending the knowledge and practice of the teaching team. She works together with the head teacher to model good quality teaching practices and works effectively to promote ongoing teacher development. Self review is systematic, well documented and is clearly resulting in ongoing improvements for children. Centre leaders have a strong focus on self review to guide significant development for the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that to enhance centre operations and practice they could:</p><ul>
<li>continue to extend children’s learning through specific programme planning, assessment and evaluation</li>
<li>continue to foster partnerships with parents and the local community to benefit children’s learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiwi Corner Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kiwi Corner Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>27 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
