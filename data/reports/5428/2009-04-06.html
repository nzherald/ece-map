<a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Bromley is one of 62 kindergartens administered by Kidsfirst Kindergartens – Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association. The kindergarten operates within the constitution of the association. The chief executive of the association is the licensee for all kindergartens. Each kindergarten has an education services manager who provides support and guidance through visits, telephone contact and planning for professional development.</p><p align="left">The focus of this review was on the quality of education. ERO reviewed the programme, the learning environment and the quality of the interactions, to see how these contribute to children’s learning and development. ERO is evaluating Mäori children in all early childhood centres during term four 2008. ERO also checked some aspects of health and safety.</p><p align="left">The teaching team is a good gender balance of both male and female staff. One of the male staff members is currently considering study in 2009 to become qualified as an early childhood educator.</p><p align="left">Positive features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>confident children who are supported by responsive teachers;</li>
<li>strong relationships between teachers and children, their families and the local community;</li>
<li>a cohesive team approach where children are well supported by teachers who focus on increasing children’s learning;</li>
<li>children developing literacy skills including writing and promotion of oral language skills;</li>
<li>the kindergarten environment and the focus on sustainability and environmental education; and</li>
<li>the links and transition process to school that teachers have developed.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Since the 2005 ERO review, teachers have made good progress in developing assessment practices to monitor children’s individual learning. Teachers have developed a systematic and comprehensive process of self-review. They review play areas and seek further evidence by including surveys from parents and the school community. Teachers have a clear process of self review.</p><p align="left">The next steps for further development include:</p><ul>
<li>improving assessment practices to include formal documentation of parents’ aspirations and goals for their child; and</li>
<li>increasing the spontaneous use of te reo Mäori in the kindergarten programme.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><div>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
</div><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Bromley was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left"><span>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at</span> <span>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Bromley.</span></p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO’s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The kindergarten association philosophy states that children are supported to become confident and competent learners. Teachers provide a welcoming culture where children and their whänau feel a sense of belonging and their well being is nurtured. The philosophy reflects the statement that children are provided with learning experiences through a range of play activities. Children are offered opportunities to interact with others in positive and appropriate ways. Teachers state they provide children with clear boundaries of acceptable behaviour. Learning styles, dispositions, individual strengths and interests are planned for within group and solitary activities.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><div>
<p align="left">Respectful responsive relationships.<span>Teachers have consistently high quality relationships with children, their parents, the community and each other. Adults treat children with respect, using effective teaching strategies. For example, they conduct eye level conversations, and pause to give children time to answer. Teachers have sustained conversations with children and respond positively to their verbal and non-verbal communication. Adults have clear expectations, and model appropriate behaviours and routines for children. Children are encouraged, comforted and reassured by their teachers. Parents are warmly welcomed to the centre. Teachers offer advice, encouragement and affirmation of strategies parents can use to support their children.</span></p>
</div><div>
<p align="left">Teaching team. Teachers work in a positive, calm manner to establish a sense of well being for children. The teaching team is ably led by a supervisor who shares leadership opportunities. Teachers communicate clearly with each other and are constantly sharing information about children’s individual goals, needs and interests. ERO observed effective teamwork where adults co-operate well and are flexible in their approach to their roles. They work together to provide good supervision and consistent monitoring of children’s learning.</p>
</div><p>Confident children. Children are confident in their kindergarten environment. They are cooperative, settle quickly into play and invite others to join in their activities. Teachers constantly scan the environment and identify children who might be isolated. They invite them into play. Children enjoy being with adults, and introduce themselves to visitors in a friendly and welcoming way. Whenever adults sit, children are drawn to them and chat informally about their play. The two male and two female teachers take opportunities to spend extended periods of time with children. Children are encouraged by teachers to persevere in play and negotiate ways to successfully problem solve. ERO observed new entrant school children asking advice from the kindergarten teachers at the fence line bordering the school and kindergarten.</p><p>Focus on learning. Teachers focus on increasing children’s knowledge and learning. They work well together to enhance outcomes for children by providing language-based activities that increase oral language skills. They have close links with the local primary school to ensure that the programme they provide ties in with the work done in the new entrant class. There is good provision for literacy and teachers are focused on raising the levels of literacy in the kindergarten. ERO observed children enjoying reading opportunities inside and outdoors. Children take pleasure in story and drama activities that allow them to adopt leadership roles. Teachers provide a good variety of books and written prompts. Home reading is encouraged with the introduction of reading folders. Families and whänau are encouraged to share books at home. Parents are provided with literature to promote literacy awareness and are positive about the initiative.</p><p>Assessing children’s learning. Teachers write learning stories that are purposeful and provide a meaningful record of children’s learning. They share their understandings of individual children based on up to date thinking. They use effective strategies to support assessment so that each child is regularly assessed. Teachers record a detailed analysis of what learning took place in each story. The stories show the depth of children’s learning and build upon the last story. Teachers use photographs to engage children and their families.</p><p>Environmental and sustainability focus. Teachers have provided a strong educational focus on the environment and sustainability. They have involved children in recycling, creating worm farms and substantial vegetable gardens projects. This includes a connection with the local school’s edible garden. Children show an interest in the projects and ERO observed them involved in caring for their garden for an uninterrupted period of time. The kindergarten has also been involved in the healthy heart award. Children and their parents are encouraged to bring healthy snacks to kindergarten. Healthy eating is reflected in the food that parents provide for kai time. Teachers model good practice and have fund raised to enable each child to be provided with a container for their food, reducing the use of wrappings. The kindergarten also has a water monitor that reduces the unnecessary use of water.</p><p>Kindergarten environment. Children are provided with an environment that is spacious, attractive and inviting. There has been a focus on upgrading the outdoor environment. It has been well planned and organised, reflecting the local community. Children enjoy spaces that allow them to play, run and jump. They make good use of all areas and are challenged by the wide range of resources and activities. Children have easy access to the many indoor and outdoor resources. Many of these link to the natural world. Children make very good use of the environment and are well supported in their play.</p><p>Self review. Teachers set goals for improvement in self review and evaluate how well these goals have been achieved. They have reviewed a number of priorities in some depth, for example environmental education, literacy and numeracy. They have tried a number of ways to engage and communicate with parents in a formal process, with some success. Teachers use self review as a reflective tool for ongoing investigation. They have identified that they want to extend the process to include mini research in the future. Teachers reflect on the purpose of self-review and consider what the outcomes for children are likely to be.</p><h4>Areas for improvement</h4><p>Strengthening te reo Mäori. Teachers are enhancing the environment to better reflect Mäori culture. They are in stage three of their plan to develop the physical entranceway to make this more inclusive to Mäori and Pacific cultures. They have identified that their next step is to increase their confidence and use of te reo Mäori so that it is integrated naturally into the kindergarten programme. ERO agrees that enhancing children’s understanding of te reo Mäori will develop their awareness of New Zealand’s bicultural heritage. [Recommendation 6.1]</p><p>Strengthening assessment practices. Teachers are aware that they need to develop assessment practices further. Teachers have yet to document informal conversations so that parent’s/whänau aspirations, goals and thoughts about their children’s learning are more visible in profiles. Some development needs to take place in reflecting children’s cultural backgrounds in assessment stories. In addition, it was not always easy to see how children are contributing to their own assessment. [Recommendation 6.2]</p><div>

This information will be used as the basis for long-term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Māori Children</h3><p align="left">As part of this review, ERO evaluated the extent to which this service carries out a process to identify and respond to the aspirations and expectations of the parents and whānau of Māori children and focuses on the potential of Māori children to develop as competent and capable learners.</p><p align="left"><span>Thirty two per cent of children at Bromley kindergarten identify as Mäori. Teachers seek to consult with families and a recent review of communication with families has been undertaken. However, teachers have yet to develop strategies to ensure that they are effectively recording Mäori whänau aspirations and goals for their children. The vision and centre philosophy has yet to effectively acknowledge New Zealand’s bicultural heritage so that Mäori children, whänau and bicultural practice is naturally integrated into the centre. Teachers are working on “</span><span>whanaungatanga</span><span>” (a sense of family connection) approach in their interactions and conversations with Mäori whänau.</span> <span>[Recommendation 6.1]</span></p><div>
<a id="4-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2>
</div><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left"><span>Before the review, the licensee and staff of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Bromley completed an ERO</span> <span>Centre </span><span>Management Assurance Statement</span> <span>and </span><span>Self-Audit Checklist</span><span>. In these documents they have attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legislative obligations related to:</span></p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO identified one area for further discussion. The association sun safety policy sets out guidelines for teachers to follow, including effective role modelling. During the ERO review, children were not always wearing hats because the parents had not provided them. Teachers said that in the past, centre hats have introduced head lice. In addition, sunscreen is available but parents must apply it to their own child, thus giving responsibility back to the parent. ERO asks the teachers to discuss the their own practices with Kidsfirst management to ensure they are meeting the association guidelines for sun safety.</p><div>
<a id="5-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Recommendations</h2>
</div><p align="left">ERO and the teachers agreed that to improve outcomes for children they would:</p><div>
<p align="left"><span>strengthen</span> <span>policies, procedures, practices and use of te reo Mäori to enhance communication with the kindergarten's Maori parents to include their aspirations, beliefs and values for their children as a focus for the kindergarten; and</span></p>
<p align="left">improve the kindergarten assessment practices.</p>
<a id="6-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6. Future Action</h2>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidsfirst-kindergartens-bromley" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Bromley</h2><p align="left"><span>These are the findings of the Education Review Office’s latest report on</span> Kidsfirst Kindergartens Bromley.</p><p align="left">Kidsfirst Kindergartens Bromley is one of 62 kindergartens administered by Kidsfirst Kindergartens – Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association. The kindergarten operates within the constitution of the association. The chief executive of the association is the licensee for all kindergartens. Each kindergarten has an education services manager who provides support and guidance through visits, telephone contact and planning for professional development.</p><p align="left">The focus of this review was on the quality of education. ERO reviewed the programme, the learning environment and the quality of the interactions, to see how these contribute to children’s learning and development. ERO is evaluating Mäori children in all early childhood centres during term four 2008. ERO also checked some aspects of health and safety.</p><p align="left">The teaching team is a good gender balance of both male and female staff. One of the male staff members is currently considering study in 2009 to become qualified as an early childhood educator.</p><p align="left">Positive features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>confident children who are supported by responsive teachers;</li>
<li>strong relationships between teachers and children, their families and the local community;</li>
<li>a cohesive team approach where children are well supported by teachers who focus on increasing children’s learning;</li>
<li>children developing literacy skills including writing and promotion of oral language skills;</li>
<li>the kindergarten environment and the focus on sustainability and environmental education; and</li>
<li>the links and transition process to school that teachers have developed.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Since the 2005 ERO review, teachers have made good progress in developing assessment practices to monitor children’s individual learning. Teachers have developed a systematic and comprehensive process of self-review. They review play areas and seek further evidence by including surveys from parents and the school community. Teachers have a clear process of self review.</p><p align="left">The next steps for further development include:</p><ul>
<li>improving assessment practices to include formal documentation of parents’ aspirations and goals for their child; and</li>
<li>increasing the spontaneous use of te reo Mäori in the kindergarten programme.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interests of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or licensee if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Isabell Sinclair Irwin</p><p align="left"><span>Area Manager</span></p><p align="left">for Chief Review Officer</p>
