</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Active Discoverers Educare is a new all day education and care service nestled under the Hikemata Hills in Ngāruawāhia. It operates two age group for infants and children over two years of age. There are opportunities for the age groups to come together during the day and they share the outside play area. It is privately owned and led by a centre manager and two team leaders.</p><p>The owner and centre staff have a commitment providing equitable opportunities for all children to participate and attend the centre. This is achieved through providing a van for pick up and drop off to the centre.</p><p>Since the service opened there have been considerable developments in all centre operations and to the physical environment. This is the centre's ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly greeted into a positive environment where they enjoy respectful and trusting relationships with centre staff. Teachers place importance on getting to know children and their families well. Māori values of manakitanga and whanaungatanga underpin the centre culture and this strongly supports children and whānau sense of belonging. Positive relationships help children to settle quickly and contributes to a calm atmosphere that nurtures and supports their well being.</p><p>Children confidently explore the centre's interesting and challenging resources and equipment through play. The local environment is also used to encourage learning through trips that promote hands on discovery. Babies, toddlers and young children are able to spend time together in the shared outside play area. This enables siblings to spend time with one another and enjoy tuakana-teina relationships where children accept leadership responsibilities and can support and learn from one another.</p><p>Regular excursions in the Hakarimata Hills located behind the centre, as well as visits to the local Marae provide children with additional, authentic and meaningful learning Te Ao Māori experiences. Teachers and children network with other early childhood services in Ngāruawāhia through their participation in a community initiative designed to promote physical activity.</p><p>Children learn in a rich range of curriculum areas where they have fun and experience success. The bicultural intent of <em>Te Whāriki</em> (the early childhood curriculum) is being enacted by the service. Te reo and tikanga Māori concepts are naturally integrated throughout the daily programme. Literacy and mathematical concepts are also naturally included into children's interests and play.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from teachers who are highly responsive to their care needs. The daily programme and children's individual routines are unrushed, creating a calm, stress-free atmosphere for play and learning.</p><p>Cultural diversity is embraced by staff. Māori children are valued as tangata whenua, and all cultures of children at the centre are respected and affirmed by teachers who seek to understand, embrace and celebrate cultural difference.</p><p>Teachers are actively involved in children's play and learning. They are skilled at noticing, recognising and responding to children's interests and well-being. Teachers view children as capable and encourage them to be involved in decisions that affect them and empower them to make informed choices. Intentional teaching strategies also build on children's play and support them to problem solve and think critically about their learning.</p><p>Children's social skills are fostered through their interactions and friendships with others. Teachers effectively support children's social development through modelling language and positive ways of communicating.</p><p>Teachers view children holistically and understand the importance of them learning in the context of family and community. Parents and whānau involvement in the centre life and events is welcomed and encouraged by staff. Some families have shared aspects of their culture and language to further support the education of all children. Teachers have established open communication with whānau who appreciate the opportunity to attend social events. Child portfolios share and celebrate children's success in learning and development over time and parents are invited to contribute to these useful records.</p><p>The service owner, centre manager and teachers work as a collaborative team. They have processes in place to reflect on their practice and continually review ways to improve all aspects of centre operations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO affirms the centres' identified next steps for development in their strategic and self-review information which documents the intent to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen assessment and planning</li>
<li>build on te reo and tikanga Māori practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Active Discoverers Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Active Discoverers Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>5 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
