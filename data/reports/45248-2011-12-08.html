<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>This is the first ERO review of Annabel&rsquo;s Educare Avonhead, following its establishment in 2009. This centre is situated in a renovated homestead in Christchurch. The established, spacious natural outdoor areas are a feature of the learning environment.</p><p>The centre provides care and education for up to 75 children from babies to school age. The indoor space has been divided into four separate areas to better cater for the needs of different ages of children and keep group sizes smaller, particularly in the area for babies and toddlers.</p><p>Significant features of the centre for children include:</p><ul>
<li>positive and caring relationships with their teachers</li>
<li>a wide range of resources and learning activities that support their interests</li>
<li>high quality interactions between teachers and children in the nursery programme</li>
<li>strategies that support bicultural practices in the programme.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers regularly share useful information with each other about children&rsquo;s interests and well-being. They are developing a programme that is more responsive to individual children&rsquo;s needs and interests.</p><p>This review was undertaken after the Canterbury earthquakes. Christchurch city and suburbs were particularly affected by both the September 2010 and February 2011 earthquakes. While the centre buildings have not been significantly affected, the earthquake has impacted on centre families, staff and the pace of some centre-wide developments. Some significant curriculum developments were delayed until mid 2011, but are now well underway.</p><p>Centre managers have a clear vision for making ongoing improvements to teaching and learning. Managers are using a range of systems to identify and respond effectively to areas for development. They are making good use of professional development and other ways to give feedback to teachers that supports the changes being made.</p><p>Centre managers have identified that the next steps to improve learning outcomes for children are:</p><ul>
<li>for teachers to further develop aspects of assessment and programme planning</li>
<li>to strengthen how teachers use the centre&rsquo;s guidelines to review their teaching practices</li>
<li>for all teachers to use more practices that extend children&rsquo;s thinking and learning.</li>
</ul><p>There are good systems and practices in place to ensure that children experience a safe environment.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Annabel's Educare Avonhead was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atAnnabel's Educare Avonhead.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The centre philosophy is focused on the values of Manaakitanga (respecting, valuing and supporting each child as an individual), Whanaungatanga (parents being supported in their role and feeling confident, welcomed and able to contribute to the centre programme) and Kotahitanga (working together as one and acknowledging the Treaty of Waitangi and the cultures of the children and their families). Teachers aim to provide a safe, nurturing, creative and challenging environment.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><h4>Interactions</h4><p>Teachers know children well, and respond to them with warmth and affection. They share useful information about the needs of the children. Teachers regularly involve themselves in children&rsquo;s play. They encourage children to talk about their play and interests. Children are confident in going to their teachers for comfort and reassurance.</p><p>Teachers play with infants and toddlers in ways that respect and support children&rsquo;s choices and capabilities within the programme. Teachers make effective use of a range of teaching approaches that support the learning of babies and toddlers.</p><p>These include:</p><ul>
<li>regular and sustained involvement with individual children that follows the child&rsquo;s interests</li>
<li>recognising children&rsquo;s non-verbal gestures and responding appropriately to these</li>
<li>consistently talking with children about their actions and explaining what is about to happen in care routines</li>
<li>ensuring routines are unhurried, calm and used as opportunities to extend child&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>fostering children&rsquo;s language development, including the use of te reo M&#257;ori.</li>
</ul><h3>Learning programme</h3><p>Managers and teachers are changing the programme to be more closely linked to children&rsquo;s interests. They are effectively using well-tailored whole centre professional development to assist them in beginning this process. Managers and teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that these developments are resulting in a programme that is more responsive to individual children&rsquo;s interests and needs. It is also increasing parent and wh&#257;nau involvement in programme planning and children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Learning environment</h3><p>Children benefit from a wide range of resources and activities that support their interests. The centre has spacious indoor and outdoor areas that provide children with good opportunities for quiet as well as active play. Children are able to freely explore and make choices between playing outdoors and indoors.</p><p>During the review, ERO observed children spending sustained periods of time in physical and dramatic play. They also had regular opportunities to take part in music, numeracy, carpentry, literacy, art, craft, and sensory activities.</p><h3>Management</h3><p>The managers have a clear vision for making ongoing improvements to teaching and learning. They have developed a range of effective systems to identify and respond to areas for development. These include:</p><ul>
<li>clear expectations for teaching practices and programmes</li>
<li>a robust appraisal process for improving teacher practices.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, managers and teachers are working together to build their shared understandings about teaching and learning.</p><p>Managers and teachers have successfully established some strategies for supporting bicultural practices. These include:</p><ul>
<li>closely linking the centre philosophy to M&#257;ori culture and values</li>
<li>the use of Ka Hikitia (The Ministry of Education&rsquo;s M&#257;ori Education Strategy) to guide and affirm centre practices</li>
<li>specific policies and guidelines for implementing tikanga M&#257;ori.</li>
</ul><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><h4>Assessment and programme planning</h4><p>Centre managers have identified, and ERO agrees, that assessment and programme planning practices needed to be strengthened to make children&rsquo;s learning more visible.</p><p>The centre managers have undertaken an in depth review and are currently implementing the following strategies:</p><ul>
<li>regularly recognising the learning of individual children</li>
<li>identifying clearer next steps that teachers will take to extend on individual children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>showing progress of children&rsquo;s learning over time.</li>
</ul><p>For planning this includes:</p><ul>
<li>planning for children&rsquo;s learning rather than learning activities</li>
<li>identifying learning outcomes for children in programme planning</li>
<li>evaluating children&rsquo;s learning and reflecting how effectively teaching strategies improve learning outcomes.</li>
</ul><h3>Embedding best practices</h3><p>Centre managers have identified that they need to extend some good practices across the centre. ERO observed variation in how well these teachers use conversations to extend children&rsquo;s thinking and problem solving. For example, preschool teachers should now extend the ways they interact with children. Managers are fostering stronger centre-wide leadership and shared understandings among staff. Managers have also identified the need to strengthen how well teachers use the centre&rsquo;s review guidelines, and te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori across the programme.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of Children with Moderate to Severe Special Needs</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><p>In addition to the areas already identified as strengths in this report, children with moderate to severe special needs at this service are also supported through:</p><ul>
<li>managers and teachers working with wh&#257;nau to focus on the individual needs of children and their families, and develop shared plans to respond to these</li>
<li>clear policies and procedures that support inclusion and are regularly reviewed to ensure effectiveness</li>
<li>managers and teachers regularly communicate with external agencies to support children&rsquo;s learning and development.</li>
</ul><p>The next step is for teachers to use the centre&rsquo;s review guidelines to continue to strengthen programme planning and assessment to further improve outcomes for children and their families.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Annabel's Educare Avonhead completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>

</table><p>8 December 2011</p><p>To the Parents and Community of Annabel's Educare Avonhead</p><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Annabel's Educare Avonhead.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of Annabel&rsquo;s Educare Avonhead, following its establishment in 2009. This centre is situated in a renovated homestead in Christchurch. The established, spacious natural outdoor areas are a feature of the learning environment.</p><p>The centre provides care and education for up to 75 children from babies to school age. The indoor space has been divided into four separate areas to better cater for the needs of different ages of children and keep group sizes smaller, particularly in the area for babies and toddlers.</p><p>Significant features of the centre for children include:</p><ul>
<li>positive and caring relationships with their teachers</li>
<li>a wide range of resources and learning activities that support their interests</li>
<li>high quality interactions between teachers and children in the nursery programme</li>
<li>strategies that support bicultural practices in the programme.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers regularly share useful information with each other about children&rsquo;s interests and well-being. They are developing a programme that is more responsive to individual children&rsquo;s needs and interests.</p><p>This review was undertaken after the Canterbury earthquakes. Christchurch city and suburbs were particularly affected by both the September 2010 and February 2011 earthquakes. While the centre buildings have not been significantly affected, the earthquake has impacted on centre families, staff and the pace of some centre-wide developments. Some significant curriculum developments were delayed until mid 2011, but are now well underway.</p><p>Centre managers have a clear vision for making ongoing improvements to teaching and learning. Managers are using a range of systems to identify and respond effectively to areas for development. They are making good use of professional development and other ways to give feedback to teachers that supports the changes being made.</p><p>Centre managers have identified that the next steps to improve learning outcomes for children are:</p><ul>
<li>for teachers to further develop aspects of assessment and programme planning</li>
<li>to strengthen how teachers use the centre&rsquo;s guidelines to review their teaching practices</li>
<li>for all teachers to use more practices that extend children&rsquo;s thinking and learning.</li>
</ul><p>There are good systems and practices in place to ensure that children experience a safe environment.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p>National Evaluation Topics &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
