</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waimate Mobile is the only mobile kindergarten remaining in New Zealand. Each week day, two teachers drive a van loaded with resources and equipment to a different rural location in the Waimate district. The teachers serve 5 very diverse communities over the week. The mobile kindergarten is the only preschool service some of the children attend.</p><p>With the help of the parents from the area, the teachers set up a play and learning programme for the local preschool children. Children aged from newborn to five years attend the three to four hour sessions with their parents. The sessions provide an important opportunity for families to get together, form friendships and share information that supports their children’s early education. The newly-appointed head teacher is fully trained and she and a teacher-aide plan a specific programme every week to meet the needs of the children attending each site.</p><p>ERO visited one of the 5 sites during the review.</p><p>At the time of the review the board and the general manager were in the process of working with the Ministry of Education to enable the Mobile Kindergarten venues to meet the 2008 ECE regulations and licensing criteria. The association, with the support of the various communities, is committed to retaining what is considered an essential and valuable service benefiting the local children, their families and communities.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO review there have been several changes to the structure of some of the kindergarten sessions and to their location. Some adjustments were made to meet the changing needs of the community and to provide more appropriate session sites. Other improvements have followed from a comprehensive action plan the teaching team developed to address the recommendations from the last ERO review</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 2 kindergarten reviews in the Waimate Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Documents and discussions with managers and teachers, together with the observations from the one site ERO visited, show that the service provides a range of experiences for children. A feature of the service visited is the way the beliefs of the teachers for learning could be seen in what they do with and for children. Whanaungatanga (relationships and community connections) and Manaakitanga (caring for one another) are particularly strong. It was evident that parents and children greatly value the service. They settle quickly with high levels of engagement in the session.</p><p>Other positive features include:</p><ul>
<li>children benefiting from supportive relationships and the affirming, respectful interactions that occur between and with the adults present</li>
<li>children supporting one another and interacting positively and caringly</li>
<li>children having access to a wide range of experiences and good quality resources and equipment that encourage and support all forms of learning</li>
<li>parents and teachers working together to set up the session, ensure the session goes well and supporting children’s wellbeing and safety</li>
<li>the way the teacher’s planning reflects the changing needs of the community and the individual children attending.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have effective learning conversations with children. They intentionally plan to help children learn social skills. They use their knowledge of children and their families as a starting point and gather parents’ wishes for their children’s learning to strengthen this process.</p><p>Children, parents and teachers take collective responsibility for younger children. Children consistently play well with and alongside each other in small group activities.</p><p>The teaching team is very aware of the diverse cultural backgrounds of the families attending and is highly sensitive and responsive to these. Special attention is paid to ensure that all families and children feel welcome, that their culture is acknowledged and supported and that they feel their contribution is valued.</p><p>Teachers have worked hard to build their knowledge and skills in Te Ao Māori. They plan ways to support children to become familiar with New Zealand’s bicultural heritage. Maori concepts are evident in documents and children’s profile books. This learning is beginning to emerge in the programme with increasing participation by parents and children. This area of development is ongoing.</p><p>Teachers have good systems for managing, tracking and monitoring children’s learning. The children’s profile books show clearly what learning is valued by the community. The parents that ERO spoke with expressed appreciation for profile books and said they support their relationship with the teachers and encourage them to reflect on their child’s educational experiences.</p><p>The teaching team reflects in depth on what they do to help children develop and learn and they are focused on improvement. The teachers are motivated to learn and to participate in regular ongoing professional development. They creatively problem solve to find solutions to a range of complex situations that arise due to the nature of the service. Through an ongoing process of review, they have identified aspects of the programme and their practices that can be further refined. These include bicultural development and the integration of a Māori dimension, clarity of learning intentions and building parents’ understanding of the programme. A greater focus on evaluation will further strengthen the review process.</p><h3>Governance and Leadership</h3><p><em>Governance.</em> The board and general manager work well together to ensure that the association is well governed and well managed. Board members have useful ongoing training to help them understand their roles and responsibilities. There are comprehensive policies and procedures to guide the operations of the association and effective monitoring systems. There is alignment between the association reviews and the kindergarten reviews.</p><p>The board has a clear vision and strategic plan to guide the association’s future. It has identified that the upcoming review of the strategic plan will include a focus on outcomes for children. The board, general manager, and teachers have actively sought ways to engage with local iwi and to build bicultural practices across the association. It would be useful to include bicultural development in the strategic plan to sustain and enhance the progress that has been made.</p><p><em>Association support for the Kindergarten.</em> The general manager and senior teacher provide strong professional leadership to the two kindergarten services. They visit each site regularly and visits are followed by detailed reports and actions and reflections for the teams to consider.</p><p>The teachers, general manager, senior teacher, board members and parents communicate frequently and work well together. There is a well-established culture of ongoing professional development and reflection within the organisation. The association is very supportive of emerging leadership amongst the teaching teams.</p><p><em>Management of Mobile kindergarten.</em> The head teacher provides strong leadership within her team. She and the teacher-aides have developed effective and efficient systems to manage the complexity of delivering an early childhood service to the various rural sites and to widely diverse communities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p><em>Appraisals.</em> Further develop the process to better show the input from the appraiser.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waimate Mobile Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waimate Mobile Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>19 June 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
