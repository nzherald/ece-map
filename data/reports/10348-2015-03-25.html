</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Albany Rua in Albany, Auckland is owned and operated by Kidicorp Ltd. The centre is licensed for up to 50 children over the age of two years. Two separate rooms provide age appropriate learning environments for children from three to four years, and four to five years. Flexibility in programmes and in use of resources and space ensures that children also have many opportunities to interact with all staff and children in the centre.</p><p>The cultural diversity of the local community is reflected in the children and families at the centre. Centre staff are committed to developing strong relationships and effective communication with families and whānau. Parents report positive feedback about the care and education their children receive.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO report there have been changes in centre management. The centre manager appointed in 2013 has been well supported from Kidicorp personnel to initiate significant changes in operations, teaching and learning programmes and environment. The centre is now well placed to consolidate these improvements. The head teacher has recently been appointed to the position centre manager.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive relationships are evident between teachers and children, and between children of different ages. Children are settled and engaged in their play. They enjoy good opportunities for sustained and imaginative play. Teachers are responsive to and build on children’s ideas. They provide opportunities for both independent and collaborative play, and enhance children’s social skills through positive guidance and modelling.</p><p>Learning programmes are underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The notice, recognise and respond approach to planning builds on children’s emerging interests. Good foundations have been developed to build teachers’ understanding and implementation of this approach, including systems to document individual and group planning and assessment. Centre managers are continuing to develop strategies to further enhance assessment and planning practices and to increase the depth and quality of teaching and learning.</p><p>The centre is well resourced. The spacious environment is organised into discrete areas of play where children are able to play independently or co-operatively. Recent review and development of the indoor and outdoor learning spaces and resources has increased opportunities for exploration, choice and challenge. Teachers could now consider providing more opportunities for literacy and mathematics in the outdoor learning areas, and ensuring that wall displays are meaningful and accessible for children.</p><p>Staff are continuing to explore ways to extend learning partnerships with family and whānau. The planned introduction of an electronic system for sharing children’s learning has the potential to enhance communication and enable greater parent input into their child’s learning.</p><p>Well considered transition processes support children as they move into the centre and between rooms in the centre. Staff are building good relationships with local schools and recognise that extending this contact would be positive for children and their families.</p><p>Children’s cultural backgrounds are recognised and valued. These could be further reflected in centre resources and programmes. Managers have identified the need to review and strengthen ways in which the centre reflects the bicultural heritage of New Zealand. This next step should include reviewing the centre philosophy to acknowledge Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and seeking whānau and community voice in further development of bicultural practices.</p><p>Kidicorp governance and management systems, policies and procedures provide a strong framework for operations. Centre systems support and complement these overarching structures effectively. Managers continue to review and strengthen systems and procedures to ensure they are relevant to the centre context and are useful working documents to guide practice and build capability.</p><p>Good systems and structures continue to support a culture of reflection and review in the centre. Useful strategic planning and self review processes have been established and managers are continuing to refine and extend these. There is increasingly clarity and alignment of systems such as strategic and annual planning, teacher appraisal, and professional learning and development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers are committed to ongoing improvement. They are developing strategies to maintain consistency through the current change of leadership and to continue to build leadership capability. The centre should now focus on maintaining momentum to embed and sustain recent positive developments.</p><p>ERO affirms the centre’s plans to:</p><ul>
<li>enhance bicultural practices to better meet their obligations under Te Tiriti o Waitangi</li>
<li>continue to increase the depth and quality of teaching and learning</li>
<li>embed and extend recently developed appraisal processes</li>
<li>continue to extend the use of self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Albany Rua completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Albany Rua will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>25 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
