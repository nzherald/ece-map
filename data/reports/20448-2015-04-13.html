</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Green Bay Early Childhood Centre is located in the grounds of Motu Moana in Green Bay, Auckland. It continues to provide high quality education and care for up to 27 children from two to five years of age. Children and their families have flexible options for sessional or full day education and care. The attractive physical environment, with its views of the Manukau Harbour and neighbouring parks, is inviting and well maintained.</p><p>In January 2015 the centre was purchased by new owners who will oversee the management and governance of the centre. A curriculum manager and financial manager, appointed by the new owners, plan to meet fortnightly with the supervisor and systems are in place for regular communication between the management group. The centre has a team of qualified and loyal staff.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report noted the strong link between the centre’s philosophy and practice that indicated good leadership. The effective integration of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, with the values of the centre’s parents and families was also evident. These aspects of good practice have been maintained and further strengthened.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging. They are able to select and use equipment, and make decisions about their own learning. Children are confident and competent learners and are developing good social skills. Children play cooperatively and participate well in the centre programme. They have many opportunities for physical challenge and engage in imaginative play for extended periods of time.</p><p>Children enjoy an open-ended, play-based curriculum that has clear links to <em>Te Whāriki</em>. They have extensive opportunities to learn and lead their own play. The learning environment is stimulating, provokes children’s interest, and is set up in ways that contribute to the high quality of children’s learning and play. Teachers have reduced unnecessary interruptions in the programme, and could now review the way that group times are organised so that all children can participate in the sharing of significant learning and experiences.</p><p>A distinguishing feature of the centre is the strong partnerships with parents and families. Teachers value parents’ knowledge and understanding about their own children and cultural backgrounds. Parents have many opportunities to share information and be involved in their children’s learning and development.</p><p>The centre philosophy and planning show a strong commitment to biculturalism and to supporting children to develop an appreciation for New Zealand’s dual cultural heritage. Teachers are committed to integrating te reo and tikanga Māori into the programme, and to drawing on skills and expertise from parents and families. Good effort has been made to use bilingual signage for resources and to provide opportunities for children to sing waiata and learn about Māori legends. Māori parents report positively about the centre’s inclusiveness and the support for their children’s identity, language and culture.</p><p>Planning is responsive to children’s individual interests and strengths and it is well documented. The emphasis in teachers’ assessment of children’s learning is on identifying their individual development over time. Teachers could now explore how sharing children’s assessment records electronically could further encourage parent involvement in their children’s learning and development.</p><p>The supervisor has a clear vision and philosophy and is very thoughtful and considered about centre leadership. She has high expectations of staff and for children’s learning and is proactive about keeping up to date with current educational theory and practice. Self-review is effective and contributes to ongoing improvement. Operational plans are well documented and could be further strengthened by including strategic goals. These goals could then be reviewed to evaluate the effectiveness of centre practices. The supervisor should also consider providing staff with more formal opportunities to meet, share professional goals and build capability. With the introduction of the centre’s new management structure, the challenge is to work collaboratively through this transition period.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre management, the supervisor and teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>review group times so that all children can be engaged more meaningfully</li>
<li>continue to review and develop the ways that children’s assessment information is shared with parents</li>
<li>work collaboratively to transition into the new centre management, operations and expectations.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Green Bay Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Green Bay Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>13 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
