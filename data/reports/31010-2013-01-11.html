<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The centre continues to be well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Pukeatua Playcentre is a parent-led centre that provides education and care for children from birth up to school age, for two mornings a week. The centre is located close to Pukeatua School, near Te Awamutu, and continues to maintain a positive and reciprocal relationship with the school.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of the King Country Playcentre Association. In accordance with playcentre philosophy, parents are committed to providing sessions in which children choose and initiate play and children and families learn together. Members receive valuable, ongoing support from experienced and knowledgeable association personnel, including centre support staff, the property manager and kaiawhina.</p><p>The previous ERO report acknowledged members&rsquo; positive relationships and learning interactions with children, and the well-equipped learning environment. It suggested that members more clearly identify children&rsquo;s learning and progress and use this information to plan the programme.</p><p>Several experienced members have recently left the centre. Members are keen to raise playcentre training levels to meet session funding requirements and further enhance learning outcomes for children.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in ten early childhood education services within the King Country Playcentre Associaton umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Children enjoy positive, respectful and caring interactions with adults and each other. Parents are responsive to children&rsquo;s requests, suggestions, ideas and interests. They willingly share information about their children and plan the programme and environment to extend and enrich learning. Some members effectively model how to notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s interests and learning in portfolios.</p><p>Members support older children to:</p><ul>
<li>develop social and leadership skills, such as cooperation, consideration and inclusion of younger children</li>
<li>talk about their play and experiences</li>
<li>identify and solve problems</li>
<li>experiment with music, and explore aspects of literacy, scientific and mathematical learning in meaningful ways.</li>
</ul><p>Children are capable and competent learners and communicators. Children under two years are fully engaged in the programme. They confidently explore the environment, participate in group activities and access the support of older children and adults.</p><p>Members collectively identify goals for future development, and take on multiple leadership roles to facilitate progress. A feature of centre management is the wide pool of knowledge, skills and experience that members contribute from their diverse backgrounds. They highly value playcentre training and professional development, and make good use of the knowledge they gain to improve the quality of the learning environment, and their interactions with children.</p><p>Areas for development and review</p><p>ERO agrees with centre members&rsquo; identified priorities to:</p><ul>
<li>review their strategic priorities in the light of significant membership changes</li>
<li>strengthen self-review</li>
<li>further increase their confidence to incorporate te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in the learning programme.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pukeatua Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>11 January 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
