</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Montessori Herne Bay provides education and care for up to 41 children from 12 months to school age. The centre layout comprises of two areas: Tui providing for younger children, and Kea for older children. Younger children transition to the older age group around three years of age. The centre occupies well maintained premises with good facilities for staff. Nutritious meals are prepared on site by the centre’s cook.</p><p>The centre operates within the policies and management framework of the BestStart Education and Care Centres organisation, which provides an overarching governance and management framework as well as personnel to support individual centres. BestStart managers visit regularly and provide professional advice for the centre manager and teachers.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report identified good practices that have been maintained. Areas for development focused on improvements to the outdoor area and strengthening assessment and programme planning.</p><p>Since ERO’s 2013 review, a centre manager has been appointed and there have been changes in staffing. The outdoor area has been redeveloped and attractively landscaped. Most teachers are qualified and registered and continue to be involved in professional development.</p><p>The centre’s strong Montessori method and <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, guide the programme and teaching practices. Respect and independence are core features of the centre philosophy. School readiness is promoted through everyday learning experiences and the 'Be School Ready' programme.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have fun, and are innovative, engaged learners. They are self managing, caring and respectful of others. The centre is extensively resourced with Montessori and general early childhood resources. The large outdoor area has wide variety of learning areas that invite children to investigate and explore. Teachers encourage children's physical activity and opportunities for problem solving and creativity. They skilfully support the development of children's ability to lead and join in group activities, and to use literacy, mathematics, and science in meaningful ways.</p><p>Teachers understand and provide well for the special characteristics and interests of very young children. They provide nurturing individualised care with good learning opportunities. Infants and toddlers are confident, explore freely and are trusting of adults and older children. They play and learn at a relaxed pace in a calm, supportive environment.</p><p>Teachers plan and implement a rich, responsive curriculum with a strong Montessori approach. Planning is influenced by current theories and research and builds on children’s interests. Children’s assessment portfolios are highly valued records of learning and development. Parents are provided with good information about the curriculum and encouraged to contribute their ideas and aspirations for their child's learning.</p><p>Skilful and supportive teaching practices affirm and build on the strengths children bring. Teachers model the Montessori philosophy and interact with respect. They acknowledge children’s cultural backgrounds, are inclusive, and adapt the environment to meet children's needs. Teachers manage children’s transitions through the centre carefully and are responsive to individual children's and family needs. Teachers encourage environmental sustainability and healthy lifestyles. Bicultural practices and use of te reo Māori are woven through aspects of the programme.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively and benefit from the centre manager’s professional leadership. Their teaching capabilities are fostered through sound appraisal processes and ongoing professional development. They are enthusiastic, improvement focused and work in partnership with parents.</p><p>A strong focus on children and families with a clear shared vision underpins centre practices. Self review is developing, guiding decision making and contributing to centre improvement.</p><p>The centre manager is very well supported by BestStart personnel. BestStart has useful systems for monitoring centre operations. These include regular management meetings and an internal audit process (QEC) which is used to identify challenges and develop plans for improvement. In addition, the centre has a strategic plan that is linked to the BestStart vision and strategic plan, as well as to the centre's philosophy statement, an annual management plan and QEC action plans.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager and ERO agree that internal evaluation is an area to develop further, and that teachers could:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>more consistently document how they reflect on and evaluate their teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen their bicultural knowledge and practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Montessori Herne Bay completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Montessori Herne Bay will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>24 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
