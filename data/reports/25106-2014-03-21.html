<a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Tamariki Takitumu Punanga Reo governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the September 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>the quality of the programme for children including extending children’s learning</li>
<li>the quality of self review</li>
<li>the quality of management systems, including effective practices</li>
<li>any other issues relevant to the governance, management and operation of the service that arise during the course of this review.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Tamariki Takitumu Punanga Reo in Mangere, Auckland, provides education and care for up to 30 children, including five under two years of age. It is governed by the Tamariki Takitumu Punanga Reo Educational Trust. The centre provides a bilingual learning environment for children and families where Rarotonga reo Cook Island language and culture is valued and promoted.</p><p>The centre has had five ERO reviews over the last five years. ERO’s September 2012 report identified areas of concern around the quality of governance and management processes, the learning programme and the quality of teaching. Since then, the centre has responded well and made significant progress.</p><p>Over the past year a new leadership team has been established and includes a supervisor and curriculum leader. A newly appointed te reo Kuki Airani teacher provides support and expertise for children and adults. Teachers have also been involved in professional development to build their knowledge and understanding of programme planning and extending children’s learning. The centre manager and teachers have shown commitment to improving centre practice. The centre is now well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>Children experience affirming, respectful relationships with adults and each other. Adults are responsive to children’s care and learning needs. A greater focus on learning has resulted in children becoming engaged in their play. Children make independent choices about their play and move freely throughout the centre. They benefit from the inclusion of te reo Kuki Airani which is used by teachers in a calm and meaningful way. Strong inclusive practices enhance children’s wellbeing. This contributes to a healthy sense of belonging for children and their families.</p><p>Children and toddlers benefit from well resourced learning environments. They access a variety of resources that are reflective of Cook Island and New Zealand cultures and that support their learning. The thoughtful layout of learning spaces provides good opportunities for exploration and creativity. Equipment is accessible and well displayed in all areas of play. The print rich te reo Kuki Airani is strongly evident throughout the centre and aids both children and teachers' language development.</p><p>The centre manager has been proactive in developing a distributed leadership model to improve outcomes for children. He works in partnership with the supervisor and curriculum leader to oversee centre operations. Teachers' strengths and skills are valued and utilised in the programme. As a result teachers' leadership skills are contributing to the sustainability of the centre and promoting a sense of shared ownership among teachers. New learning from professional development has improved teaching practice and has built confidence in the team.</p><p>Teachers plan formally to promote positive outcomes for children. Children’s learning and assessment portfolios provide good evidence of their learning and development. Evidence of teachers' reflective practices and documentation of children’s individual and group interests can be seen in planning folders and on centre walls. Teachers are aware of the need to continue to strengthen planning and assessment practices. Plans are in place to further develop processes to consult with parents about their child’s learning.</p><p>The manager and teachers have established self-review processes that are helping to strengthen the quality of leadership and teaching practices. The centre philosophy is reviewed regularly and is reflected well in the programme. The strategic and annual plans have been developed and guide centre operations.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>The centre manager and teachers are committed to improve practices and agree that areas for further improvement should include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to formalise appraisal processes to ensure effective practices are embedded in centre culture</li>
<li>accessing whole-centre professional development to increase understanding of self-review processes</li>
<li>continuing to develop and refine planning and assessment processes</li>
<li>improving financial accounting processes, in line with the auditors' recommendation.</li>
</ul><a id="3-actions-required-for-compliance" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Actions Required for Compliance</h2><p>In order to meet its agreed accountabilities, centre management must:</p><ul>
<li>ensure that all non registered staff are regularly police vetted <em>[Education Act 1989, s315].</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tamariki Takitumu Punanga Reo will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>21 March 2014</p><a id="information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Service</h2><table>
