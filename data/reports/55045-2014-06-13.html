</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>St Matthews Early Childhood Centre is located near the central business district of Hastings. It is one of a number of centres governed by Anglican Care Waiapu, whose purpose is to deliver and support high quality Christian social services.</p><p>The centre’s focus is to provide education and care in a Christian environment that supports children as independent learners.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 35 children from birth to school entry. It successfully provides for mixed ages. The diverse backgrounds of the children are celebrated. Most children identify as Māori and are well supported. Centre practices reflect the principles of <em>Te Tiriti o Waitangi</em>.</p><p>The centre has a good reporting history with ERO and continues to provide the high quality education and care reported in the August 2011 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>St Matthews Early Childhood Centre is very well placed to continue to promote positive learning outcomes for children. There are robust structures and practices in place to provide for each of the diverse learners and their families. The centre philosophy includes a commitment to extend and develop children’s knowledge, enhance their cultural awareness and enable them to be confident and independent. This is strongly evident in practice.</p><p>The small roll and the high ratio of teachers to children enable each child to be individually recognised. The centre is welcoming and there are positive relationships between parents and teachers.</p><p>Long-serving teachers are dedicated and enjoy challenges. Capable leadership and collaborative planning enable an appropriate learning programme, based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum that focuses on children’s interests.</p><p>High quality interactions and effective teaching continue to be evident. Mutually respectful practices result in a calm nurturing atmosphere where children, parents and families feel welcome and valued. Children’s learning is successfully extended through conversations. Language is valued and children enjoy reading and listening to the range of appropriate books available, including some in te reo Māori.</p><p>The centre has a strong focus on supporting Māori children to be successful, as Māori. Teachers’ professional development is supported by the governors' Māori advisor. Their knowledge, the environment and resources, assist in the provision of a culturally responsive curriculum.</p><p>The centre has a very well-developed self-review programme. Self review is used effectively to determine priorities for continuing to improve the centre's provision for children and families. Outcomes confirm current practice and lead to positive change.</p><p>A current review focus is to improve the quality of the outdoor environment. Considerable planning and fundraising are supporting this initiative. ERO's evaluation affirms that redevelopment of this environment is timely.</p><p>The mixed-age centre provides challenges for the younger children who are well looked after, and included, by the older children. There are opportunities for children up to the age of three to have their own time and space. They are supported by teachers who are responsive to the expectations of parents and each child’s needs and interests.</p><p>Transitions into the centre are carefully planned and sensitively managed. Teachers discuss with parents the child’s background, interests and needs. They ask about parents' expectations, aspirations and relevant cultural practices.</p><p>There is a close relationship with the neighbouring St Matthew's School. The centre staff facilitate transition visits and sharing of children's strengths and interests with the new entrant teacher.</p><p>Self review is sufficiently robust for the centre to be self improving. Effective teaching practice, dedication of teachers and the valuable support of governors sustain the provision of positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of St Matthews Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of St Matthews Early Childhood Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><p>13 June 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
