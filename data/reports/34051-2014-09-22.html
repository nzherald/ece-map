</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Beachkids Waihi Beach is a long established education and care centre located in the village of Waihi Beach. The centre is licensed for 32 children including 8 under two. At the time of this ERO review the centre’s roll of 42 children included 2 who identify as Māori. The centre’s philosophy makes a commitment to a safe, secure environment that provides both challenges and predictable happenings, with opportunities for independent exploration and movement.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in November 2011, the centre has been reorganised with children over the age of 4 now attending a separately licensed Beachkids pre-school facility at a neighbouring location. This allows more space and increased opportunities for children up to the age of 4. The centre operates two aged-based areas – one for children under 2 and one for children 2 to 4 years of age. Each age-based area has a separate head teacher and the centre owner undertakes the role of overall centre manager. There have been some changes to the teaching team and a new head teacher for the over 2 area was appointed at the beginning of 2014. The centre has six qualified teachers and two are currently in training.</p><p>The centre has a positive ERO reporting history.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Beachkids Waihi Beach is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Children benefit from a programme that responds to their interests, strengths and abilities. Their care needs are well met and reflect parent’s aspirations. A special feature of the centre is the opportunities to play and learn in environments that reflect New Zealand’s natural heritage. In particular children enjoy frequent learning experiences at the nearby beach, and visits to places of interest in the local and wider communities.</p><p>There are many opportunities for children to explore and experience safe physical challenges in the centre’s outdoor areas. Children’s literacy, mathematics and science learning is naturally integrated through their self-directed play. Each child’s creativity is encouraged and celebrated in meaningful ways.</p><p>Māori language, culture and identity is valued and affirmed through the effective integration of te reo Māori in everyday routines and conversations. This creates a sense of belonging and connectedness for the Māori children and whānau attending the centre, and extends to the wider community of parents through the celebration of events such as Matariki.</p><p>Individual learning profiles provide a useful record of children’s participation in the programme. They are easily accessible for children to be able to reflect on their learning and are valued by parents. These profiles are increasingly identifying each child’s learning and are tracking progress over time.</p><p>Teachers provide a warm and welcoming environment for children. The positive and affirming relationships that they establish with children supports the centre’s calm and settled learning environment. Teachers have a wide variety of experiences and knowledge, and work well together in the best interests of children and their families. They actively involve themselves alongside children to extend their play. ERO observed teachers using a wide range of effective teaching strategies that:</p><ul>
<li>support the development of children’s self esteem</li>
<li>promote children’s independence, self care and problem-solving skills</li>
<li>extend children’s oral language ability</li>
<li>actively promote positive interactions between children</li>
<li>encourage children to share their knowledge and previous learning.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers deliberately plan to build on and extend children’s interests. This planning is shared with parents, and supports the development of learning partnerships with families.</p><p>Children in the under two area experience nurturing relationships and a strong sense of aroha with their teachers. These young children experience a programme that is responsive to parent’s aspirations and home routines. This close partnership with families contributes to a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging for children.</p><p>The centre owner’s commitment to providing a quality service is evident in the support that she provides for teachers, the low children-to-teacher ratios, and the quality of the resources that are available for children. She has developed a very useful policy framework to guide centre operations.</p><p>The two head teachers are experienced, effective teachers and are knowledgeable about early childhood education. They work collaboratively with the centre owner, teachers and parents. The head teachers have extended their knowledge of te reo and tikanga Māori, and have successfully led increased bicultural practices at the centre. Together with the centre owner they have developed some useful self-review processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre owner agree that the key next step for the centre is to implement a more long term approach to centre development. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>accessing centre-wide professional development for teachers to further develop aspects of their assessment, planning and evaluation practices</li>
<li>implementing a robust teacher appraisal process that provides teachers with regular feedback about their practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Beachkids Waihi Beach completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Beachkids Waihi Beach will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>22 September 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
