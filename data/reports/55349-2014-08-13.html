</table><p>This service needs to establish clear expectations for governance and management roles and responsibilities. It also should develop sustainable systems and processes that improve teaching practice and learning experiences for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tutira Early Childhood Centre is situated in a rural community of Tutira, 45 kilometres north of Napier. It operates from the community hall six hours a day, three days per week. Education and care is provided for 30 children, including five up to the age of two years. At the time of this review, 47% of children identified as Māori. Children up to two years of age attend with their parents.</p><p>The centre is governed by a parent committee. A team leader has oversight of the curriculum and teaching team. The centre has undergone some staff changes and the current team was established in term one, 2014. All teachers are qualified and two are provisionally registered. The team leader is new to the leadership role.</p><p>The centre philosophy expresses a belief in children being confident and competent learners, who learn best through play and achievable, challenging experiences.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate enthusiastically in a child-centred, play-based programme. Routines provide a useful framework for the day and give children a sense of security. This approach supports children’s sense of belonging. Their independence is promoted.</p><p>Teachers have warm, responsive and respectful relationships with children and parents. They know children and their families well and use this knowledge to make meaningful links between the centre programme and the child’s world. Teachers work alongside children following their self-initiated interests and extending their learning. Aspects of literacy and numeracy are evident in the programme. Teachers have identified that these curriculum areas can continue to be strengthened.</p><p>The centre is a valuable point of contact for families in this rural community. The team leader works collaboratively with the committee and staff to operate the centre and provide an education and care programme. Parents contribute to the programme and participate in a range of centre activities.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to the specific requirements of infants and toddlers. They have made appropriate changes to the physical environment to accommodate their needs.</p><p>Procedures to support children’s transition to school are developing. Teachers should investigate how they can make more explicit the value of children learning through play in early childhood and how this supports their future success in school.</p><p>Excursions into the local community enrich the programme. Teachers need to be clear about the purpose of these visits and develop links to the centre programme. Leaders must ensure that all legal requirements for managing excursions are met.</p><p>Children’s profiles show their participation in the programme and at times they highlight their emerging interests. Teachers should continue to strengthen these records of learning to show how they extend children's skills and knowledge. Parents' aspirations should also be sought and reflected through their child’s profiles.</p><p>A bicultural programme is developing, but should continue to be strengthened. Aspects of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are evident within the programme. An appropriate range of strategies to promote success for Māori as Māori have been identified. Consultation with whānau to develop these ideas further is needed.</p><p>Appropriate professional development has been accessed by all staff. Provisionally registered teachers are supported in an informal way by the team leader. However, other processes to improve the provision of education and care require development. The appraisal process is not yet implemented effectively enough to improve teacher practice. The team leader position description should be reviewed and linked to the appraisal process. Committee roles and responsibilities require further clarification. The programme of induction and mentoring for provisionally registered teachers should be formalised so that expectations are clear for involved parties.</p><p>Self review is in the early stages of development. Teachers should continue to strengthen their understanding of the self-review process and their knowledge of evaluation. This should provide additional information to monitor the effectiveness of centre operations and practice and guide future decision making.</p><p>Although a regular cycle of policy review is evident, there is a lack of clarity about policies that are required to guide the centre. Leaders should ensure they have a clear understanding of what policies are necessary to meet the requirements of the licensing criteria and other regulations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The parent committee and teachers should clarify the roles of governance and management, and develop sustainable systems that improve teaching practice. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>enhancing assessment, planning and evaluation and strengthening self review</li>
<li>extending the bicultural nature of the curriculum and consulting with Māori families about their aspirations</li>
<li>developing processes that build and support teachers' professional practice</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening the process for managing transition to school</p>
</li>
<li>ensuring they have the required policies of an early childhood service.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tutira Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management, and health and safety. The service provider must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>there are suitable human resource management practices including job descriptions and a system of regular appraisal</li>
<li>whenever children leave the premises on an outing or excursions, assessment and management of risks is undertaken and adult and child ratios are determined</li>
<li>heavy furniture, fixtures and equipment that could fall or topple and cause serious injury or damage are secured</li>
<li>a clear procedure for responding to suspected child abuse is established.</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008 GMA7 &amp; R 46, 1 (a, c)]</em></p><p>Additionally:</p><ul>
<li>include in the service's annual report, a statement about how Equity Funding has been spent.</li>
</ul><p><em>[Early Childhood Funding Handbook- Chapter 10, Equity Funding.] </em></p><p>To improve practice, management should ensure that when children are travelling in private motor vehicles the driver has a current drivers licence, vehicle registration and warrant of fitness.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry of Education support this service to plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tutira Early Childhood Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><p>13 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</span></h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
