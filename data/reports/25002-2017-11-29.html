</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Whare Punanga Takawaenga Atawhai O Aorere, Aorere College Childcare Centre provides early childhood education for up to 40 children from birth to five years of age, including up to six children aged under two years. Children play in a mixed age environment where tuakana/teina relationships are valued. Most children have Māori or Pacific heritage.</p><p>The service has had recent staff changes. The newly appointed manager and assistant manager are ably supported by long-serving staff. They are developing as a new team. Teachers make use of the spacious indoor and outdoor environments to provide planned and free play activities for children. Separate indoor spaces are available for babies and toddlers to explore their environment freely.</p><p>The service's philosophy values individual children's holistic development and partnerships with parents/whānau. The philosophy emphasises the provision of a secure and stimulating environment that encourages responsive and reciprocal relationships.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report noted that good progress had been made since 2012. Managers have worked with staff to address the key next steps identified in the 2014 report, which included development in curriculum management, evaluation and leadership.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive relationships between children and adults are highly valued. Children and their whānau are warmly welcomed and have a sense of belonging in the centre. Children with additional needs receive responsive care and feel secure in the centre.</p><p>Children are well cared for and engaged in learning. They are encouraged to make choices in their play and select from a wide variety of appropriate equipment and activities that teachers prepare for them. Teachers promote literacy and numeracy learning in many ways while children are engaged in play. There is an appropriate emphasis on oral language development. Children focus on their activities for extended periods and there are good opportunities for creativity, challenge and exploration.</p><p>Teachers promote the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand throughout the programme. They encourage te reo Māori incidentally during conversations and more formally at mat times. Waiata and aspects of tikanga Māori are integrated at appropriate times.</p><p>Many children are learning English as an additional language. Some children converse with teachers in their home languages, which are respected and promoted in the centre. Resources that celebrate Pacific culture are providing a sense of belonging for all children of Pacific heritage.</p><p>Supportive and nurturing strategies are used to help children move smoothly into and through the service. The teaching team is focused on developing stronger links with local schools to benefit children as they move out of the service. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the programme for four-year-olds could help teachers to strengthen their support for children as they prepare to transition to school.</p><p>Managers and teachers strongly value their growing partnerships with parents/whānau. Parents' aspirations are prioritised and used to inform children's individualised programmes of learning. Managers are experimenting with ways to encourage more regular attendance.</p><p>Teachers have participated in useful external professional learning to continue building their capacity, and to develop consistency with planning and assessing children's individual learning progress. Their approaches pay particular attention to children's strengths and interests, and support children's needs and learning progress. Teachers are investigating ways to enhance their support for children's individual skills, knowledge and learning dispositions.</p><p>The managers have established a vision and strategic direction for the service. A useful policy framework guides centre operations. Managers are increasing teachers' capacity by encouraging reflective practice and improving performance appraisal processes. Provisionally registered teachers receive good support. Useful internal evaluation processes have been implemented. A recent review has resulted in the development of a policy around healthy and nutritious eating.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers agree that next steps to continue fostering positive outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>building a shared understanding of the centre's philosophy to promote consistently high quality teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>considering further ways to assess and promote children's progress with their learning dispositions and skills for independence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation by identifying measures for determining the effectiveness, usefulness, or value of a strategy or programme.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Whare Punanga Takawaenga Atawhai O Aorere, Aorere College Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Whare Punanga Takawaenga Atawhai O Aorere, Aorere College Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>29 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
