</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Kamo Kindergarten, located north of Whang&#257;rei, provides six hour sessions for up to 30 children between two and five years of age. Half of the children enrolled have M&#257;ori heritage. The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy is based on respectful relationships that celebrate the languages and cultures of children and families/wh&#257;nau.</p><p>In the past three years the kindergarten has undergone change. The kindergarten was renamed Te Kamo Kindergarten in 2014. The roll reduced and session hours were extended to meet the changing needs of the community.</p><p>A new teaching team has worked to maintain the positive features identified in ERO&rsquo;s 2012 report. These include providing a programme that is responsive to children&rsquo;s interests and further strengthening partnerships with families/wh&#257;nau. The outdoor environment and resources have been enhanced.</p><p>The kindergarten operates as part of the Northland Kindergarten Association. The Association provides governance, leadership and policy frameworks to meet operational management expectations. Association personnel assist teachers to maintain good standards of health and safety and to improve the quality of educational programmes. The Association&rsquo;s <em>P&#363;manawatanga</em> Plan reflects a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and support for the development of bicultural practices across the organisation.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 kindergarten reviews in the Northland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident communicators who develop respectful friendships and positive relationships with teachers and other children. They negotiate, problem-solve and ask questions to direct their own learning. Flexible routines support children&rsquo;s decision-making and uninterrupted play.</p><p>Children demonstrate a sense of belonging. They enjoy opportunities to take on leadership roles. Children are becoming increasingly knowledgeable about M&#257;ori protocol, including mihi whakatau, karakia and waiata. M&#257;ori children experience an environment where te reo me ona tikanga M&#257;ori is an authentic and valued part of the kindergarten&rsquo;s programme.</p><p>Teachers warmly welcome children and their families. They interact respectfully with and listen carefully to children, providing resources to support their exploration and learning. As a result of professional learning, teaching practices empower children to take responsibility for and manage their own behaviour. Teachers are committed to increasing their knowledge of tikanga and use of te reo M&#257;ori in the programme.</p><p>The programme reflects <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and promotes positive outcomes for children. Teachers work together to respond to children&rsquo;s individual and group interests. Systems to assess and plan for children&rsquo;s learning are evident. Children&rsquo;s strengths, interests and participation in the programme are clearly shown in attractive learning records.</p><p>Teachers value the information that parents share about their child&rsquo;s home and community experiences. Teachers are working deliberately to further enhance positive relationships with families. More regularly seeking parent&rsquo;s aspirations and sharing how parents' suggestions have been responded to could further strengthen partnerships with families.</p><p>The teaching team is continuing to develop a shared understanding about effective teaching practices. Individual skills and strengths are contributing to team development. Teacher appraisal and self-review systems are used well to reflect on progress. Clearly defined long-term and annual goals guide ongoing improvement.</p><p>The Northland Kindergarten Association provides effective governance for kindergartens. Its long-term direction focuses on making decisions to improve learning outcomes for children. Positive strategies include:</p><ul>
<li>good support and guidance from Association personnel to improve the quality of kindergarten programmes and teaching practice, particularly the development of bicultural practices and integration of <em>Te Ao M&#257;ori</em> (the M&#257;ori world) into programmes in meaningful ways for children</li>
<li>effective teacher appraisal and professional learning and development that contributes to improved teacher skills, knowledge and practice, especially in supporting children&rsquo;s social competence and strengthening the quality of assessment documentation</li>
<li>significant investment in property and environment upgrades to promote children&rsquo;s exploration and investigation</li>
<li>a focus on distributed leadership practices amongst kindergarten teaching teams to utilise teachers&rsquo; individual and collective strengths.</li>
</ul><p>Association leaders are considering ways to enhance teacher appraisal processes and systems for self review. ERO recommends that the Association strengthens systems to ensure that all health and safety requirements are being implemented.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To build on existing good practices teachers agree they could:</p><ul>
<li>continue to build shared team understandings of effective teaching</li>
<li>strengthen self review by improving the quality of evaluation practices</li>
<li>use parent/wh&#257;nau aspirations and feedback to enhance children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>work with local schools to review how well children are supported to transition to school.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Kamo Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practices, the service provider should ensure that teachers implement earthquake evacuation procedures, as previously identified in ERO&rsquo;s 2012 report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h3>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h3><p>The next ERO review of Te Kamo Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>9 September 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
