<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Topkids Waihi Road governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the December 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>centre management and leadership</li>
<li>relationship management</li>
<li>self review leading to improved outcomes</li>
<li>teachers' professional learning</li>
<li>staff performance management.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>TopKids Waihi Road is located in Tauranga in a purpose-built facility owned and operated by Kidicorp Ltd. The centre is licensed to provide all-day education and care for up to 72 children aged from birth to school age. At the time of this ERO review there were 101 children on the roll of whom 22 identify as M&#257;ori.</p><p>The December 2012 ERO review identified aspects of centre operation and teacher practice that needed improvement. These aspects included leadership and relationship management, self review, staff professional development and appraisal. There were also concerns about the implementation of some health and safety policies and procedures.</p><p>During 2013, the service has made considerable progress in addressing these concerns. Important progress has been made in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>Kidicorp management has provided sustained and effective support for the centre manager, team leaders and teachers.</li>
<li>Relationships and communication among managers and teachers are now strong and positive.</li>
<li>Teachers are now working as a cohesive team and are using self review effectively to make decisions about centre improvement.</li>
<li>Teachers are now engaged in meaningful appraisal processes and have access to appropriate professional development focused on improving their practice.</li>
<li>The centre manager is now effectively implementing health and safety policies and procedures.</li>
</ul><p>At the time of the 2012 ERO review many teachers were in relieving positions or new to their roles. In addition, there were high levels of staff turnover. Since then the team has remained stable, roles and responsibilities are now clear, and teachers are working as an effective team.</p><a id="3-areas-of-progress" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Areas of progress</h2><h3>Centre Leadership and Relationship Management</h3><p>During 2013 the centre manager has worked closely with Kidicorp management to establish open and transparent communication, and trusting and respectful relationships. They meet regularly to discuss centre issues, celebrations and areas for ongoing improvement. These meetings are clearly documented and show the way leadership capacity has been enhanced in the centre. In addition, the centre manager has undertaken professional development about leadership, which is contributing to her improved understanding of her role as the professional leader of the service. Kidicorp is committed to continuing to build leadership capacity in the centre.</p><p>Kidicorp provided external support to undertake a team building programme with all staff. As a result teachers and management now have improved relationships and collaboratively provide quality education and care for children.</p><h3>Self review Leading to Improved Outcomes</h3><p>During 2013 teachers and centre leaders have improved their understanding of self review. Teachers have adopted a clear and consistent approach to self review. This approach considers multiple perspectives, includes a strong parent voice, reflective practice and relevant research about early childhood education. Each teacher has been responsible for reviewing a curriculum area and sharing the findings with colleagues. Teachers have also engaged in professional learning about self review and have identified other important areas for review and development.</p><h3>Teachers&rsquo; professional learning and performance management</h3><p>During 2013 processes for managing teacher performance and professional development have significantly improved. Teachers now engage in high-quality reflection and discussions about their professional growth and ways to improve the quality of education and care they provide.</p><p>The teacher appraisal process has been strengthened through close communication with centre leaders and Kidicorp managers. This has included the introduction of regular interviews with centre leaders and the setting of relevant professional learning goals for each teacher. Teachers&rsquo; priorities for professional learning are now clearly identified and appropriate programmes are provided through Kidicorp and other external experts.</p><a id="4-areas-for-further-improvement" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Areas for further improvement</h2><p>ERO, centre management and teachers have identified the need to continue to strengthen and use self review to improve educational outcomes for children.</p><a id="5-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Recommendation</h2><p>ERO recommends that:</p><ul>
<li>centre leaders and teachers continue to work closely with Kidicorp management to continually improve the quality of education and care provided.</li>
