</table><p>Maungawhau Playcentre is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Maungawhau Playcentre in Mt Eden is run as a family cooperative, providing five sessions each week for children up to school age. The centre is licensed for 30 children, including 15 children up to the age of two years. Since the 2015 ERO review, this centre has merged with a nearby Playcentre.</p><p>Centre practices are based on the Playcentre philosophy of families learning together. The centre's philosophy affirms parents as valued and best educators of their children and promotes social opportunities for children and families. Sessions are guided <em>by Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><p>The centre has a history of positive reports. Positive features identified in the 2015 ERO report continue to be strongly evident. Recommendations for enhancing practice in 2015 included strengthening self review, bicultural practices, assessment, planning and evaluation. Centre members have responded very positively to these recommendations.</p><p>The new Playcentre Aotearoa structure is now fully operational. It provides a sound management framework and support personnel to help parents/whānau to manage their centres. Playcentre Aotearoa administers centres’ funding and provides adult education programmes for parents/whānau to achieve Playcentre qualifications.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the Playcentre Aotearoa Auckland region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The learning environment is attractive and well resourced. Centre members' strengths and skills are complementary and enable them to provide a range of interesting activities to link in with the natural world. Parents/whānau encourage physically active and challenging play. Children use the extensive indoor and outdoor areas well and experience a full range of learning opportunities that provide a wide scope for imaginative and collaborative play.</p><p>Parents/whānau are a positive, guiding presence. They follow children's lead as they engage in play, responding to their conversations and providing extra resources that might bring more complexity to their thinking. Adults model oral language well, through sharing stories and conversations. They extend children's vocabulary as opportunities arise through their responses to children's interests.</p><p>Playcentre's 'whānau tupu ngātahi' philosophical approach is reflected in centre members' commitment to incorporating bicultural practices in programmes for their children. There is very effective centre leadership for this focus. Parents/whānau are becoming more confident to include te reo and waiata Māori incidentally in sessions. There are good resources within the centre to help extend centre members' knowledge of te ao Māori.</p><p>Children's portfolios reflect the Playcentre philosophy, valuing parents as first teachers. Portfolios provide good records of children's learning over time. Learning stories celebrate each child as a member of a family and the wider Playcentre whānau. Identifying the relevant links between children's learning and <em>Te Whāriki</em> would help to strengthen these records.</p><p>Centre members have adopted planned approaches to implementing the Playcentre Aotearoa policy framework. They make decisions collectively at regular meetings. Centre members have developed strategic and annual planning to guide their progress. Internal evaluation leads to change and improvement. Centre members who are engaged in higher levels of Playcentre adult education are guiding the further development of internal evaluation processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre members include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increasing the use of the language of <em>Te Whāriki</em> in documentation, to better reflect planning, assessment and evaluation discussions.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Key next steps for development in the Playcentre Aotearoa Auckland region include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening the use of internal evaluation to measure the effectiveness of systems and practices across the region.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Maungawhau Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Central)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>17 January 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
