</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tamariki Takitumu Punanga Reo in Mangere is licensed for 30 children, including up to five under two years of age. Most of the children are of Cook Islands Māori descent but few have the opportunity to speak te reo o Rarotonga in their homes. Following consultation with their parents, the centre has moved from total immersion to a multi-lingual curriculum.</p><p>Teacher-to-child ratios are high. Children under two have their own well-resourced learning spaces and spend a lot of time in the larger learning spaces of their tuākana.</p><p>The centre's philosophy has changed very little since opening in 2004 and provides a solid foundation for the positive outcomes for children that guide teaching practice.</p><p>Since the 2014 ERO report there have been many personnel changes, with the appointment of a new centre manager, new teachers and several new trustees including a new chairperson. The elected trust board meets monthly to oversee the governance of the centre and receive management reports from the centre manager and teaching staff. Trustees and centre leaders have responded well to areas for improvement identified in the 2014 ERO report. These related to staff appraisal, self review, curriculum management, financial management and police vetting processes. Some progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Tamariki, metua and ānau are warmly welcomed each day into a culturally rich Rarotongan setting. Children are keen to renew friendships as they engage in activities of choice while metua, ānau and teachers share information about children's learning.</p><p>Teachers engage with children, using respectful, warm, responsive interactions in te reo o Rarotonga. The environment has a home-like and calm atmosphere, providing a sense of security and wellbeing for children. Outdoor challenges provide good opportunities for children to develop physically. Children are settled, relaxed and engaged in the programme as they follow the things they are curious about to explore and delve into play activities.</p><p>Babies and toddlers are provided for in a separate area where their needs are met by the programme. Adults warmly affirm children as they independently explore the resources available to them. Babies and toddlers benefit from opportunities to mix with older children. Teachers need to align the planning and assessment practices in the babies' and toddlers' area with what happens for the older children.</p><p>Children know the routines well. They freely choose to play indoors or outdoors, initiate their own play and learning, often in friendly groups. There are opportunities for them to form relationships with other children while being cared for by attentive teachers, who also support them to explore aspects of literacy and numeracy. Teachers should now consider how they could extend children’s thinking and bring more complexity to their play through skilful questioning.</p><p>The programme is currently based around children’s group interests, special days on the national calendar and important cultural celebrations. Children's portfolios record their participation in these programmes, celebrating each child as a member of the wider centre whānau.</p><p>Leaders recognise that key next steps are to focus more on extending the interests of individual children and to involve parents in assessment, planning and evaluation processes. Targeted professional development will help teachers to identify their role in children's learning and make links to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The centre manager promotes improvement. Leaders continue to work on refining appraisal processes and on ensuring that effective teaching supports children's learning across the centre. More in-depth professional development for leaders will support them to embed a more robust performance management process.</p><p>Trustees bring a broad range of professional and life skills, and a commitment to their work in supporting the children who attend the centre. Trustees should reconsider their cycle of review to ensure adherence to legal requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that their next steps are to access professional development to help teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review the quality of planning, evaluation and assessment with an emphasis on children's individual learning journeys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extend children's learning through the use of meaningful interactions.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that trustees access external advisory support to develop an effective appraisal management system.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tamariki Takitumu Punanga Reo completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should review their policies and procedures to ensure they meet all current legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance. In order to address this, managers must implement a system of regular performance appraisal that meets the requirements of the Education Council of NZ.</p><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Services 2008, GMA7.</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tamariki Takitumu Punanga Reo will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>21 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
