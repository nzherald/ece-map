<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Kamo Childcare Centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. A new head teacher has been appointed since the 2010 ERO review. Continuing to strengthen management systems should enable the manager to continue ongoing improvements in the centre.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Kamo Childcare Centre Ltd 1 (Kamo Tots) is privately owned and provides care and education for children who are mostly under two years of age. Children move to Kamo Childcare Centre Ltd 2 (Kamo Kids) at a time and pace that suits the children. The centre is purpose-built and includes easy access between the indoor and outside areas.</p><p>The centre has a history of positive ERO reports. The manager and teachers have used the recommendations of the 2010 ERO report to further respond to and plan for children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Babies and toddlers settle quickly in the centre. They are supported as they play and explore the variety of activities offered both inside and in the interesting outdoor area. Teachers focus on developing children&rsquo;s confidence and help them to develop positive relationships with other children. Teachers affirm children&rsquo;s attempts at communication. Their easy relationships with children contribute to the family atmosphere of the centre.</p><p>Teachers offer a programme that is responsive to children&rsquo;s developing skills and interests and is based on Te Wh&#257;riki, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum. A well resourced and attractive environment supports cooperative play. Children&rsquo;s transitions into and from the centre are carefully managed.</p><p>Well qualified teachers work effectively as a team and maintain a calm atmosphere in the centre. The team has a strong commitment to bi-cultural practices and to strengthening relationships with parents and wh&#257;nau. Teachers include te reo M&#257;ori in conversations with children and aspects of tikanga M&#257;ori are used in daily routines. Teachers make good use of external agencies to support children who require extra assistance.</p><p>Teachers regularly participate in professional learning that has been targeted through the centre&rsquo;s self-review processes. The team reviews the centre philosophy regularly and the manager is working with a support agency to strengthen management planning. The manager is developing effective systems to support and build on the teaching team&rsquo;s skills in using self review. Teachers have opportunities to develop their leadership skills.</p><p>In order to build on the good practices already identified, the manager and teachers agree that they should:</p><ul>
<li>consult parents and wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children about their aspirations for their children</li>
<li>demonstrate the progress individual children are making in their learning</li>
<li>continue to use management systems to maintain ongoing improvements in the centre.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kamo Childcare Centre Ltd 1 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>18 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
