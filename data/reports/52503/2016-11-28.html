</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Barnardos KidStart Childcare Manawatu East Home-based Service is located in Palmerston North. It covers areas in and around Palmerston North, Levin and Whanganui. It is licensed for a maximum of 80 children, including 80 aged up to two years. At the time of this review 87 children were enrolled, and eight were Māori. Since the February 2015 ERO evaluation there have been changes to visiting teachers.</p><p>Two visiting teachers oversee and are responsible for the services. They are overseen by a team leader and are supported with their teaching and learning practice by a regional practice leader and manager. A business team provides administrative support. Barnardos New Zealand has developed a range of resources and documents to assist staff and educators in their work.</p><p>Education and care for children is provided in the educators' homes. The visiting teacher supports educators to provide suitable learning programmes for children and monitors their health and safety practices. All educators are required to have a current Barnardos Practising certificate.</p><p>Barnardos is a national organisation offering a combination of early childhood education and child and family services. The early childhood education services operate under the brand of Barnardos KidStart Childcare, which includes Barnardos KidStart Childcare Home-based services. A number of significant organisational and leadership changes at Barnardos national level have taken place recently.</p><p>The February 2015 ERO report identified that the service required further development to ensure positive outcomes for all children were promoted. Improvements required included developing and embedding good systems and processes that build service capability and sustainable practice at all levels. Next steps for governance and management identified the need to: develop a vision and philosophy for the service; define educational success for Māori and Pacific children; build leadership; provide a responsive curriculum for children aged up-to-two years; and strengthen appraisal and quality assurance systems.</p><p>In addition, at service level next steps included: defining roles and responsibilities for visiting teachers; building a sense of team within the service; strengthening assessment and planning; build evaluation capacity; and developing learning partnerships with parents.</p><p>The service received targeted support through a Ministry of Education (the Ministry) funded programme, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO). Barnardos developed a plan to address the key areas requiring improvement. The Ministry and ERO have monitored progress against this development plan since the previous 2015 ERO evaluation. The service has made good progress in addressing these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a curriculum that is based on their observed interests. In the home environment educators work positively to extend children's learning through many experiences. Regular opportunities to go out in the community and to play with other children are provided. Educators are well supported by the visiting teachers to implement the in home curriculum.</p><p>The philosophy has been recently reviewed. This forms a framework to underpin the programme, learning environment and day-to-day practice. It includes links to <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum<em>, Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em> and<em><span>Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</span></em></p><p>Infants and toddlers play and learn alongside older children and experience a sense of belonging. The service has identified that further work is needed to develop a responsive curriculum for children under two years.</p><p>Purposeful conversations occur between educators and the visiting teachers during the regular home visits. These are focused on recording children's learning and making links to <em>Te Whāriki</em>. Children's learning is recorded in a variety of ways. Educators use photographs to show what children do and learn. The integration of literacy and mathematics is promoted in meaningful ways through everyday experiences.</p><p>The visiting teachers support educators to develop positive, trusting, responsive and reciprocal relationships with children. In turn, children's social competencies are promoted.</p><p>Barnardos KidStart has provided regular workshops for educators to strengthen their assessment, planning and evaluation practice. Visiting teachers provide constructive feedback to educators about how they can extend their practice. Leaders and teachers have identified the need to continue to strengthen educators' assessment, planning and evaluation practice to better show children's progression and next steps for their learning. ERO's external evaluation affirms this direction as a key next step.</p><p>Improving learning partnerships with parents and whānau has been identified by Barnardos as a next step. Some parents provide educators with their aspirations for their children. These can guide educators in their responsiveness to children's learning needs. Enabling further opportunities for parents and whānau to share their aspirations and values for their children should better inform decisions about the curriculum.</p><p>The visiting teachers guide educators to develop confidence to actively promote educational success for Māori and Pacific children. Barnardos has developed useful te reo me ngā tikanga Māori resources to support practice. Leaders acknowledge that more work is required to develop visiting teachers' and educators' understanding of what educational success looks like for Māori and Pacific children and their families. The service is currently working with an external provider to help build their capabilities to use culturally responsive practices.</p><p>There is a clear improvement focus across the network. Quality assurance audits undertaken by managers and leaders, provide useful information about how well the service implements processes, systems and practices. The audits also inform the organisation about ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements.</p><p>Leaders have provided ongoing support and guidance to establish a sense of team. Collaborative ways of working are promoted and fostered with everyone involved in the service.</p><p>Barnardos KidStart has recently developed an internal evaluation framework. This should be useful to measure the effectiveness of practices and their impact on children's outcomes. A key next step is for leaders and teachers to build internal evaluation capability to evaluate the impact of strengthened systems and processes on children's learning. This should assist the service to embed internal evaluation and to measure their effectiveness.</p><p>Barnardos KidStart has a sound appraisal system in place to support visiting teachers. It has a specific focus on growth and development as well as personal and professional goals. The system includes the Practising Teacher Criteria. Using the Education Council's <em>Practising Teacher Criteria Self-Assessment Tool</em> should further strengthen this process and provide a clearer rationale about how each criteria is met.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for the Barnardos KidStart Service Manawatu East are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop a more responsive curriculum that supports infants' and toddlers' learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build educator capability to further develop assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen learning partnerships with parents and whānau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to support visiting teachers' and educators' capacity to promote educational success for Māori and Pacific children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support understanding and use of internal evaluation at visiting teacher and educator level to evaluate the impact of strengthened systems and processes on improving children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Barnardos KidStart Childcare Manawatu East Home-based Service completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Barnardos KidStart Childcare Manawatu East Home-based Service will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>28 November 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework Ngā Pou Here:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
