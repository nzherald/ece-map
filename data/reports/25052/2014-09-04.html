</table><p>With ongoing professional support from Kidicorp managers, the centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Pukekohe was purchased by Kidicorp Ltd in 2013. Prior to relicensing the two centres, Pukekohe Tahi and Rua, operated separately. The centre is licensed for 65 children with a maximum of 20 children under the age of two. There are currently 6 children less than two years of age enrolled.</p><p>The centre occupies two buildings, with children under three years of age in one building (Smallworld) and the older children in the other (Little Taniwha). Since Kidicorp purchased the centre there have been several staffing changes.</p><p>Kidicorp supports the centre with governance and management systems and support personnel. The organisation has established quality assurance and management systems, including governance policies, to guide the centre manager and head teacher in running the centre.</p><p>The centre’s roll growth is helped by a transport service provided by the centre. A van picks up children and drops them off at their homes. This service has helped make early childhood education available to more families.</p><p>Centre personnel are working under the guidance of Kidicorp managers to address self-identified areas for improvement, as well as those identified in the 2011 ERO report. Progress has been made in improving centre self-review practices and in planning educational programmes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Kidicorp managers and the centre director report that the centre is successfully building its capacity to provide more positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Children benefit from positive interactions with teachers and other children. Teachers work closely with children, engaging them in conversation and supporting their play. They ask older children questions that encourage them to think. These conversations promote oral language development and introduce new vocabulary.</p><p>Parents have good opportunities to communicate with teachers and to be informed about what is happening at the centre. Teachers make time available to talk with parents about their children. Parents of children who travel in the centre’s van are able to talk with the driver/teacher at drop-off and pick-up times.</p><p>Teachers work well as a team in Little Taniwha and Smallworld, and are committed to providing high quality education and care. Each team meets regularly to evaluate and plan the programme and to discuss centre operations. Centre leaders are considering how to strengthen the concept of ‘team’ across the centre as a whole.</p><p>The centre’s self review identified that managers and teachers wanted to improve partnerships with families and their planning, assessment and evaluation practices. They also wanted to strengthen centre leadership, teaching and self-review practices and to increase their confidence in using te reo Māori in the programme. Good progress made in the past year includes:</p><ul>
<li>programmes that are more responsive to children’s interests and strengths</li>
<li>better use of assessment information for planning learning opportunities</li>
<li>professional development to support the centre manager in her leadership role, and more shared leadership amongst the staff.</li>
</ul><p>Kidicorp provides ongoing, targeted professional development and support. Kidicorp health and safety policies and procedures are now well established and are effective in guiding teachers. The organisation’s quality assurance and professional support are also effective in helping staff identify areas to develop.</p><p>The Kidicorp professional support manager and business managers visit the centre regularly and give feedback on progress made towards the centre’s strategic goals. Kidicorp managers, the centre director and teachers are focused on improving the quality of education and care for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers and teachers are continuing to focus on appropriate self-identified areas for improvement, including:</p><ul>
<li>more challenging resources and activities for younger children</li>
<li>better information for parents about the value of play</li>
<li>regular programme evaluation, including provision for literacy, mathematics and te reo Māori.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Pukekohe completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Pukekohe will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>4 September 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
