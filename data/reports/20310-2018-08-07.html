</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Grange Early Learning Centre is a well-established centre in Sunnyvale, West Auckland. The centre is licensed for up to 37 children, with a maximum of eight under the age of two. Children who attend reflect the increasingly multicultural community.</p><p>The owner oversees centre operations, and is supported by an experienced centre manager who leads a team of registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is underpinned by the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The centre's core values include respect, whanaungatanga, diversity and learning through play. The philosophy statement also articulates a commitment to excellence, natural environments, and literacy and numeracy development.</p><p>ERO's 2014 report identified many positive practices. Since 2014, centre leaders have continued to strengthen their practices through systematic internal evaluation. Initiatives have been set in place that have helped children to understand the richness of New Zealand's bicultural heritage and strengthened relationships within the community.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are greeted warmly on their arrival in the calm, attractive and well-resourced centre. The nurturing environment and purposely positioned photos support connections with homes and families and promote a strong sense of belonging for children.</p><p>Infants enjoy a variety of activities and the opportunity to make their own choices in a play based programme. Warm interactions and reciprocal conversations with teachers and carers foster children's vocabulary. Adults' respectful care practices nurture toddlers' self-help skills and encourage independence. Wet weather clothing is available to allow children to participate in all aspects of the programme and have good access to outdoor activity.</p><p>Older children play well alongside each other. They are viewed as inquisitive and capable learners. Supportive adults listen to children's ideas and encourage them to try new ideas, problem solve and lead their own learning. Their interests are recognised and nurtured through good quality conversations. Extended periods of uninterrupted play promote opportunities for children to develop their own inquiries.</p><p>The indoor environment and multi-level landscaped outdoor space offer a compelling invitation for imaginative and creative play, as well as supporting appropriate risk taking and physical development. Teachers respond to children's learning strengths and interests by offering prompts to foster children's curiosity and encourage inquiry and investigation.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively, and they engage respectfully with children. Deliberate acts of teaching facilitate purposeful learning experiences that extend children's thinking and develop complexity in their play. Opportunities for literacy, numeracy and exploring the natural world are naturally woven into the programme. Digital devices are used purposefully for research.</p><p>The centre's strong commitment to a bicultural curriculum is apparent in the environment, and has resulted in rich, authentic learning experiences for whānau and staff. The inclusion of te reo and tikanga Māori is an integral part of centre practices that affirm Māori children’s cultural identity. Teachers are increasingly confident in their use of te reo Māori. It is timely to consider ways to make children's language, heritage and culture more evident in their portfolios.</p><p>Meaningful connections with the local community are expanding learning experiences for children. A focus on environmental sustainability is encouraging children to build their skills and knowledge, and to contribute to the local community gardens.</p><p>Parents are very positive about the education and care their children receive. Regular documentation, an online communication system and well-presented portfolios allow children's learning progress to be shared with families. Transitions into and through the centre are thoughtfully managed. Positive relationships with local schools have helped establish good processes around children's transition to school.</p><p>The centre manager's leadership has been integral to growing quality in the centre. Focused and purposeful internal evaluation has contributed to the very good quality teaching and learning practices. Teachers are encouraged and supported to be reflective practitioners. Robust induction and appraisal practices promote teacher inquiry, and establish expectations for high quality teaching. A mentor supports the team to critique practices and consider ways to enhance learning outcomes for children. Professional learning programmes extend teachers' practice and capability.</p><p>Effective governance systems guide centre operations. Management systems and expectations are clear and robust. The centre's culture of ongoing improvement, business sustainability and desire for high quality outcomes underpins all operations. Comprehensive policies are reviewed against practice. As part of the next review of the centre's philosophy, teachers could consider how it reflects the effective bicultural practice and ongoing focus for improvement evident in the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have comprehensive and relevant strategic plans that focus on using robust internal evaluation and teacher professional learning to build on current good practices across all aspects of centre operations.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Grange Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Grange Early Learning Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>7 August 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
