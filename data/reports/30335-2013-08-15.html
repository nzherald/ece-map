</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Country Kids Kindergarten opened in 2008 and is one of two kindergartens operating within the Te Aroha Kindergarten Association. It is situated in the grounds of Waitoa School, where children can enjoy the benefit of established shade trees in an attractive rural setting. Recent redevelopment of the building and grounds has enhanced children’s accessibility to the outdoor play area, which reflects an emphasis on sustaining the natural environment. Since the 2010 ERO review the kindergarten has increased its licence roll numbers. It now caters for 40 children who are all over two years old. Of the 62 children enrolled at the kindergarten, four identify as Māori. All teachers have relevant teaching qualifications.</p><p>The 2010 ERO report identified positive features, including responsive and nurturing interactions and the effective, inclusive leadership of the head teacher. The review found that there was a need to further develop a consistent approach to assessment, planning and evaluation. The experienced teaching team has responded positively to this aspect of the report.</p><p>The kindergarten’s philosophy focuses on child-initiated learning and sustaining positive relationships with children, staff and parents. These values and beliefs are clearly reflected in the programme teachers provide for children.</p><p>The Te Aroha Kindergarten Association provides policy direction and generous funding for staff professional development. It has also funded the recent building renovations. Budgeting and other financial matters are also effectively managed by the board in consultation with the head teacher. The association’s senior teacher has been appointed since the 2010 ERO review. There have been recent board elections, including a new chairperson.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers at Country Kids Kindergarten provide a high-quality programme for children. They skilfully encourage sustained play allowing children to explore and take safe risks. As a result, children are becoming competent and capable learners who willingly include others in their play. The programme is appropriately based on children’s interests and choices. Literacy and mathematics are integrated within indoor and outdoor play. Teachers continually model expected behaviours. They build on children’s experiences, encouraging them to solve problems and take responsibility for their learning. Children play happily, both independently and in groups, for long periods of time. There is a settled and purposeful tone throughout the kindergarten.</p><p>The attractive and stimulating environment is set up to challenge children’s thinking, and encourage their exploration of nature. The well-designed outdoor area provides many opportunities for social dramatic play and physical challenge. Teachers know children and their families well, and have established a family-friendly culture where parents and younger children can participate in programme activities. Tuakana/teina relationships are encouraged. Resources and equipment are easily accessed and include books and puzzles that reflect Māori language and culture.</p><p>There is an effective approach to managing the assessment of individual children’s learning and progress. This ensures that all children have regular entries in their portfolios and a scheduled evaluation by the teaching team with opportunities for guided input from parents. Children’s profiles show progression in their learning and development.</p><p>Shared leadership between the head teacher and staff is promoted and evident during the programme. The head teacher has maintained a collaborative approach to team work and the use of complementary strengths. There are frequent opportunities for professional discussion and reflection. The kindergarten’s self-review process is well developed and results in positive change with opportunities to monitor improvements. A culture of affirmation and constructive feedback among teachers ensures that children benefit from a consistently high-quality programme.</p><p>The board is in the process of developing a new strategic plan and has consulted kindergarten teachers about long-term goals. Trustees receive regular reports from the senior teacher.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Agreed next steps are to continue developing:</p><ul>
<li>processes for engaging parents’ written contribution to assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>the incidental integration of te reo Māori in kindergarten conversations</li>
<li>an appraisal process that effectively focuses on teachers’ personal development goals and positive outcomes for students.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>Because of recent changes within the governance structure of the association, ERO recommends that the Ministry of Education provides the board with advice and support in managing strategic planning, self review, and personnel matters, including appraisal.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Country Kids Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Country Kids Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>15 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
