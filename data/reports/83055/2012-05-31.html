<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>KidStart Gore provides individual care and education for children in educators' homes. It is part of the Barnardos KidStart organisation, operating under the Otago-Southland network. The service has undergone significant changes, including the appointment of a new team leader and business manager. The manager and team leader are currently reviewing the procedures and practices within the service.</p><p>A significant feature of the service is the nurturing and positive relationships evident among educators and children. Children show a strong sense of belonging in the homes of their educators. Educators provide children with a wide range of learning experiences in the home. Children&rsquo;s learning is further enhanced by purposeful outings into the community, such as playgroups, library and shopping.</p><p>The visiting teachers provide effective support for children&rsquo;s learning and care in educators&rsquo; homes. They have established positive working relationships with the educators, children and parents. The visiting teachers model effective practice and share ways of how to support children&rsquo;s learning. They have continued to develop and promote the use of curriculum kits to support children&rsquo;s learning across a range of areas.</p><p>Educators know their children well. They extend their learning by organising the play areas thoughtfully and offering appropriate resources. Educators listen carefully to children and follow their leads and interests. They actively encourage children to investigate and explore their surroundings.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s learning is attractively recorded in profile books. Educators skilfully record children&rsquo;s learning, possible next learning steps and what they will do to continue to develop children&rsquo;s interests and skills.</p><p>The next steps for managers are to clarify the visiting teacher&rsquo;s role for educators and parents, and continue to develop their understanding of, and practices for, self review.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><p><em>Relationships.</em> Children show a strong sense of belonging within their learning environments. ERO observed:</p><ul>
<li>a warm and nurturing atmosphere where children and their families are made to feel welcome</li>
<li>positive relationships between educators and children</li>
<li>the high expectations of educators for how children will relate to each other</li>
<li>children playing and learning well together in a highly supportive environment</li>
<li>educators working and communicating well with their visiting teachers.</li>
</ul><p><em>Focus on learning.</em> Children benefit from the value educators and visiting teachers place on learning. Educators effectively identify children&rsquo;s learning and extend children&rsquo;s thinking. The visiting teachers skilfully support educators in identifying appropriate strategies to support children&rsquo;s learning. This includes promoting the use of curriculum kits to support children&rsquo;s learning across a range of areas.</p><p><em>Learning experiences.</em> Children enjoy a range of learning experiences within and beyond the home. Educators generally follow children&rsquo;s interests and needs. The outdoor environments observed by ERO allow children to play outdoor games, develop their physical skills and explore different surroundings. Children have many opportunities to solve problems and have their thinking challenged.</p><p><em>Learning environments.</em> Children learn and play in appropriate play areas that sustain their attention. ERO noted:</p><ul>
<li>the range of interesting resources that are easily accessible to the children</li>
<li>children&rsquo;s work is valued and attractively displayed so that children can revisit previous learning</li>
<li>the opportunities for dramatic, creative and imaginative play</li>
<li>the affirming interactions between educators and children</li>
<li>children&lsquo;s high levels of confidence when asking educators for help and support.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>In discussions between the teaching staff and ERO, it was agreed that the following areas need review and development.</p><p><em>Visiting teachers&rsquo; role.</em> To help ensure a better understanding of the visiting teachers&rsquo; roles and responsibilities, the team leader needs to clarify the:</p><ul>
<li>purpose of the monthly visits to observe individual children</li>
<li>expectations of records of the monthly visits.</li>
</ul><p>There are useful guidelines outlining the visiting teachers&rsquo; role. It is now timely for these to be reviewed to evaluate the effectiveness of how well they are carried out and understood by the relevant people.<em>Self review.</em> The team leader and visiting teachers recognise the need to continue to develop their understanding of, and practices for, self review. Self review should include how effectively the service&rsquo;s philosophy is being implemented, including how well systems and curriculum guidelines are supporting the philosophy.</p><p>A better review process is likely to assist the service in identifying areas that are going well and areas that require improvement.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of KidStart Gore completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>31 May 2012</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>
