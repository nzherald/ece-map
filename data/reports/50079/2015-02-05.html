</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Peninsula Preschool is a small, flourishing, community-based centre operating under an incorporated society constitution. The centre caters for children aged from three to five years.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s philosophy aims for children to develop a strong sense of self, emotional security and to have relevant and meaningful learning experiences. Play and good teacher modelling are seen as key to building social and emotional skills.</p><p>A feature of this service is the strong level of support and collaboration between the teaching team and parent community. Teachers&rsquo; ongoing focus on helping families to engage in the life of the centre promotes useful partnerships.</p><p>An elected committee of parent members is responsible for the governance of the centre. This committee works in partnership with parents, teachers and the centre manager.</p><p>The centre manager, with the support of teachers and a part time administrator, is responsible for the daily running of the centre. It is staffed by qualified early childhood teachers. The teaching team has undertaken a wide range of professional development designed to improve teaching and the centre operations.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happily engaged in sustained, co-operative play and teachers&rsquo; interactions support them. Play is both teacher facilitated and child initiated. Children demonstrate a sense of belonging. They display respect for themselves, others and their surroundings.</p><p>Children are very well supported by teachers to become confident and competent learners. They are challenged to solve problems and encouraged to gain independence. Teachers know them well and support their education and care through friendly, respectful interactions.</p><p>The attractive outdoor area promotes children's exploration. It has been carefully constructed to recognise and encourage an understanding of, and respect for, the environment and for children&rsquo;s local and cultural heritage. Indoors, resources are easily accessible, attractively stored and offer opportunities to engage in imaginative, active and creative play.</p><p>The centre is welcoming of all children. The cultural backgrounds of children are known and their identities fostered. Families are welcomed and encouraged to share their culture with others. Children with special educational needs are well catered for and their learning needs discussed with all involved.</p><p>A strong focus on culturally appropriate practices is evident. Teachers seek ways to integrate tikanga M&#257;ori into the curriculum in authentic ways. Further development of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori is an identified centre priority.</p><p>Leaders and teachers work in close partnership with families based on teaching and learning. They are very respectful of families and value positive relationships. They know the aspirations parents hold for their children and plan accordingly. Parents are provided with regular, useful information on their children&rsquo;s progress and contribute to conversations about their child&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Assessment profiles are informative, attractive and available in hard copy and digitally. These include observations of children and their learning and records of enrichment events. Profiles provide parents with an ongoing record of the range of their child&rsquo;s experiences. Parents have multiple opportunities to discuss their children&rsquo;s learning with teachers.</p><p>Teachers make very good use of children&rsquo;s assessment information to understand and to effectively plan their learning pathways. Analysis of these assessments, session evaluations and the centre&rsquo;s focus on place and sustainability provide a strong basis for planning.</p><p>Opportunities to enrich the programme are captured and well used. Sustainability and a sense of place and belonging provide a foundation for a curriculum that is underpinned by the centre&rsquo;s philosophy. Parents have input into planning and make regular, valued contributions to the day&rsquo;s activities. Teachers make good use of the expertise of community members in the programme. Excursions provide another opportunity for enrichment of the curriculum.</p><p>Routines are responsive to children&rsquo;s needs and support their growing independence. They are based on children&rsquo;s&rsquo; preferences and support the development of cultural understandings.</p><p>Transition to school is carefully considered and well supported. Interaction with the adjoining school is regular. Links are made between the preschool&lsquo;s curriculum, <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, and the school curriculum. Integration of literacy and numeracy is carefully considered and there is good modelling of this through play. Science is also evident throughout the centre.</p><p>The manager provides strong leadership to the committee and staff, and guides centre development. Positive team culture is highly evident. Staff, parents and children work together collaboratively. A shared leadership model enables teachers&rsquo; individual skills and interests to be well used.</p><p>The service is well governed by a committee of parent representatives who provide oversight of the centre&rsquo;s operations. Members are organised, committed and bring a range of skills to their governance roles. Their support is improvement focused and impacts positively on centre operations.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s self review is improvement focused. Governors and teachers clearly understand the purpose of self review and its place in ensuring constant improvement. A robust process is used where current research about early childhood practices, and input from parents and children are all carefully considered. Focused improvements have a positive impact on children, parents, teachers and opportunities for learning.</p><p>Appraisal processes and practices are robust, useful and appreciated by staff for their support of ongoing growth as professionals. There is alignment between appraisal, professional practice and strategic intent.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Peninsula Community Preschool Inc. completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Peninsula Community Preschool Inc. will be in four years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>5 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
