</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Henderson Early Learning Centre opened in January 2012. The service is licensed for 30 children including 25 aged under two years. Children from six months to school age learn and play in a mixed-age group environment. The centre caters for an increasingly diverse community. At the time of this ERO review, 33 children were enrolled including eight children identified as Māori.</p><p>The centre is located on the grounds of Henderson High School and close to He Wero O Ngā Wahine: Teen Parent Unit (TPU). Centre staff provide care and education for babies and toddlers of teen parents attending He Wero who are continuing their education at the school. While the majority of children under two years are from TPU mothers, the centre also caters for children from the local community.</p><p>The centre operates under the Barnardos Kid Start organisation which provides governance and management support. Recent organisational changes, as well as centre staffing restructures have resulted in a new team of professionals. They are working collaboratively to establish shared understandings of high quality teaching and learning practices.</p><p>Most of the staff are qualified teachers. The centre manager is the head teacher and curriculum leader. Developing a collaborative and effective teaching team is a priority for development. This is the first ERO report for this centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Henderson Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children. A key feature of this centre is the value it places on whanaungatanga through building respectful and trusting relationships with all parents and whānau. Teachers are particularly focused on supporting the mothers from the TPU to achieve the best possible learning outcomes and care for their tamariki.</p><p>Children benefit from the centre’s focus on promoting a family-like atmosphere. Everybody is warmly welcomed and included in the centre’s programmes and celebrations. Flexible routines are responsive to children’s needs. Children have good access to the indoor and outdoor environments, and to resources in the variety of play areas. They choose their activities and play on their own, in pairs or in small groups.</p><p>Infants and toddlers play alongside older children in tuakana-teina relationships. The favourable teacher to child ratios promotes one-to-one interactions and conversations and a calm atmosphere. Group sizes are kept small. This enables infants and toddlers to settle and choose freely from the activities provided for them.</p><p>Teachers share responsibility for children’s care and wellbeing. Good progress is being made in developing teachers’ understanding of a curriculum that responds to children’s interests and strengths. Teachers share observations about children’s learning, interests and developmental stages.</p><p>Portfolios of children’s involvement in the programme show a growing partnership with parents. Wall displays clearly demonstrate positive adult-child relationships. They also provide parents with good information about children’s learning. Leaders are looking for ways to further include parent and child voice in the programme. Teachers are continuing to strengthen their planning, assessment and evaluation of children’s learning.</p><p>Parents appreciate teachers’ commitment to providing an inclusive environment through warm and caring relationships. They feel well included in centre activities and enjoy conversations with teachers about their children’s learning and development.</p><p>Leaders and teachers show a strong commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The most recent professional learning has been teacher involvement in Noho Marae. This learning is aimed at strengthening bicultural practices and learning outcomes for Māori and all children. Leaders are determined to build a strong foundation for, and sustainability in, te reo and tikanga Māori.</p><p>Centre management strengths include:</p><ul>
<li>good teaching practice modelled by the centre manager who is developing her leadership of the curriculum</li>
<li>a systematic approach to self review that incorporates parent and teacher perspectives</li>
<li>the alignment of policies, practices and relevant documentation to guide operations that impact positively on children and their wellbeing</li>
<li>strong support from the Barnardos KidStart organisation to closely monitor health and safety practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders have identified appropriate development priorities. These include:</p><ul>
<li>adding further complexity to children’s learning</li>
<li>developing the environment to invite children to investigate and participate in activities that promote, challenge and extend their thinking and physical skills</li>
<li>focusing self review on how teachers can enhance outcomes for children</li>
<li>increasing teachers’ understanding of second language learning through professional learning</li>
<li>developing a deeper understanding of effective mixed-age teaching and learning practices</li>
<li>investigating further ways to build parent understanding of effective early childhood education as the foundation for children’s future learning and success.</li>
</ul><p>ERO also discussed the importance of evaluating the overall quality of teaching and learning. This should include considering how well literacy, mathematics, science and technology learning are being developed.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Henderson Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they select ‘have’ or ‘have not’ taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, leaders and teachers should ensure:</p><ul>
<li>older children have unrestricted and well-monitored access to the toilet</li>
<li>ratios for supervision are clear on signed parent permission slips for excursions outside the centre.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Henderson Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>28 August 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
