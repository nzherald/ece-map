<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2>
<p>Gisborne Community Early Education Centre/Te Whare Tiaki Tamariki is located beside the river in the central business district of Gisborne. Children learn in an environment that enables them to make meaningful connections with their local community.</p>
<p>Staff continue to provide high quality education and care for infants, toddlers and young children. A strength of the centre is the building of authentic, reciprocal relationships with children, their families and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<p>Self review is well embedded in practice. Staff have reviewed the learning programmes for children and made some philosophical changes to their practices. In consultation with local iwi, new names for the two learning spaces, Te Tamaiti Whawha for children aged up to two and a half years and Te Tamaiti Rawekeweke for children aged over two and a half years, reflect the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p>
<p>Learning is fun for children as they engage independently and with others in meaningful play. The programme for Te Tamaiti Whawha focuses on developing trusting and reciprocal relationships amongst children, teachers, parents and wh&#257;nau. Te Tamaiti Rawekeweke teachers develop these skills and qualities further.</p>
<p>Staff know children and their families very well. Transitions into, within and beyond the centre are well managed and strongly focused on the child&rsquo;s readiness for each stage. Families and wh&#257;nau are respected by teachers as key contributors to their child&rsquo;s learning and development in their primary caregiver role. Staff support parents to share their knowledge and family context to ensure that the child&rsquo;s learning journey at the centre and home is connected.</p>
<p>An executive management committee governs the centre. The manager works closely with them and provides ongoing reports about centre programmes and activities.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Gisborne Community Early Education Centre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atGisborne Community Early Education Centre.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The teaching and learning environment at the centre is area specific. Teachers define and choose their own teaching strength and have autonomy in this area. Staff have reviewed the learning programmes for children and made some philosophical changes to their practices. In consultation with local iwi, new names for the two learning spaces, Te Tamaiti Whawha (children aged up to two and a half years) and Te Tamaiti Rawekeweke (children aged over two and a half years), reflect the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p>
<p>An executive management committee governs the centre. The manager works closely with them and provides ongoing reports about centre programmes and activities.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<h4>Programme</h4>
<p>The centre&rsquo;s curriculum is underpinned by Te Whaariki, the early childhood curriculum. Learning is fostered by knowledgeable adults who recognise children as confident and competent learners.</p>
<p>The programme for Te Tamaiti Whawha focuses on developing trusting and reciprocal relationships amongst children, teachers, parents and wh&#257;nau. This gives children a secure base for their learning and a positive sense of themselves. Te Tamaiti Rawekeweke teachers develop these skills and qualities further. Children are empowered to question, make connections, challenge and develop problem solving strategies.</p>
<p>Learning is fun for children as they engage independently and with others in meaningful play. Teachers notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s interests and record these as stories in portfolios.</p>
<p>Families and wh&#257;nau are respected by teachers as key contributors to their child&rsquo;s learning and development as primary caregivers. Staff support parents to share their knowledge and family context to ensure that each child&rsquo;s learning journey at the centre and home is connected.</p>
<p>Self review is well embedded in practice and effectively used to guide management and teaching and learning decisions. It is clearly focused on providing the best possible outcomes for children, family and wh&#257;nau. Teachers are a very reflective team who regularly share and discuss their professional learning and teaching practices.</p>
<h3>Interactions</h3>
<p>Children and adults&rsquo; interactions are affirming and caring. From a young age children are shown and taught respect through consistent interactions and caring routines modelled by teachers, parents and wh&#257;nau. Staff know children and their families very well. Transitions into, within and beyond the centre are well managed and strongly focused on the child&rsquo;s readiness for each stage.</p>
<h3>Learning environment</h3>
<p>Children learn in an environment that enables them to make meaningful connections with their local community.</p>
<p>The centre is located in the central city. However, children have regular access to the natural wildlife, local history and the diversity of the surrounding community. Children use a wide range of resources and equipment to support their learning. A significant number of these have been specially chosen to help children build self-assurance and independence. Displays include photographs, artwork and learning stories that capture children&rsquo;s interests. Literacy, numeracy and science are woven into learning. Children demonstrate confidence in their surroundings and with others.</p>
<h3>Future Priorities</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that management and staff will use their effective self review to identify priorities to continue to improve outcomes for children.</p>
<a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3>
<p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul><li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service;</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children;</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3>
<p>There are 24 children at the centre who identify as M&#257;ori. The centre is situated in a community where 47% of the local population identify as M&#257;ori. Management understand and embrace the importance of M&#257;ori having an authentic voice at a governance level. The appointment of a Kaiwhakahaere has been standard practice for 14 years. The position is nominated and voted upon solely by M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>Wh&#257;nau partnerships are integral to children&rsquo;s sense of belonging in the centre. These are evident in:</p>
<ul><li>tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori being a natural part of the curriculum and woven intricately in all aspects of the day</li>
<li>teacher professional development focused on supporting M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau</li>
<li>a Kaiwhakahaere who provides culturally appropriate direction for staff on M&#257;ori protocols</li>
<li>wh&#257;nau sharing their whakapapa through aural and visual stories</li>
<li>connections made in the programme with iwi and hapu history and legends related to the river that flows past the centre.</li>
</ul><p>Educators relate to M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau in consistent, constant and constructive ways.</p>
<p>Judgements made under the quality of education section of this report apply to wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</p>
<a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Gisborne Community Early Education Centre completed an ERO Centre Management Assurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>

<p>To the Parents and Community of Gisborne Community Early Education Centre</p>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Gisborne Community Early Education Centre.</p>
<p>Gisborne Community Early Education Centre/Te Whare Tiaki Tamariki is located beside the river in the central business district of Gisborne. Children learn in an environment that enables them to make meaningful connections with their local community.</p>
<p>Staff continue to provide high quality education and care for infants, toddlers and young children. A strength of the centre is the building of authentic, reciprocal relationships with children, their families and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<p>Self review is well embedded in practice. Staff have reviewed the learning programmes for children and made some philosophical changes to their practices. In consultation with local iwi, new names for the two learning spaces, Te Tamaiti Whawha for children aged up to two and a half years and Te Tamaiti Rawekeweke for children aged over two and a half years, reflect the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p>
<p>Learning is fun for children as they engage independently and with others in meaningful play. The programme for Te Tamaiti Whawha focuses on developing trusting and reciprocal relationships amongst children, teachers, parents and wh&#257;nau. Te Tamaiti Rawekeweke teachers develop these skills and qualities further.</p>
<p>Staff know children and their families very well. Transitions into, within and beyond the centre are well managed and strongly focused on the child&rsquo;s readiness for each stage. Families and wh&#257;nau are respected by teachers as key contributors to their child&rsquo;s learning and development in their primary caregiver role. Staff support parents to share their knowledge and family context to ensure that the child&rsquo;s learning journey at the centre and home is connected.</p>
<p>An executive management committee governs the centre. The manager works closely with them and provides ongoing reports about centre programmes and activities.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p>
<p>National Evaluation Topics &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p>
<p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
