</table><p>Massey Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Massey Playcentre operates as a parent cooperative and is licensed for 30 children, including 15 under the age of two years.</p><p>Programmes for children are underpinned by the Playcentre philosophy of parents and children playing and learning together. Massey Playcentre members recognise parents as first educators of their children. They aim to support each other to provide the best environment for children to learn and grow, and to build relationships within the community.</p><p>The centre is part of the newly established Northern North Island Playcentre Region. Regional systems support centre members to manage their centres and to provide educational programmes for their children. Playcentre personnel also provide adult education programmes for parents/whānau to achieve Playcentre qualifications.</p><p>ERO's 2015 report identified a number of areas for development including bicultural practices, integrating science into the programme, strengthening relationships with local schools and completing the outdoor environment. Centre members have responded positively and worked well towards strengthening these aspects of practice.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 12 reviews in the Northern North Island Playcentre region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children lead the programme. They benefit from the provision of a rich learning environment which is spacious and well resourced, both indoors and outdoors. Easy access to resources allows children to explore new activities and experiences, and rediscover old favourites. Children are settled and engaged.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well integrated into the daily programme. Play areas have been thoughtfully arranged with these young children in mind. All children benefit from the mixed-age setting and the opportunities for tuakana/teina relationships.</p><p>The Playcentre philosophy is well enacted. Parents are positive, supportive and responsive to children's ideas and requests. They enable children to sustain their play through the provision of resources and conversations that support play-based learning. Children have a good sense of belonging in the Playcentre environment.</p><p>Parents provide good opportunities for children to learn about the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa. Centre leaders model the use of te reo Māori in conversations with children and other adults. Some families who have English as an additional language, use their home languages during session times, maintaining and supporting children's sense of cultural identity.</p><p>Children's portfolios are good records of their participation in centre sessions and excursions. Learning stories capture their interests and strengths clearly and well. Links to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, have become more evident over time. Science is now well integrated throughout the programme.</p><p>Parents work collaboratively. They provide good role models for children's developing oral language and social competence. There is good commitment to ongoing adult education. A distributed leadership model involves centre members taking on different roles and responsibilities, ensuring the centre's sustainability.</p><p>Well aligned strategic and annual plans are guiding the centre's future direction. The purpose of internal evaluation is well understood by centre members. A robust process guides the review of relevant areas of practice and promotes positive outcomes for children.</p><p>A regional structure is replacing individual Playcentre Associations. Newly appointed regional personnel are making good progress in building on existing systems, and establishing effective regional management structures for supporting centres. Centre support workers are guided by regional support coordinators. Systems are being developed for monitoring the quality of programmes for children, adult education levels, and health and safety requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps for centre improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>making the centre philosophy more specific to the centre's unique context and more aligned with the aims of current centre members</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop programme planning processes that promote children's more complex thinking and learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The Northern North Island Playcentre regional manager (acting) and support personnel agree that key next steps for the region include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implementing and embedding the revised Playcentre adult education programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing a framework to evaluate the effectiveness of centre support systems, roles and processes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Massey Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Massey Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>31 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
