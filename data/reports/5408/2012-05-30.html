<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Westport Kindergarten operates under the constitution of the Westport Kindergarten Association. It is the only kindergarten in the local community. The governing board is responsible for long-term planning to guide the day-to-day management of the kindergarten. Aspects of the kindergarten&rsquo;s operation are managed by the Nelson District Free Kindergarten Association.</p><p>The kindergarten currently operates half day sessions for up to 46 children over the age of two years old. All teachers are qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>Positive features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>the emphasis teachers place on developing meaningful relationships with children and their families/wh&#257;nau, and between children</li>
<li>the effective ways that teachers extend children&rsquo;s thinking and problem-solving skills, and support their communication and oral language development</li>
<li>an interesting and varied programme that helps children develop confidence, become more independent, and learn about aspects of the local community.</li>
</ul><p>Since the August 2008 ERO review, teachers have made significant progress in providing increased opportunities for children to hear and use te reo M&#257;ori and develop their understandings of aspects of M&#257;ori culture.</p><p>The teachers work as a reflective team, making good use of opportunities to discuss children&rsquo;s learning and progress, and aspects of the programme. They have reliably identified that their next steps are to strengthen self review, and aspects of assessment and planning practices.</p><p>The kindergarten is well organised and managed. It operates under a useful set of policies and procedures for monitoring health and safety.</p><p>The kindergarten board functions well. It is focused on improving children&rsquo;s access to high-quality early childhood education across the region. As a result, trustees are undertaking several projects to establish new early childhood facilities. The board acknowledges that as it expands its responsibilities, it will be important to ensure that effective board self-review systems are well established.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Westport Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atWestport Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy is based on developing meaningful relationships with children, their families and the community. Teachers aim to provide a child-driven programme that emphasises children as active participants in their own learning.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Effective relationships are a key feature of the kindergarten. Teachers place particular emphasis on supporting positive relationships through the curriculum. ERO observed:</p><ul>
<li>warm and affirming relationships between children and their teachers</li>
<li>welcoming and supportive interactions between teachers and parents</li>
<li>teachers sharing useful information about children and working in collaborative ways</li>
<li>children playing cooperatively for sustained period of time.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers relate to children in effective ways to extend their learning and thinking. They involve themselves regularly in children&rsquo;s play and encourage them to talk about their ideas. They ask relevant questions to help children extend their thinking and problem-solving skills. Teachers know children well and refer to their families and home lives when they talk with children. This provides ongoing opportunities to develop children&rsquo;s oral language and communication skills.</p><p>Children benefit from an interesting and varied programme that is responsive to their interests.</p><p>They have good opportunities to:</p><ul>
<li>initiate and follow their own play interests and develop independence skills</li>
<li>explore a wide range of equipment and resources</li>
<li>learn about the local community, its people and facilities.</li>
</ul><p>ERO observed children who confidently used all areas of the programme and who were well engaged in their play and learning.</p><p>Teachers have made significant progress since the 2008 ERO review in providing increased opportunities for children to hear and use te reo M&#257;ori and develop their understandings of aspects of M&#257;ori culture. Teachers include bicultural practices regularly in the programme and daily routines.</p><p>The teachers are a well led and reflective team. They engage in ongoing professional development. They regularly discuss children&rsquo;s learning and progress. Teachers make good use of their individual strengths to support each other and extend children&rsquo;s experiences. Teachers value the significant support from the board that allows them to develop their professional and personal skills, and be actively involved in community work.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s well-being and learning is being supported by the strong links between the kindergarten and local community. Board and staff maintain effective networks and relationships within the community that help to provide extra resources and expertise to support the kindergarten&rsquo;s ongoing development. This includes well-established relationships with local primary schools.</p><p>The board is focused on improving children&rsquo;s access to high-quality early childhood education in the region. Board members have a well-informed understanding of their governance roles. They are responsive to the changing needs of the community and have undertaken several projects to establish new early childhood facilities in the local district. The board has appropriately focused on:</p><ul>
<li>using well-targeted management and advisory support</li>
<li>ensuring the ongoing renovation and maintenance of facilities, such as extensive playground development</li>
<li>prioritising professional development and training for the board and all staff.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The board, managers and teachers have reliably identified many of the next steps to improve outcomes for children. These include strengthening self review and assessment practices.</p><p>Teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that they are in the early stages of using a more formal, in-depth self-review process to evaluate aspects of their programme and practices. This should provide clearer documentation of their self-review processes.</p><p>The board trustees have also acknowledged that they are in the early stages of trialling new self-review systems to review their effectiveness. The development of these systems will provide clearer documentation of their self review.</p><p>Teachers are appropriately focused on improving assessment and programme planning practices.</p><p>This includes consistency in how well teachers:</p><ul>
<li>write learning stories</li>
<li>include the views of children and their families in learning records</li>
<li>record children&rsquo;s progress in learning.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers should more clearly evaluate their planning to determine the effectiveness of the strategies they are using to extend children&rsquo;s interests. This could also include reviewing how well they use information and communication technologies (ICT) to support children&rsquo;s learning.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Westport Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children.

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-westport-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Westport Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Westport Kindergarten.</p><p>Westport Kindergarten operates under the constitution of the Westport Kindergarten Association. It is the only kindergarten in the local community. The governing board is responsible for long-term planning to guide the day-to-day management of the kindergarten. Aspects of the kindergarten&rsquo;s operation are managed by the Nelson District Free Kindergarten Association.</p><p>The kindergarten currently operates half day sessions for up to 46 children over the age of two years old. All teachers are qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>Positive features of this kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>the emphasis teachers place on developing meaningful relationships with children and their families/wh&#257;nau, and between children</li>
<li>the effective ways that teachers extend children&rsquo;s thinking and problem-solving skills, and support their communication and oral language development</li>
<li>an interesting and varied programme that helps children develop confidence, become more independent, and learn about aspects of the local community.</li>
</ul><p>Since the August 2008 ERO review, teachers have made significant progress in providing increased opportunities for children to hear and use te reo M&#257;ori and develop their understandings of aspects of M&#257;ori culture.</p><p>The teachers work as a reflective team, making good use of opportunities to discuss children&rsquo;s learning and progress, and aspects of the programme. They have reliably identified that their next steps are to strengthen self review, and aspects of assessment and planning practices.</p><p>The kindergarten is well organised and managed. It operates under a useful set of policies and procedures for monitoring health and safety.</p><p>The kindergarten board functions well. It is focused on improving children&rsquo;s access to high-quality early childhood education across the region. As a result, trustees are undertaking several projects to establish new early childhood facilities. The board acknowledges that as it expands its responsibilities, it will be important to ensure that effective board self-review systems are well established.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
