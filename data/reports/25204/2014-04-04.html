</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Manukau Peninsula Playcentre provides for up to thirty children and their families in Matakawau, on the Awhitu Peninsula. The centre is cooperatively managed by centre members who implement programmes for children. The centre offers three general sessions each week, when children attend with their parents. The Playcentre philosophy of whānau and children learning together underpins centre operations.</p><p>Manukau Peninsula Playcentre is one of seventeen centres in the Counties Playcentre Association, which provides a management and policy framework for centre operations. Liaison workers and other elected Association officers provide support for centres. Association members deliver the Playcentre adult education programme to help whānau build their understanding about children’s learning.</p><p>Manukau Peninsula Playcentre is a small rural centre with established strong links and relationships with the community. The philosophy of providing an empowering and stimulating environment in which adults and children are able to develop new skills for a lifetime of learning guides centre practice. Centre members place the child at the heart of centre practices.</p><p>The 2010 ERO report stated that "children have many opportunities for uninterrupted play and that they confidently initiate play ideas". These affirming practices continue to be evident. Since ERO’s 2010 review, health and safety practices have been improved.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four playcentre reviews in the Counties Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Adults provide a welcoming and inclusive centre atmosphere that helps children to interact positively with each other. Centre members show genuine respect, appreciation and support for one another. High levels of trust are evident among adults and children.</p><p>Children know each other and adults well. They benefit from positive relationships with adults and are encouraged to develop social and leadership skills. Caring and respectful interactions enable infants and toddlers to learn alongside older children. This supportive environment contributes to children’s independence and promotes a strong sense of manaakitanga in the centre.</p><p>Children choose from a variety of play spaces and enjoy the large outdoor area, which provides many opportunities for exploration and physical challenge. Centre members could consider including signs, symbols and letters to enhance children’s literacy and numeracy experiences outdoors. Adults skilfully allow children time and space to develop their play. They engage in conversations with children to help them make sense of their learning. Good practices support children to make smooth transitions into the centre and on to school. Strong relationships with the neighbouring school provide children with valuable learning experiences that give them the confidence to succeed when they leave the centre.</p><p>Bicultural awareness and practices are reflected in the programme and the learning environment. Centre members’ bicultural commitment and their acknowledgment of te ao Māori help build both adults’ and children’s confidence and familiarity with te reo and tikanga Māori. This commitment should now be reflected in the centre’s philosophy statement.</p><p>Centre members are developing systems for self review, which they have identified as an area for continued improvement. Informal self review is ongoing and informs programme planning. Adults evaluate sessions daily and use this information to extend children’s interests. Portfolios celebrate children’s learning and are available for adults and children to revisit past experiences. The centre’s philosophy guides its newly developed strategic and annual plans.</p><p>Association management practices are well established. Self review involves centre members and contributes to decision making. A strategic review is currently underway, with a view to streamlining association systems and practices and making them more manageable for centre members. This review could also consider how liaison workers could help centres to establish effective strategic and annual planning, and strengthen their self-review practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members and ERO agree that next steps for Manukau Peninsula Playcentre include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to improve strategic and annual planning, and self-review processes, to support ongoing centre growth and development</li>
<li>better targeting ongoing professional development and adult training levels to support strategic and annual plans</li>
<li>continuing to develop adults’ skills in supporting children to become critical thinkers by engaging them in more in-depth conversations</li>
<li>reviewing planning and assessment practices to ensure they are documented in meaningful ways.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Manukau Peninsula Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Manukau Peninsula Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>4 April 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
