</table><p>Little Feet Childcare Centre Limited is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Feet Childcare Centre in Papatoetoe, provides education and care for children up to school age. It is licensed for 48 children and has separate interior learning areas for children under and over two years of age. The majority of the children are Indian. Teachers reflect the ethnically diverse community they serve.</p><p>The service is one of three centres owned by the two directors, who oversee the operational and administrative aspects of all the centres. The directors are supported by the centre supervisor, who manages the day-to-day operations and guides staff in providing learning programmes for children. Three of the staff are registered teachers.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is based on children learning through play. Children are viewed as competent, capable learners. Warmth, trust and aroha are woven into the philosophy, which guides curriculum implementation. The programme is guided by <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Positive aspects noted in the 2016 ERO report have been maintained. These include the welcoming atmosphere and children's strong sense of belonging. The centre has experienced a high level of staff turnover in the past three years, including changes of centre leaders.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident, eagerly engage in play and enjoy the company of their teachers and peers. They have fun and show care and concern for others. They know teachers' expectations and have good opportunities to make choices about their play. Children are enthusiastic to learn and are developing a positive attitude to learning.</p><p>Culturally responsive teaching practices affirm children's backgrounds and build on their strengths. Teachers provide a language rich environment in which children’s conversation is enhanced and homes language are spoken. Infants and toddlers benefit from nurturing, individualised care.</p><p>Responsive and caring relationships contribute positively to children’s emotional wellbeing and sense of belonging. Parent involvement is welcomed and there is an active parent committee. Teachers work together collaboratively. Children’s transitions into the centre and to school are responsive to individual child and whānau needs.</p><p>Children learn in an inviting, attractive environment that acknowledges their cultural backgrounds and supports sustained play and exploration. Children’s creative expression through imaginative play and music is valued and supported. They have good opportunities to include literacy, mathematics and natural science as part of their play. The outside area is well equipped and offers a variety of physically challenging activities. Teachers could increase children's access to the outside area and evaluate how effectively it is used to promote learning.</p><p>Teachers are developing a collective understanding of assessment, planning and evaluation that is responsive to children’s dispositions and interests, and informs planning. Parents/whānau are provided with good information about the programme and encouraged to contribute their ideas and aspirations for their children. Centre leaders are aware that this is an area to strengthen further.</p><p>A sound organisational structure helps to maintain good practices and guide improvements. Policies and procedures are regularly reviewed and updated. The centre's philosophy is well understood, provides a good sense of direction and is evident in daily practice.</p><p>Centre leaders acknowledge the importance of building leadership capability. They are supportive and encouraging of staff and have sound human resource management systems. Leaders and teachers use internal evaluation to reflect on and identify ways to improve their practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps for teachers include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing a shared understanding about assessment, planning and evaluation that includes teaching strategies for responding to and increasing the depth and complexity of child-led learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building on their professional knowledge about quality education and care for infants and toddlers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening bicultural practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Next steps for centre leaders include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increasing their knowledge about working with Pacific children and their families by exploring the <em>Tapasā</em> resource</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a more collaborative and evaluative process of internal evaluation that focuses on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen staff appraisal processes by including more evidence of teacher inquiry, targeted observations and teachers' evaluation of their practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Feet Childcare Centre Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice, the service provider should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>provide greater detail in the report to parents and the local community about how targeted Equity Funding has been spent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that all items intended for children to sleep on are covered with or made from non-porous material.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>19 July 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken"> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
