</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sunnynook Kindergarten, in Auckland, previously operated under the name of Broadlands Kindergarten. The kindergarten provides early education and care for up to 40 children from two to five years of age. In term one 2014, the kindergarten changed to the Kindergarten Day Model. This model allows families to have the option of enrolling their children for either six hour days or for four hour morning sessions.</p><p>The kindergarten is committed to its philosophy of providing a challenging environment where children become problem-solvers and develop good social competencies and self esteem. The curriculum is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Children’s emerging interests are supported by teachers.</p><p>The 2010 ERO report suggested several strategies to improve learning outcomes for children. This included improving self review, strengthening te reo and tikanga Māori in the programme, and providing more complex learning opportunities for children. The report also suggested that teachers continue to develop more formal planning and evaluation processes. The kindergarten has responded well in most of these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are friendly and caring toward one another. Tuakana/teina relationships are evident where older children are mindful of the needs of younger children. Children display a good sense of belonging and are respectful of their peers and adults in the learning environment. Children are focused, independent learners. Many enjoy playing in inclusive groups that bring together girls and boys, and children from diverse ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>Teachers provide a good variety of learning opportunities for children. The learning environment is well organised and children choose from a selection of equipment in accordance with their interests. Some te reo and tikanga practices are evident in the programme, and aspects of children’s learning about Te Ao Māori, the Māori world, are displayed. Teachers have been researching ways to enrich their use of te reo and bicultural practices in the kindergarten.</p><p>Professional development has helped teachers to focus more effectively on planning for the learning of individuals as well as groups of children. Parents contribute their ideas to planning. Children’s learning dispositions, such as resilience, are fostered as important attitudes that strengthen their learning abilities. Children with special learning needs are well supported. They benefit from individual learning plans that are developed by teachers and parents in collaboration with specialist services.</p><p>The teaching team works together well. The head teacher has supported teachers’ development over time. She encourages them to take responsibility and lead in areas that are of interest to them. This leadership approach encourages teachers to research topics, or attend relevant training courses, to further increase their professional knowledge and skills. The teaching team encourage one another’s growth and share new learning with each other.</p><p>The Auckland Kindergarten Association has well established systems for self review and accountability to guide kindergarten management, and it continues to provide effective governance for kindergartens. The AKA has a strong commitment to biculturalism and to implementing strategies that support kindergartens in promoting positive outcomes for all children. Kindergartens have clear strategic goals, which closely link to those of the Association. This framework guides the vision for the kindergarten and its annual planning and is reflected in teachers' appraisal goals. The Association is currently reviewing the appraisal process for all kindergartens.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers, the Professional Services Manager and ERO agree that the key next steps for the kindergarten include:</p><ul>
<li>evaluating the effectiveness of annual and strategic planning</li>
<li>formalising approaches for developing and implementing a bicultural curriculum</li>
<li>further building teachers’ professional capacity and leadership skills</li>
<li>strengthening learning partnerships with parents through shared access to kindergarten computer programmes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sunnynook Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Sunnynook Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>12 September 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
