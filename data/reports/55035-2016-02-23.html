</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>First Years Preschool is a community-based centre in Dannevirke. It provides education and care for 56 children up to five years of age, including a maximum of 18 up to two years.</p><p>The centre is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. A commitment to providing high quality, community-based education and care for children, their families and whānau remains central to the centre's philosophy.</p><p>Since the May 2013 ERO report, a new head teacher has been appointed in the area for children over two years. There has also been ongoing upgrading of facilities and resources and an increase in licensed child spaces. Members of the community often contribute to the outdoor environment.</p><p>The centre continues to value the employment of qualified staff. More teachers have qualified since the previous ERO review and some have upgraded their teaching qualifications.</p><p>A parent committee is responsible for the governance of the preschool. They provide regular support for staff professional learning and development.</p><p>This report shows that the centre has sustained its positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn in an environment that is highly effective in supporting them to become 'confident and competent learners'. Teachers have positive and responsive relationships with children. They empower children to make choices, problem solve and learn independently. Children lead their learning and sustain interests for significant periods of time. Teachers are very skilful at extending children's interests and supporting them to build on their previous learning. Children and teachers learn together.</p><p>Children, their families and whānau and teachers contribute to each child's learning pathway. Planning and assessment are done collaboratively by teaching teams. They draw on children's interests, previous learning, skills and family and whānau experiences. Parents are key contributors to the planning wall and learning stories.</p><p>The programme is underpinned by a living curriculum that regularly changes and connects children's learning over time, as their interests and experiences evolve. Bicultural practices are strongly evident and draw on the knowledge and experiences of whānau, children and teachers. Teachers have researched approaches to promote te ao Māori to ensure the needs and aspirations of Māori children and their whānau are met.</p><p>Teachers seek ways to maintain children's connections with their cultures, languages and identities. ERO and leaders agree that teachers need to continue to strengthen this approach for all Pacific children.</p><p>The curriculum for up to two year olds, is underpinned by a strong philosophy of responsive caregiving that is highly effective in supporting infants' and toddlers' need for secure attachments. Teachers value the importance of home and centre routines and recognise that consistency is important in establishing a secure foundation for young children's care and education.</p><p>Transitions are very child centred to ensure children retain a strong sense of identity and belonging before, during and after the process. Successful transitions are supported by effective partnerships between families, whānau, teachers and schools. When children with additional needs attend the centre, they receive targeted and responsive support, based on their individual needs, from teachers and agencies.</p><p>Teachers have a team approach to the provision of high quality education and care for all children. They use research to keep themselves abreast of current early childhood initiatives and teaching practices. Teachers regularly investigate the effectiveness of their teaching on children's outcomes and learning relationships with parents. This practice is linked to the centre's strategic priorities, appraisal and philosophy.</p><p>Appraisal has an appropriate focus on developing teachers' practices. Professional learning is discussed and observed in teams to ensure teachers focus on improving outcomes for children. Recording some of these observations in a more formal way should provide additional evidence in teachers' appraisal files.</p><p>Self review is a well-established and understood practice. Leaders and teachers know its value in improving outcomes for children. The centre's philosophy guides all practices across the centre and promotes desired outcomes for children.</p><p>Leaders are highly effective in building capability within the centre to promote and enable positive outcomes for children and their families. They support teachers to develop and improve their practice in an inclusive and collaborative way. Teachers have opportunities to lead initiatives.</p><p>The centre manager works closely with the parent committee to ensure there is consistency of practices and expectations across the centre. She supports the two head teachers in their leadership role and is clearly focused on continuous improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre has the capacity and capability to sustain high quality education and care for children and to determine its own next steps.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of First Years Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of First Years Preschool will be in four years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>23 February 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
