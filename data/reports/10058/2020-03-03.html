</table><p>Next Generation Infant Care is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Next Generation Infant Care is licensed to provide full-day education and care for up to 20 children aged under two years. Children access two indoor learning spaces, including a quieter play area for very young children. The centre serves a culturally diverse community.</p><p>The centre is one of four under the ownership of Next Generation Childcare Company Limited. An experienced management team, including a director of the company, oversee the day-to-day running of the centre. They lead a team of three qualified teachers and one teacher in training.</p><p>The teaching philosophy focuses on the provision of an empowering environment respectful of the aspirations and values of whānau. Teachers aim to support children to become critical thinkers, to value their own and other cultures, and to have control over their learning. Establishing a sense of community with whānau, children and teachers is a central focus of the team.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report noted many aspects of quality teaching and learning practices that have been sustained. Areas for development included communication with families, bicultural practice and access to ongoing professional learning and development. There has been very good progress in these areas.</p><p>The centre is a member of the Te Ara Whetu Kāhui Ako | Community of Learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy is evident in the programme and teaching practices. Children confidently explore their environment and easily access resources that engage them in play and learning. They play alongside each other and respond with kindness to those around them. Children are relaxed and settled.</p><p>Children benefit from having consistency in teaching teams and teachers who provide nurturing, individualised care. Teachers know and understand the communication styles of individual children and skilfully use language to engage them in play and to model interactions with others. Children have developed secure attachments to their caregivers.</p><p>Teachers provide a calm, uncluttered environment and actively support children to explore indoors and outdoors. The spacious, natural outdoor play space provides a good range of physical challenges. Teachers support children's choices, include children in decisions that affect them and work well as a team. Children confidently investigate their surroundings, following their interests and curiosities.</p><p>Teachers and leaders have implemented numerous communication strategies with families. Time is allocated to welcome new families into the centre through meetings with a leader or teacher. Parents contribute to a blog where they can provide feedback regarding the programme and discuss their children's learning. Teachers gather whānau aspirations and reference these in learning stories supporting learning-based partnerships.</p><p>Leaders identify bicultural practice as a significant area of growth in this centre over the past 12 months. Effective professional learning and ongoing internal evaluation is supporting deeper knowledge and understandings of te reo Māori and Māori values and concepts. Teachers use te reo in their interactions with children and in learning stories. Increasing the visibility of te ao Māori in centre practices and documentation is an ongoing goal.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are continuing to develop and refine a new process of programme planning. As a result of professional learning, new templates have been introduced to simplify the process and to ensure a meaningful programme is planned for each child within the group setting. Teachers record children's learning through well-written learning stories. Portfolios show continuity and developing complexity of children's learning.</p><p>Service leaders have established a culture of continuous improvement. They have implemented a robust process for internal evaluation and successfully engage the whole team in focused professional learning opportunities. This ensures shared understandings across the team and supports the successful implementation of new initiatives that lead to positive outcomes for children. The leadership structure supports all teachers to lead in their area of strength. The service is well managed and led.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To enhance their current high-quality provision for children, centre leaders agree that their key next steps include rationalising and clarifying the centre's strategic goals to establish a clear direction for the future.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Next Generation Infant Care completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>3 March 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
