</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiwi Educare Ltd is a privately owned early childhood centre located in an eastern suburb of Rotorua city. The centre provides full-day education and care for children from birth to school age in a mixed-age setting. It is licensed for 36 children, including 10 up to the age of two years. The centre’s roll of 35, include 19 children of Māori descent.</p><p>The centre’s recently reviewed philosophy makes a commitment to working in partnership with whānau to provide a loving and caring environment. Priority is placed on promoting strong tuakana/teina relationships among children.</p><p>Kiwi Educare Ltd has a positive ERO reporting history. Since the previous ERO review in March 2013 ownership of the centre has changed. The new owner is a long-serving teacher at the centre and has assumed the role of centre manager and curriculum leader. Under her leadership significant developments in the programme and teaching practice have been implemented in response to ERO’s 2010 and 2013 reports. There have been some changes to the teaching team.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A special feature of Kiwi Educare is the mixed-age setting that fosters children’s wellbeing and sense of belonging. Tuakana/teina relationships, where older children support and nurture their younger peers and siblings, are highly evident in this whānau setting. Children also benefit from skilled teaching that promotes social skills, awareness of others, empathy, and compassion.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to explore and make links within the wider community. Recent changes to programme routines provide increased opportunities for children to engage in sustained play.</p><p>Teachers actively involve themselves alongside children in meaningful play. They effectively integrate aspects of literacy and mathematics naturally in the contexts of children’s interests and play. Some teachers are particularly effective at implementing strategies that support the development of children’s thinking and problem solving skills.</p><p>Māori children’s sense of language, culture and identity is promoted through the frequent use of waiata, karakia and teachers increasing use of te reo Māori in their daily interactions with children. Teachers consciously model and promote appropriate aspects of tikanga Māori practices. The centre manager acknowledges the importance of establishing relationships with kaumātua and local iwi.</p><p>The introduction of on-line assessment portfolios provide increased information to parents and whānau about their children’s learning and involvement in the programme. These also support parents and whānau to contribute their ideas and perspectives about their children’s learning. Teachers’ recent involvement in professional development is assisting them to implement useful assessment and planning processes. It is important to continue to develop these practices. Consideration should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening the continuity of learning for individual children</li>
<li>reflecting and responding to children’s language, culture and identity in assessment and planning</li>
<li>evaluating the effectiveness of teaching practices and programmes in responding to children’s interests and learning.</li>
</ul><p>The centre manager is a knowledgeable and experienced early childhood teacher. She is well respected and valued by the teaching team who benefit from her modelling of effective teaching and learning strategies. The centre manager is committed to providing the best possible educational outcomes for children and their families. She uses Ministry of Education equity funding to support increased participation for children. The centre manager is developing useful policies and procedures to guide centre operations.</p><p>Babies, toddlers and young children benefit from a strong culture of care that is underpinned by positive and respectful relationships at all levels of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the centre are to access ongoing support and guidance for the centre manager to support her to:</p><ul>
<li>develop and implement a robust teacher appraisal process</li>
<li>strengthen centre self-review and strategic planning practices</li>
<li>manage the complexities of her role and responsibilities.</li>
</ul><p>Priority should also be given to further reviewing and developing the learning environment, with particular consideration to:</p><ul>
<li>children’s ready access to a wide range of high-quality resources and equipment</li>
<li>strengthening opportunities for exploration, inquiry and physical challenge</li>
<li>celebrating children’s language, culture, identity, learning and creativity.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiwi Educare Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice teachers should fully implement the centre’s processes for checking the equipment, premises and facilities on a daily basis to ensure that they are safe for children’s use.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kiwi Educare Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>4 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
