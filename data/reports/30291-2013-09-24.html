</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Impressions Childcare Centre is a privately owned all-day childcare centre in the country town of Pirongia. It caters for children from six months to school age. The centre is organised in three distinct age-related areas, for children under two year olds, over two years old and a preschool section. In 2011 two original centres on the same site were amalgamated, and the combined centre was licensed for 110 children, including up to 20 children under two years of age. The current roll is 140 children, of whom 14 are identified as Māori. The centre leaders have maintained a maximum attendance of approximately 80 children at any one time.</p><p>The centre philosophy aims to provide a safe and welcoming environment that encourages children to engage and explore. The programme is developmentally appropriate and based on the principles of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki</em>. The Treaty of Waitangi is acknowledged and incorporated.</p><p>The owner and current manager have developed the centre from its beginnings in 2006. They are both on-site full time and available to support parents, staff and the children. The owner is responsible for personnel management, while the centre manager is responsible for all daily operations and the programme provided for children. Open communication with parents/whānau is promoted, and families are respected and encouraged to be involved. The centre maintains over 80% qualified staff. The previous ERO report recommended review of aspects of the programme related to routines, opportunities for complex play and enhancing the Māori dimension. While professional development and self-review have been undertaken, centre leaders recognise that further development in these areas is appropriate and timely.</p><p>A high proportion of the families associated with the centre come from the local rural community. Children’s experiences are extended and enriched through the close networks and relationships among the parent and local community. Most children move on to the nearby primary school.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are highly involved in a broad range of activities and experiences that promote their learning and development. Relationships among children and teachers are warm, mutually respectful and inclusive. Children’s physical and emotional needs are promptly and efficiently responded to by the staff through familiar and efficient routines.</p><p>Teachers have regular team meetings to share information about children’s current interests and strengths. They make use of additional input and feedback from parents to complete individual programme plans for each child. These plans are followed-up with relevant teacher observations and assessments that identify children’s learning and progress. Each child who attends the centre for 18 hours a week, or more, receives a well-presented portfolio that documents their involvement, learning and development through rich teacher narratives and captioned photographs. Teachers in the under-two area are currently trialling the development of e-portfolios for electronic recording of assessments to promote the sharing of children’s learning experiences with families.</p><p>Children’s early literacy and mathematics skills are fostered through the richness of the centre programmes. High levels of oral language are evident, and children have ready access to art and writing materials, books, puzzles and manipulative equipment. The attractive and well-resourced environments encourage children’s free choice of creative and imaginative play. There are appropriate opportunities in the outside play areas for physical challenge, exploration and natural world experiences.</p><p>Children in the under two section, benefit from the calm climate that fosters their physical, social and emotional wellbeing. These younger children are well supported to develop their language and independence as they explore their environment. The programme for older children in the preschool has a specific emphasis on children’s transition to school. Children often visit the school and share special events there.</p><p>Cultural events are celebrated as part of the programme. Teachers are making sustained efforts to increase their use of te reo and tikanga Māori practices. Centre leaders recognise that there is potential to strengthen children’s knowledge and awareness of their bicultural heritage and relevant local history.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers work well together as highly collegial teams. Managers and team leaders provide clear and effective documented guidelines for all centre operations. Staff are encouraged to be reflective, and professional development is well supported.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner and manager, and ERO, agree that the next step for the centre is to review its current philosophy statement, in consultation with staff and parents/whānau. The revised statement of vision, values and beliefs is likely to provide a clear point of reference for in-depth self review of aspects of the programme and operations.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Impressions Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a</p><p>potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Impressions Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>24 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
