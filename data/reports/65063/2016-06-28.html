</table><p>Prebbleton Childcare and Education Centre are well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Prebbleton Childcare and Education Centre is one of four centres owned and operated by the same managers. Three of these centres are located in Prebbleton.</p><p>This childcare and education centre is licensed for a small group of children aged over two years old. Most children are aged between three and five years old. The centre is situated adjacent to the nursery centre. This close proximity supports planned and positive transitions for the many children who move from the nursery to the childcare and education centre.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in May 2013, there have been significant changes in the staffing at the centre. A new supervisor was appointed in January 2016. All staff are qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four reviews in the Prebbleton Childcare Ltd Company.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The supervisor and teachers have worked well together to develop a new philosophy that reflects the shared beliefs of the current teaching team and parent values and aspirations for their children.</p><p>The teaching team foster positive and inclusive relationships with children. Teachers place an important emphasis on supporting children’s social skills and sense of wellbeing. Children enjoy caring, nurturing and respectful interactions with teachers. Teachers know the children well and are very responsive to their individual interests, needs and preferences.</p><p>Teachers regularly involve parents in conversations about their children and encourage them to attend events at the centre. These practices promote a good sense of belonging and community for children and families.</p><p>Children are actively involved in a play-based curriculum that provides a wide range of interesting learning experiences and activities. Teachers promote a flexible approach to the structure of the day that provides children with choices within predictable routines. Literacy, mathematics and oral language development are integrated in ways that are meaningful to children. The spacious and natural outdoor area provides children with many opportunities for physical play and exploration.</p><p>Teachers have a good awareness of the importance of reflecting te ao Māori in the curriculum. They are increasingly including aspects of te reo and tikanga Māori in ways that are respectful of the Māori culture. Leaders have recognised the need to have a service-wide approach to further strengthening bicultural perspectives and practices across all of the centres.</p><p>Teachers are being well supported to trial new and useful processes to improve planning for learning for individuals and groups of children. They are skilled at making children’s current interests and learning visible in attractive and informative wall displays. These displays provide some opportunities for children to revisit and celebrate memorable experiences. The next step is to increase ways in which children can reflect on, and be more involved in making decisions about their learning.</p><p>The supervisor has a clear vision for best teaching and learning practice. She works collaboratively with the centre leaders to promote centre improvement.</p><p>Leaders provide useful formats and prompts to support centre internal evaluation and assist in the monitoring of health and safety and compliance practices. The supervisor is helping the team build on their understanding, use and documentation of self-review. Teachers are beginning to reflect more deeply on their practices as a team.</p><p>Leaders have developed clear strategic planning to guide the development of this centre and service overall. They have an increased focus on ensuring accountability with regular informative reports to management. Centre leaders have strengthened the appraisal with clearer expectations and processes. There are now updated policies and procedures.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>As the teaching team embeds its new philosophy, centre leaders have identified, and ERO's findings confirm, consideration needs to be given to strengthening:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>partnerships with local schools to support transition processes for children and families</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers awareness of the self-review processes and the development of a more collaborative approach to documenting and leading self-review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>successfully embed new appraisal processes and further develop some aspects of performance management.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition the centre leaders should also develop ways to evaluate how well-service wide goals are being responded to and met across the centres.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Prebbleton Childcare &amp; Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>28 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
