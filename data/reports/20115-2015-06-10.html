</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tui’s Nest Childcare Centre located in Northcote serves a multicultural community on Auckland’s North Shore. It operates from the ground level of a renovated building, in a semi-commercial area. The centre is licensed for up to 45 children, including 20 up to the age of two years. There are very good ratios of teachers to children.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report noted that children and families benefited from a welcoming and inclusive environment that supported gentle and respectful relationships. It also commented on the high level of care for babies and infants. These features continue to be evident throughout the centre.</p><p>The well qualified teaching team are guided by the principles of <em>Te Whāriki, the early childhood curriculum</em> as well as being inspired and influenced by the education philosophies of Reggio Emilia, Emily Pickler and Magda Gerber. They are reviewing these philosophies to inform the centre’s new vision and programme design.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at Tui’s Nest Childcare benefit from the respect teachers show them in their care and learning. Staff provide a ‘home away from home’. Children have opportunities to play co-operatively with their peers to form genuine friendships. The spacious learning environment provides opportunities for exploration and sustained play. Children have access to a good range of resources that challenge and support their play. They make decisions about their learning and follow their interests. The programme is unhurried allowing children to learn at their own pace.</p><p>Infants and toddlers receive a high level of care. Teachers provide a nurturing and sensitive approach to their wellbeing. This complements the calm environment. The layout of the learning spaces encourages some freedom of movement between babies, toddlers and older children. Teachers could now consider increasing the range of resources available to younger children to further extend learning.</p><p>Teachers have positive relationships with children and each other. They promote children’s social and emotional competencies well as they support and play alongside them. The diverse backgrounds of teachers reflect the cultural and ethnic heritage of the children. Teachers are well placed to continue to extend children’s language development and to support the use of home languages further in the centre programme.</p><p>Teachers are developing good processes for planning and evaluating the programme, and assessing children’s learning. Literacy is integrated within the programme. Teachers are continuing to strengthen mathematics and science learning across all curiculum areas.</p><p>Inclusive practices are evident. Māori children are supported well to develop their understanding of te reo Māori. Teachers are strengthening their knowledge and skills of te reo and tikanga Māori. Further opportunities to extend te ao Māori in the daily programme would support Māori children’s learning and enhance the bicultural curriculum.</p><p>Effective centre leadership is evident. The centre manager and team leaders acknowledge the value of meaningful external professional learning and expertise. Effective self review, developing teacher capability and building leadership among teachers has encouraged a collaborative team approach. Teachers are well placed to develop a shared understanding of effective teaching practices to improve the consistency of teacher practices.</p><p>The centre is well governed and managed. An up-to-date policy framework guides centre practices. The manager and teachers acknowledge the need to review the centre philosophy statement to more clearly reflect Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the bicultural approach in the centre’s curriculum.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager, team leaders and ERO agree that key priorities to continue strengthening are:</p><ul>
<li>the links between programme planning, evaluation and individual children’s assessment</li>
<li>the inclusion of children's perspectives within self-review practices</li>
<li>the use of effective teacher practices to extend and challenge children’s thinking.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tui's Nest Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tui's Nest Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>10 June 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
