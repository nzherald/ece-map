</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Wonders is a new, purpose-built centre that opened in 2011. It is one of 8 centres of the same name nationwide and the first to open in Timaru. The centre is licensed to have 75 children of mixed ages. Teachers provide education and care for children within programmes delivered from four separate rooms – Matai, Tawa, Rimu and Kauri. The manager and two head teachers had been in their roles less than a year at the time of ERO’s visit. Their priority has been to focus on building team relationships and establishing the centre’s preferred ways of working. This is the centre’s first education review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are warmly welcomed by the teachers and staff as they arrive each day at the centre. The teachers in each room have worked well together to support children’s wellbeing through respectful relationships with children and families and with each other. This has helped build the children’s identity and sense of belonging. Teachers actively work to establish partnerships with parents to help understand children’s needs and preferences.</p><p>Children across the service have the opportunity to experience a range of activities within the four programmes. Teachers have had a focus on understanding children’s attitudes to learning and to establish the centres routines and expectations for behaviour.</p><p>The infants in the Matai room are well cared for. Teachers have a flexible programme so that they can provide care that fits in with each child’s home routines. When children reach the stage of needing to move between rooms they are supported by a well-planned process that helps them settle easily.</p><p>Teachers have been investigating ways to improve how their programmes and teaching practices support and extend children’s learning. They are aware that this is work in progress and that they need to establish useful processes to ensure all children have the opportunity to learn and be challenged by the programmes they provide. The manager and teachers have good skills and knowledge. Their next step is to find ways for these to be more visible through practices that show how they extend children’s learning.</p><p>The teachers’ value bicultural and multicultural practices and this is reflected in the environment. Integrating Māori perspectives into programmes is an area for ongoing development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><h4><em>Programmes and practices</em></h4><p>The <em>Te Whāriki Early Childhood Curriculum</em> is beginning to be evident but further development is needed.</p><p>Assessment, programme planning, teaching practice and evaluation processes need development and to be focused on learning for all children individually and in groups.</p><p>Bicultural development and the inclusion of Māori perspectives need to be more consistently evident in the programme so that children’s learning is extended.</p><h4><em>Management and leadership</em></h4><p>Teachers need to revisit the centre philosophy and build a shared understanding across the service about how this will be best demonstrated in practice.</p><p>There is a need to further develop leadership to support and monitor the quality of programmes and teaching practice.</p><p>Self review needs further development to provide for regular review of aspects of the centre operation that most impact on children’s learning.</p><p>Leaders need to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of policies and practices including health and safety procedures.</p><h4>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h4><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Wonders Childcare (Timaru) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Little Wonders Childcare (Timaru) will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>30 October 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
