<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>KidStart is the home-based care and education service provided nationally by Barnardos. KidStart Glen Eden is one of three networks operating under the umbrella of Barnardos Waitakere Area Management Unit (AMU). The service is supported by a framework of policies, systems, documentation and quality standards developed and maintained at national and regional levels.</p><p>KidStart home educators provide care and education for children from birth to five years of age with the support of visiting teachers and other Barnardos staff. Educators are required to complete initial training and regularly attend workshops to maintain current KidStart educator practising certificates.</p><p>Children are cared for in the homes of their educators. Warm, caring relationships give children a sense of belonging and security in educators&rsquo; homes. In the homes that ERO visited during the course of this review, children settle quickly and are confident in their familiar environments. Interactions between children and educators are a positive feature of the service. Home environments are well resourced and children enjoy varied and stimulating experiences.</p><p>Educators are committed to their work and continue to provide good education and care for children. They know the children in their care and their families well and respond to their interests. Home educators appreciate the professional support they receive from the visiting teacher and other KidStart staff.</p><p>Five registered teachers, including a team leader, provide educators with professional guidance and ensure that regulatory requirements are met. Visiting teachers provide good support for educators and help to ensure positive outcomes for children. Strategies for increasing contact with parents have encouraged partnerships to support children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Good quality practices noted in the 2008 ERO report have been sustained. Enhanced self-review and evaluation processes could now be used to support improved learning outcomes for children. Professional development could further strengthen professional leadership skills within the visiting teacher team.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>KidStart Glen Eden KidStart Glen EdenBefore the review, the management ofwas invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided byto contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>KidStart Glen EdenThe detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the service (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults</li>
<li>service support for home-based educators.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>This review of the KidStart Glen Eden network is informed by organisational and area documentation, visits to six educator homes selected by KidStart, interviews with educators and KidStart staff, written feedback from parents, and observations of some programmes for children.</p><p>The visiting teacher for the KidStart Glen Eden network provides support and guidance to 14 educators. She is part of the Waitakere KidStart team, which includes an area manager, team leader, administrator, and three other visiting teachers who support two other networks within the area.</p><h3>Areas of good performance</h3><p>Relationships.Children develop strong relationships with their educators. Their settled behaviour reflects their sense of security and belonging in educators&rsquo; homes. Educators are warm, caring and affectionate with children. Visiting teachers provide affirming and encouraging support for educators and have developed trusting relationships with children.</p><p>Diverse learning environments.Educator home environments are well resourced and reflect the children&rsquo;s interests. Children have daily access to indoor and outdoor play spaces. Educators make good use of community facilities, including music, parks and library visits. They also attend fortnightly KidStart playgroups. These experiences provide children with opportunities to develop friendships and the skills for positive interactions with adults and other children.</p><p>Supporting children&rsquo;s learning and development.Educators are responsive to children&rsquo;s needs and interests. They have a good knowledge of the children in their care, and support them to be independent, competent and confident. Children have access to a variety of experiences to support their developing knowledge and skills in literacy, numeracy and science.</p><p>Progress with assessment.Children&rsquo;s interests are well documented by educators. The educators visited by ERO keep attractive individual portfolios for children, with examples of some high quality written observations of children&rsquo;s experiences. These educators are skilled at supporting children&rsquo;s learning and would be good role models for other educators.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>ERO, the Barnardos area manager, the Waitakere KidStart team leader and visiting teachers agree that priorities for development and review include:</p><ul>
<li>the team leader providing professional leadership for visiting teachers to further develop their professional skills</li>
<li>the area manager and team leader developing a more rigorous appraisal process for visiting teachers</li>
<li>the area manager providing professional development opportunities to challenge and extend the visiting teacher team</li>
<li>visiting teachers using playgroup records to model the planning, assessment and evaluation cycle for educators</li>
<li>visiting teachers identifying and documenting targeted next steps to further improve educators&rsquo; skills in promoting children&rsquo;s care and education</li>
<li>visiting teachers encouraging educators to promote increased parent contributions to the assessment of their children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><p>Developments in these areas would assist Waitakere KidStart personnel to sustain and improve the good quality practices that have already been established.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Findings</h3><p>The visiting teacher and educators in the Glen Eden network have responsibility for the care and education of one child of M&#257;ori descent.</p><p>The BarnardosNga Pou E WhaM&#257;ori strategy aims for the service to build partnerships with M&#257;ori, be effective for M&#257;ori, be responsive to M&#257;ori, and ensure participation by M&#257;ori. KidStart is beginning to build connections with Ma&#333;ri organisations and iwi. This initiative could increase the number of M&#257;ori educators and help to ensure that the service is attractive to M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau.</p><p>The Waitakere KidStart team members have recently completed professional development to guide them in incorporating the Barnardos M&#257;ori strategy into their own and educator practices. They could now use the Ministry of Education&rsquo;s strategy for M&#257;ori success,Ka Hikitia,as a resource to support them in this work.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>KidStart Glen Eden Before the review, the management and staff ofcompleted an EROHome-Based CareManagement Assurance StatementandSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><p>8 July 2011</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kidstart-glen-eden" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of&nbsp;KidStart Glen Eden</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on KidStart is the home-based care and education service provided nationally by Barnardos. KidStart Glen Eden is one of three networks operating under the umbrella of Barnardos Waitakere Area Management Unit (AMU). The service is supported by a framework of policies, systems, documentation and quality standards developed and maintained at national and regional levels.</p><p>KidStart home educators provide care and education for children from birth to five years of age with the support of visiting teachers and other Barnardos staff. Educators are required to complete initial training and regularly attend workshops to maintain current KidStart educator practising certificates.</p><p>Children are cared for in the homes of their educators. Warm, caring relationships give children a sense of belonging and security in educators&rsquo; homes. In the homes that ERO visited during the course of this review, children settle quickly and are confident in their familiar environments. Interactions between children and educators are a positive feature of the service. Home environments are well resourced and children enjoy varied and stimulating experiences.</p><p>Educators are committed to their work and continue to provide good education and care for children. They know the children in their care and their families well and respond to their interests. Home educators appreciate the professional support they receive from the visiting teacher and other KidStart staff.</p><p>Five registered teachers, including a team leader, provide educators with professional guidance and ensure that regulatory requirements are met. Visiting teachers provide good support for educators and help to ensure positive outcomes for children. Strategies for increasing contact with parents have encouraged partnerships to support children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>Good quality practices noted in the 2008 ERO report have been sustained. Enhanced self-review and evaluation processes could now be used to support improved learning outcomes for children. Professional development could further strengthen professional leadership skills within the visiting teacher team.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO will review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood service we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the service or see the ERO website, www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood services; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each service&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p>Quality of Education&ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Additional Review Priorities&ndash; other aspects of the operation of a service, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p>National Evaluation Topics&ndash; This strand contribute to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p>Compliance with Legal Requirements&ndash; assurance that this service has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this service.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a service is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this service.</p></html>
