</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Valley Kindergarten is a purpose built facility. Children from two up to five years of age attend the centre. The centre offers all day care and education for children with the majority of children attending five days a week on a sessional basis. A few children attend for the whole day.</p><p>The centre’s community is diverse. The majority of children are Pacific and Māori. The children’s cultures are reflected and promoted in the centre’s environment. The centre is designed with one central room for all children. This helps to create a sense of whānau for all children.</p><p>The centre manager and head teacher are the owners of the centre. As a management team they nurture relationships and communication with families. The owners have a commitment to local families and ensure they are available to talk with parents on a daily basis.</p><p>The owners have responded positively to recommendations in the 2013 ERO report. However, continued development is necessary to fully address some of the 2013 recommendations.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play in a settled calm environment. Older and younger children respond positively to the opportunity to play together. Teachers foster the tuakana teina relationships that develop naturally amongst children. The centre is responsive to children’s cultures. For example, Māori and Pacific culture is reflected in the day to day programme through music, te reo Māori, karakia and art.</p><p>Children gather informally at mat times. They enjoy music, the beat of drums and Pacifica songs and dancing. They are highly engaged and teachers are responsive to their requests for songs, actions and dance.</p><p>The head teacher has developed effective ways of sharing children’s participation in the programme with parents and whānau. A daily recording folder allows whānau to see children’s activity and participation as it happened on the day. Children’s individual portfolios provide good insights into their play. A next step for teachers is to use this collected information to decide and document how they are going to extend learning opportunities for each child.</p><p>Children enjoy learning in an environment where teachers know them and their families well. Teachers are attentive and encouraging towards children. However, there is some variability in the quality of teacher interactions to support and extend children’s learning. ERO and managers agree that teachers could consider how to use the numerous centre resources to promote open-ended learning for children. Particular attention should be given to encouraging children’s problem solving, creativity and curiosity.</p><p>Children have access to many new resources and an extensive outdoor area. Since opening in 2012 there have been additions and improvements to the building. These have resulted in children having ample sheltered and well covered areas for playing in during wet weather.</p><p>Children would benefit from having access to a greater range of developmental play areas every day. For example, children would enjoy learning from water play, carpentry, messy play and soft construction.</p><p>Centre self-review captures some ongoing staff reflections and focuses on aspects of the curriculum. The owners are keen to develop self review further by seeking a wider range of perspectives and using research to create indicators and guide teachers’ reflections. Analysing the information gathered through self review and using it to make decisions would be a positive next step.</p><p>The head teacher takes responsibility for professional development and teachers’ appraisals. While the appraisal process meets requirements, teachers need more opportunities to develop professionally. The head teacher agrees that this is a next step for all professional staff at the centre.</p><p>The head teacher would benefit from an external appraisal. This would help her to lead improvements to the quality of teaching and learning and curriculum development. This is planned for 2016.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO recommends managers seek external support to address the following development priorities which include:</p><ul>
<li>extending the range of developmental play areas available for children</li>
<li>extending and enhancing learning opportunities for each child</li>
<li>using self review to make well-informed decisions about the curriculum</li>
<li>linking teacher appraisals to Education Council Requirements</li>
<li>ensuring that the head teacher is externally appraised.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Valley Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Valley Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>16 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
