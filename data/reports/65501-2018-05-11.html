</table><p>The centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Uptown Preschool is one of three centres governed by Blenheim Early Childhood Centres Inc. (BECC). Each centre operates independently with their own Head Teacher. The centres are governed by a Board who are elected members. A business manager oversees the business aspects of the service. An education advisor supports teaching and learning across the centres.</p><p>Most staff are qualified and certified teachers.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 34 children aged from 2 years to 5 years. Children attending the centre reflect the diverse cultural groups in the local community.</p><p>The centre management and teachers have made significant progress in the areas identified in the ERO 2015 report. Internal evaluation and assessment, programme planning and evaluation have improved. Teachers have a better understanding of supporting Māori children. The board is well informed about the curriculum.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster where ERO reviewed all three of the centres in the Blenheim Early Childhood Centres Inc.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's programme strongly reflects the philosophy in practice. Children are well supported to be confident and competent learners.</p><p>Teaching practices appropriately support children to engage in sustained, purposeful play and learning. Children's independence, social skills and self-management are promoted. Children's oral language development is well supported.</p><p>Children make effective use of well-resourced learning areas that encourages them to develop physical and problems solving skills. Practices that support children's transitions to school are embedded throughout the programme.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively, sharing responsibilities for all children's learning and development. Programme planning and assessment practices are focused on enhancing children's learning. Assessment and planning clearly show learning outcomes for children. Records of learning show very good analysis of children's learning and next steps. These profiles and an online tool allow families to have access and contribute to their children's learning experiences.</p><p>Bicultural perspectives are well integrated into learning experiences. Children and teachers use te reo Māori confidently in conversations. Tikanga practices are successfully integrated into daily routines and reflect the teaching team's commitment to a bicultural curriculum.</p><p>Effective leadership is promoting collaboration and cooperation within the team. The teaching team is reflective and collegial. The individual strengths of teachers are valued and used well to support and extend children's learning.</p><p>Internal evaluation guides decision making and continuous improvements. Actions taken as a result of internal evaluation enhance children's learning experiences and their environment. Teachers' current evaluation focus on the principles of Tātaiako, Cultural Competencies of Māori Learners, is helping to strengthen practices and enrich learning experiences for the children.</p><p>A culture of ongoing improvement is well embedded across the organisation. Leaders foster teachers' and parents' shared understanding of the centre philosophy, vision and goals. They consult parents and teachers and use their responses to inform strategic planning on improving outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre has very good management systems and processes. Governance policies and procedures are regularly reviewed to guide professional practice. Professional growth is encouraged to build teachers' knowledge and leadership capability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree, that the next key steps to improve outcomes for children are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen links to children's heritage, language and culture including families aspirations</li>
<li>further embed the current appraisal system across the teaching team.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Blenheim Early Childhood Centres Inc-Uptown Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Blenheim Early Childhood Centres Inc-Uptown Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>11 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
