<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Fetu Taiala Aoga Amata is a long-established early childhood centre. Located on the Southern Cross campus alongside four other Pacific centres, the premises are overseen by the Mangere Pacific ECE Trust. The centre is managed effectively by the Tava&rsquo;esina Trust, made up from parents and community members. The two Trusts work in partnership to ensure that the centre is well placed to provide high quality education and care.</p><p>The centre has had a positive reporting history in recent times. Since the last ERO review there have been changes to centre management. Centre managers responded positively to the 2009 ERO report and have participated in a wide range of professional development. There is strong strategic vision and planning and an increased emphasis on self review.</p><p>The centre provides total immersion Samoan language. It reflects Christian values and aspects of Samoan traditions. Most children are competent, capable learners who are strong in their sense of belonging and identity. The centre is inclusive of all children from diverse backgrounds and acknowledges the Treaty of Waitangi and M&#257;ori as tangata whenua.</p><p>Children are confident communicators in Samoan language and they use this as their language in play, social and learning situations. This enables them to make meaningful connections between home, centre and community experiences. Teachers are thinking about innovative ways to support children&rsquo;s ongoing language development as they transition to school.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive outcomes for children. To reach these findings ERO evaluates:</p><ul>
<li>Mana Whakahaere &ndash; how governance and management determines the services&rsquo; vision/philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou&#257;rahi &ndash; how the leadership and capability of all involved, including educators, enhances positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is implemented to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning reflect diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within all these areas, ERO considers how the quality and sustainability of partnerships with wh&#257;nau, and the effectiveness of self review, ensure that the service is well placed to continue to make improvements for the benefit of all children attending the service. ERO&rsquo;s findings are set out below.</p><h3>How well placed is Fetu Taiala Aoga Amata to promote positive outcomes for all children?</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Since the last ERO report, the management committee have appointed an effective centre manager and supervisor. Both leaders are proactive and skilled in their roles and responsibilities. Staff qualification levels have improved and teachers have participated in a wide range of external professional development including leadership and management. Despite the limited space of the centre, teachers have worked hard to create a purposeful, stimulating environment for children.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><ul>
<li>The programme is designed to ensure that children understand their heritage, the importance of tikanga M&#257;ori and to support children&rsquo;s sense of identity as Samoan citizens of Aotearoa.</li>
<li>Children show a strong sense of identity and pride as young Samoan learners. They are competent and confident in Samoan language and they have many opportunities to learn from their own experiences of Samoan culture.</li>
<li>The centre has a family atmosphere that is welcoming and inclusive. Children settle in quickly and confidently choose areas of play. Teachers support children&rsquo;s choices.</li>
<li>Teachers model good examples of Samoan language and positive social and emotional behaviour. Consequently, teachers and children, and children and their peers experience positive relationships.</li>
<li>Teachers identify children&rsquo;s interests and extend their learning. They effectively support child-initiated play.</li>
<li>Children are confident communicators. They are articulate and are motivated to share ideas and knowledge.</li>
<li>Transitions during the day are smooth and well managed with good opportunities for children to take leadership roles and increase their sense of responsibility and self-esteem.</li>
<li>Teachers respond to children&rsquo;s needs. They set clear expectations of behaviour and daily routines. Teachers have high expectations of children&rsquo;s capabilities. Children know what to do.</li>
<li>The supervisor and teachers have worked together to improve the links between planning, assessment and evaluation for individual and groups of children.</li>
<li>Teachers make purposeful use of the environment. Aspects of literacy and numeracy are skilfully blended in the programme and this is evident in the resources available.</li>
</ul><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>Centre managers have identified the following areas for further development and review.</p><ul>
<li>Teachers could consider ways to be more creative and innovative with planning, assessment and evaluation.</li>
<li>Centre managers should continue to strengthen self review and reflective practice in order to ensure that they foster ongoing, sustained improvement.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Fetu Taiala Aoga Amata completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

It reflects Christian values and aspects of Samoan traditions. Most children are competent, capable learners who are strong in their sense of belonging and identity. The centre is inclusive of all children from diverse backgrounds and acknowledges the Treaty of Waitangi and M&#257;ori as tangata whenua.</p><p>Children are confident communicators in Samoan language and they use this as their language in play, social and learning situations. This enables them to make meaningful connections between home, centre and community experiences. Teachers are thinking about innovative ways to support children&rsquo;s ongoing language development as they transition to school.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
