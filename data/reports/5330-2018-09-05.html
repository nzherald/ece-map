</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Koraunui Kindergarten is located in Stokes Valley. It is licensed to provide all day education and care for up to 40 children, aged over two years. At the time of this ERO review, 25 of the children enrolled identify as Māori and eight as of Pacific heritage.</p><p>The centre philosophy focuses on providing opportunities for children to learn best in an environment that promotes their culture, identity, creativity and curiosity and fosters their independence.</p><p>All teachers are fully qualified. Day-to-day operation of the centre is the responsibility of the head teacher, who supports the teaching team. Since the June 2015 ERO evaluation, the outdoor learning space has been developed to further support and extend children's learning.</p><p>Koraunui Kindergarten is one of 19 services in the Lower Hutt region, governed and managed by Hutt City Kindergarten Association (the association). Since the previous ERO evaluation, a new senior leadership team has been appointed. This includes a general manager and two senior teachers, guided by a team leader. The governance board has also undergone significant changes.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified key areas requiring further development. These included: developing good practice indicators on the teaching philosophy; increasing the range of literacies in the programme; shared understanding of assessment; and building teachers’ evaluative capacity. Good progress has been made in addressing these areas.</p><p>Areas requiring development were also identified for the association. These included: strategic planning; cultural responsiveness to Māori and Pacific families; evaluation; and the appraisal process. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergartens in the Hutt City Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate and lead their learning in a play-based programme. The natural environment encourages them to explore, interact, experiment and have fun. They experience warm and respectful relationships. Independence and self-management are fostered throughout the kindergarten. Teachers work alongside children supporting their play and learning. Older children work confidently and collaboratively with younger peers. Tuakana teina relationships are actively encouraged.</p><p>The centre philosophy was developed in collaboration by the teaching team. Parent and whānau aspirations were also used to help them to determine key valued learning outcomes for children. Leaders should consider ways to work collaboratively with their parents, whānau Māori and their Pacific community to gain a better understanding of what educational success looks like for them.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported in their learning and wellbeing. Teachers work in partnership with the families, whānau, and outside agencies when appropriate, to plan and monitor their progress.</p><p>Group planning focuses on children’s emerging interests. Teachers develop appropriate learning experiences and intentional teaching strategies focused on dispositional learning. Parents, whānau and teachers co-construct meaningful learning goals to support their child’s individual needs. These form the basis for individualised planning. Senior teachers have identified areas requiring further improvement including developing specific learning outcomes for children, and assessment documentation to show greater progression in their learning. ERO's external evaluation affirms this direction.</p><p>Te ao Māori is well promoted in the kindergarten. Children celebrate and share their pepeha with their peers and in their learning stories. Teachers use aspects of kaupapa Māori to enrich the naturebased programme. A key next step is to encourage teachers to use te reo Māori in everyday practice in the kindergarten. In addition, leaders should consider ways they can weave a place-based curriculum that promotes and celebrates te ao Māori unique to Stokes Valley.</p><p>Clear internal evaluation expectations are provided for staff. Senior teachers work collaboratively with the teaching team to build their evaluative understanding. Teachers are beginning to deepen their knowledge and understanding of how they can evaluate the impact of their practices on children’s learning. Leaders acknowledge that a continued focus on outcomes for children is a key next step in this process.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate a strong commitment to the vision, values and philosophy of the kindergarten. Collaborative ways of working are fostered. Teachers are encouraged to lead aspects of the programme.</p><p>A comprehensive, well-considered appraisal process is in place. Teachers challenge themselves to continually improve their practice through strategic goal-setting and professional learning. Plans are in place to further strengthen this system by developing an inquiry-based approach to teacher appraisal.</p><p>The governance board includes a wide range of community representation and useful skills. The board and senior leadership team work well together, with a shared commitment to meeting its goals and objectives for the benefit of children, whānau and community. Resource allocation clearly aligns with this focus. The board and senior leadership actively seek equitable and inclusive ways to eliminate barriers to children’s learning and wellbeing.</p><p>ERO, the governance board and senior leaders agree that the association's next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>monitor, evaluate and report on the extent to which children and their families’ outcomes are improved though systems, processes and initiatives. This should include consideration of impact on specific priority groups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider ways to increase opportunities for whānau to actively contribute to the association’s operation and strategic direction.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association's senior teaching team is reflective and highly improvement focused. Robust, linked systems and processes have been skilfully developed to guide and grow teacher capability and positively impact children’s learning. Leaders successfully foster a collective sense of responsibility for the vision, values and mission of the association.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten teachers agree that their priority next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>work collaboratively with parents, whānau and families to review the philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a place-based curriculum as well as encouraging greater use of te reo Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to build internal evaluation knowledge and understanding.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association agrees they should increase the focus on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>measuring outcomes for children and their families</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing whānau and community partnership practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Koraunui Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Koraunui Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>5 September 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
