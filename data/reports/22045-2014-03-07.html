</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Narrowneck Playcentre is a well established centre that runs as a parent cooperative. The playcentre was established in 1974 and some current members came to the centre as children. Centre practices are based on the playcentre philosophy of families learning and growing together. The centre is open for family sessions four days a week and also offers one supervised extension session for older children. It caters for children from birth to school age.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO report the centre has continued to renovate and improve the indoor and outdoor play areas in response to children’s interests and needs. Centre members have been involved in professional development to strengthen their self-review practices. They have reviewed and made changes to children’s assessment portfolios. They have also reflected on the structure of the ‘Big Kid’ sessions to ensure alignment with playcentre philosophy and the extra challenge wanted by centre members for their children. A feature of the centre is the strong sense of community. Effective parent leadership and association support contributes to the success of this centre.</p><p>The playcentre operates as part of the North Shore Playcentre Association. The association is the umbrella organisation for 21 playcentres situated in North Auckland. Many of these centres are semi-rural. The association manages and distributes funding to centres and provides a training programme for parents/whānau to achieve playcentre qualifications. It also has good systems to support centre members to manage the playcentres and to provide educational programmes for children. The association is currently reviewing many aspects of its operations to help reduce the administrative workload for its members.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews in the North Shore Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Narrowneck Playcentre is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children. An enthusiastic group of centre members are committed to providing a quality programme for their children based on playcentre philosophy and <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. They engage in ongoing learning through course workshops and take turns at being responsible for key leadership and administrative roles. Several members also hold positions at Playcentre Association level.</p><p>Children and their families are welcomed into the centre. They settle quickly in the calm environment and engage in purposeful play with or alongside friends and family for long periods of time. Centre members work with children, nurturing their independence and sense of responsibility. Children have good social skills and enjoy positive relationships with other children and adults. Older children model for their younger peers through their play. Children have well developed language skills and confidently invite other children or adults into their play, or ask for additional resources.</p><p>Centre members use their considerable professional skills and hobbies to enhance the playcentre programme and environment. They have regular input into planning a programme that meets the needs of individual children and the aspirations of their parents and whānau. Children’s voice is a strength of the programme. Regular evaluation of the quality of sessional planning supports the continuity of group and individual learning opportunities. LEAP (learning, evaluation, assessment and planning) meetings help ensure that the curriculum is extended from one session to the next. Good communication between centre members promotes continuity between sessions and keeps families well informed.</p><p>Bicultural perspectives are evident in the programme and are reflected in displays, resources and activities that value Māori culture. Centre members and children are learning waiata and some te reo Māori words and phrases together. A bicultural partnership with Māori whānau is evident in association operations and embraced by the centre’s management team.</p><p>The playcentre is situated in an old villa. The building has been beautifully restored with the redesign of some features to provide interesting, creative spaces for the different areas of play. The indoor and outdoor areas are well resourced to encourage children to explore, investigate and engage in imaginative play.</p><p>In order to retain older children, the ‘Big Kids’ extension session has been reviewed to ensure it supports children’s transition into school well. Programmes are child initiated and are planned with input from children and their parents. These programmes are designed to extend children’s development, give older children opportunities to interact with their own age group and prepare them for transitioning into school. Most playcentre children now remain enrolled at the centre until they begin school.</p><p>Effective self-review strategies are guiding improvement and enabling centre members to manage change in a considered manner. Self review has been particularly well used to improve the environment and centre practices. Centre members have developed a personalised annual plan and mission statement for Narrowneck Playcentre to guide their practice.</p><p>The association management team takes responsibility for specific tasks relating to the function of the association. Management team members are committed to and enthusiastic about their involvement in playcentre. They actively foster emergent leadership. This helps sustain the association and demonstrate the professional leadership necessary to help the association respond to change, make decisions and manage issues as they arise. The North Shore Playcentre Association provides effective support to help this playcentre remain very well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre members agree that parents/whānau could continue to improve assessment practices and evaluation to show progress and continuity over time.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Narrowneck Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Narrowneck Playcentre will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>7 March 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
