</table><p><span lang="mi">Mokopuna</span> Early C E and Care Centre requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p><span lang="mi">Mokopuna</span> Early C E and Care Centre needs to improve curriculum provision, health and safety, and governance systems to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p><span lang="mi">Mokopuna</span> Early C E and Care Centre is one of five early childhood services, including two in Auckland, governed by <span lang="mi">He Puna Marama</span> Trust (the Trust). <span lang="mi">Ngā pouako</span> (teachers) and the Trust give emphasis to <span lang="mi">te ao Māori</span> and culturally responsive practices that promote success for Māori.</p><p>Four <span lang="mi">pouako</span> are registered teachers. There are three unqualified staff. A head teacher has responsibility for daily management of the centre. The Trust provides governance and personnel to support curriculum development and management systems in individual centres.</p><p>ERO's 2016 report recognised teachers' positive interactions with children and their effective communication with whānau. Areas for improvement included curriculum and resourcing, teacher appraisal, self review and strategic planning processes. Some progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>There is a positive tone in the centre. <span lang="mi">Pepi</span> settle confidently, and actively explore the environment. They have frequent access to indoor and outdoor play. Older <span lang="mi">tamariki</span> develop social relationships with other children and spend time in focused activities of their choice. They are independent learners who demonstrate leadership skills and know the centre routines well.</p><p>Teachers’ interactions with children are respectful and caring. Their conversations acknowledge children’s interests and show that they know children and whānau well. <span lang="mi">Pouako</span> make suggestions to encourage children to try new experiences.</p><p><span lang="mi">Tamariki</span> experience a curriculum that celebrates <span lang="mi">tikanga</span> and <span lang="mi">te reo Māori</span>. They are confident in their Māori culture and are well supported to share their <span lang="mi">pepeha. Pouako</span> incorporate <span lang="mi">kupu Māori</span> naturally into conversations and daily experiences. <span lang="mi">Tamariki</span> actively participate in <span lang="mi">whakatau</span> to welcome <span lang="mi">manuhiri</span>. Whānau who spoke with ERO appreciate the centre's commitment to <span lang="mi">te ao Māori</span>.</p><p>Curriculum planning, assessment and evaluation records are an area for development. <span lang="mi">Pouako</span> write individual learning plans for <span lang="mi">tamariki</span> but are not yet using these plans well to document and assess children's learning. They could document how they respond to and extend the spontaneous interests of <span lang="mi">tamariki</span> and show their learning over time.</p><p>Teachers have reviewed centre routines and the resourcing provided for <span lang="mi">tamariki</span>. A focus on improving and evaluating teaching practices could help the relatively new teaching team to develop shared understandings about effective teaching practices. Developing meaningful annual and long-term goals that are specific for this centre could support <span lang="mi">pouako</span> to have greater ownership of ongoing improvements.</p><p>A strong <span lang="mi">kaupapa Māori</span> framework guides the Trust's vision for children to experience success as Māori. The commitment of <span lang="mi">pouako</span> and Trust leaders to this vision is highly evident. Further professional development would be useful to help leaders improve teacher appraisal systems. Closer monitoring of how well regulatory requirements are being maintained, particularly relating to children's health and safety, is required.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for pouako include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improving the quality of evaluation, planning, and assessment of children’s learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refining internal evaluation processes to show the impact of the curriculum and teaching practices on improved outcomes for <span lang="mi">tamariki</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing and evaluating meaningful annual and long-term goals that are specific to this centre.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Key next steps for the Trust include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improving teacher appraisal systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that regulatory requirements are being maintained.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of <span lang="mi">Mokopuna</span> Early C E and Care Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Since the onsite visit, the service has provided ERO with evidence that shows it has addressed a non-compliance relating to the review of the service's written emergency plan.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to health and safety and governance. To meet requirements the Trust must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>parents are informed about all injuries, illnesses and incidents that occur at the service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all children’s workers who have access to children are correctly safety checked in accordance with the Children's Act 2014</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the written procedure for safety checking all children's workers is used to document a risk assessment of results from safety checks.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS27, GMA7A.</em></p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends the Ministry follows up with the service provider to ensure that non-compliances identified in this report are addressed promptly.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>13 March 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
