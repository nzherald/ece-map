</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><p>Background</p><p>Mangapapa Kindergarten is an all day education and care service licensed for 40 children aged from two to five years of age. It operates for six hours, Monday to Thursday, and four hours and fifteen minutes on Friday. The head teacher has recently been appointed. There is one permanent teacher and two relieving teachers and they are supported by the teacher aide.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy and 'key learning areas' are being reviewed. Over the past three years, Gisborne Kindergarten Association (the association) has provided professional support for teachers focused on assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the association. Two senior teachers are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six kindergartens in the Gisborne Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in a play-based programme and work collaboratively in groups of their choosing. Teachers engage in play and conversations with children and make links to previous experiences to support their learning.</p><p>The programme is underpinned by <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Routines provide a structure for the day. Children enjoy trips to the local and wider community as an extension to the programme and their learning.</p><p>Teachers' understanding of what the philosophy and 'key learning areas' mean for how they teach, needs review and development. Part of this is to consider how teachers can further support children to make choices and engage in more frequent sustained play.</p><p>The teaching team is newly established and supportive of one another. They are warm, welcoming and respectful. Teachers draw on shared knowledge to decide on the programme.</p><p>Children with special educational needs are supported. Teachers work with external agencies where appropriate.</p><p>The teaching team is committed to establishing relationships with families and wh&#257;nau. Parents' aspirations are sought and contribute to goal setting for children. Information about local schools is provided for parents and processes are in place to support children as they transition to school.</p><p>Some teachers use te reo M&#257;ori and are positive role models for bicultural practices within the kindergarten. Using these strengths to continue to develop the bicultural programme should further enhance opportunities for all children.</p><p>Teachers have identified some strategies to help all children enjoy success through their own cultural identity. Continuing to develop these strategies should further support M&#257;ori children to have success as Maori. These strategies also promote the language, culture and identity of Pacific children.</p><p>A recently developed assessment, planning and evaluation process is in place. Children&rsquo;s stories in portfolios link to the &lsquo;key learning areas&rsquo; and highlight their engagement, developing friendships and, at times, learning. These should be further strengthened by identifying what important learning has occurred and children&rsquo;s progress over time. Teachers should also consider how teaching adds depth and complexity to children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>The association provides high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>robust guiding documents and comprehensive policies</li>
<li>clear expectations for programme delivery and Kindergarten operations including health and safety practices</li>
<li>strong leadership</li>
<li>professional learning and development for staff</li>
<li>sound supporting processes for provisionally registered teachers.</li>
</ul><p>Senior teachers should undertake strategic review and evaluation across the association and use this information to inform decision making. They should also support teachers to build their evaluative capacity to systematically enquire into the effectiveness of their practice to further improve positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The association has identified that the reporting of the outcomes of the strategic plan should be more systematic and the implementation of the appraisal process requires review. ERO agrees with this direction.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers, leaders and ERO agree that teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>develop their understanding of the philosophy and how teaching can support its intent</li>
<li>revisit and implement assessment, planning and evaluation processes in a robust way</li>
<li>continue to strengthen the bicultural programme</li>
<li>continue to build their evaluative capacity.</li>
</ul><p>The association's key next steps should include:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing the implementation of the appraisal process</li>
<li>undertaking formal strategic self review at association level.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mangapapa Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mangapapa Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>4 August 2014</p><p><img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" title=""></p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
