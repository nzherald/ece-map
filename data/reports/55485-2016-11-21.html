</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Taokotaianga Apii Kuki Airani Early Childhood Centre (TAKAH) is located in Akina, Hastings. It provides education and care for children from birth to school age and a programme that promotes Cook Islands language and culture.</p><p>The centre is owned and governed by Taokotaianga Apii Kuki Airani Hastings Incorporated Society. Half of the children enrolled are New Zealand Maori and a quarter are Cook Islands M&#257;ori and Samoan. It is licensed for 58 children, with up to 15 under the age of two years. The new governance committee comprises a long serving and experienced chairperson and centre manager, new trustees as well as staff, parents and community members.</p><p>The centre is organised into three separate age groups, Tiare Kaute (under 2 years), Tiare Maori (2-3 years) and Tiare Taina (4 years). Each room is led by an experienced head teacher. The centre manager is currently leading Tiare Taina until a new head teacher is appointed. The centre is staffed by seven registered teachers and six unqualified staff, three of whom are studying towards early childhood qualifications.</p><p>The manager was appointed in 2011. Together with the chairperson, her leadership has been key to the ongoing commitment to improvement.</p><p>The 2013 ERO review acknowledged positive progress in governance and management and growing partnerships with parents. Areas for development were identified in internal evaluation and curriculum. Some improvements are evident in these areas, but staff changes have hindered sustained progress and these continue to be areas for the staff and governance committee to develop.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience many opportunities to learn about their culture and are generally well supported to develop social and emotional competence. Teachers model sharing, turn taking and gentle interactions and provide positive guidance for children. Children experience a programme that gives them choices throughout the indoor and outdoor environments. Te reo Kuki Airani Maori is integrated throughout the programme. Teachers also emphasise a bicultural curriculum through te reo Maori.</p><p>Infants and toddlers receive nurturing care. Teachers' review of the environment to support safe exploration for the youngest children has been a worthwhile inquiry.</p><p>There is good leadership capacity in the centre to grow consistent curriculum practices across the teams. Teachers notice children's emerging interests and respond through a review process. This involves teachers collaboratively deciding how to support a learning area through resourcing and design of the environment. Teachers should continue to improve their responsiveness through a planned approach and further extend children's interests through conversation. Teacher's foster positive relationships with parents and this should assist in strengthening partnerships that support learning.</p><p>The committee and centre leaders have a shared vision that aligns well with the centre philosophy and community aspirations. The committee is reviewing the constitution to align it more fully with the centre's philosophy and practices. Centre leaders have participated in professional development to establish self-review processes. This should support them to continue to be evaluative about the effectiveness of their practice in promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The committee and managers are taking a considered approach to making a head teacher appointment that aligns with the centre's philosophy and team culture. They are mindful that staff appointments should contribute to building the collective capability of the team.</p><p>Teachers' professional growth and development is underpinned by a centre culture of reflection and improvement. The manager is participating in a support programme that should help to improve the centre's operation and record keeping including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teacher appraisal and documented professional development</p>
</li>
<li>financial management and reporting annually audited accounts to the community.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The committee and leaders agree that next steps for centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation so that children's learning is more visible</p>
</li>
<li>and responsive to their individual interests</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the use of assessment to plan for children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seeking further training for committee members about their governance role.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Taokotaianga Apii Kuki Airani Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Taokotaianga Apii Kuki Airani Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>21 November 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on ERO&rsquo;s website.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
