<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Kiwi Kapers Care and Education Centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Kiwi Kapers Care and Education Centre in Glen Eden, provides education and care for children between two and five years of age. The centre&rsquo;s philosophy promotes a learning focused centre that celebrates and draws upon the diversity of cultures and experiences of children and their families.</p><p>A positive feature is the low staff turn-over and a high number of qualified teachers. One of the owners holds the head teacher role.</p><p>Effective leadership and management have had a positive impact on centre improvement. Professional learning and development (PLD) has supported staff to be more confident and capable in using te reo M&#257;ori with ng&#257; tamariki. Staff have used recommendations from the 2010 ERO report to guide self review and centre development.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Strong relationships between staff and families continue to be a feature of the centre. Teachers know children well and provide very good care.</p><p>Children play collaboratively and are well supported by teachers to settle into the centre and to develop their social skills and learning. Teachers&rsquo; positioning and thoughtful resourcing of different areas of play enhances child-led learning. Mat times are well paced and cater for children&rsquo;s interests. Most interactions between children and teachers are warm and reciprocal and affirm children as capable learners.</p><p>As a result of effective whole-centre PLD, teachers have refined the way they plan and assess in order to cater for individual children&rsquo;s strengths and interests. This development has contributed to teachers more effectively supporting children to extend their thinking. There are increased opportunities for children to become involved in complex and imaginative play.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to different children&rsquo;s cultures, backgrounds and experiences. Parents value the way staff acknowledge and celebrate their children&rsquo;s language, culture and identity. The bicultural principles of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, are evident in the positive interactions between teachers and wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children. Teachers&rsquo; frequent and authentic use of te reo M&#257;ori provides opportunities for children to experience te ao M&#257;ori. Children benefit from hearing and using te reo M&#257;ori, karakia and waiata during the day. Good quality teacher support is also evident for Pacific children and children with special needs.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO report, self-review processes have helped staff become more reflective about their teaching practice. Staff discuss how they can effectively respond, both individually and as a team, to what they notice and recognise in children&rsquo;s learning. Reviews of provision for science and information and communication technologies (ICT) have had a positive influence on the programme. Children have very good opportunities to investigate and think about the world around them. They confidently use electronic devices to access interactive games. Parents are able to view their children&rsquo;s learning stories online.</p><p>Changes in leadership structures have provided opportunities for teachers to take a more active role in programme planning and evaluation. The centre owner has also encouraged teachers to be more involved in leading self review and making decisions to benefit children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>To further improve centre practice, ERO and centre leaders agree that self-review documentation could be more prominently displayed to encourage child and parent, wh&#257;nau and aiga contributions to centre development. The head teacher is also keen for staff to revisit the impact of different centre developments over time to ensure that centre philosophy and practice remain aligned.</p><p>The centre is well led and managed. Effective teacher support from the co-owner, in her role of head teacher, has led to positive changes in teaching practice. Strategic planning is used effectively to focus on future improvements. Recent refinements to the centre&rsquo;s appraisal system assist teachers to develop reflective practice and deepen their evaluation skills. Staff share a commitment to sustaining the centre&rsquo;s positive tone and improvements.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiwi Kapers Care and Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>25 March 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
