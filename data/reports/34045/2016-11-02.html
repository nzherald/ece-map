</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Colville Bay Pre-School is located in the small coastal settlement of Colville on the Coromandel Peninsula. It is situated in the grounds of Colville school, and provides education and care services in a mixed-age setting for children from birth to school age. The centre is licensed for 26 children, including a maximum of eight under two years of age. The roll has increased since the 2013 ERO report, and is currently 15, with one child identified as Māori.</p><p>The centre operates as an Incorporated Society and is governed by a management committee which is elected annually. This committee retains responsibility for employment, finance, property and strategic planning. The head teacher continues to provide strong professional leadership and daily operational management. The centre retains a core group of experienced, qualified teachers.</p><p>The philosophy describes the centre as being a community-based service. Parents and whānau are welcomed and invited to share the unique knowledge they have of their child, and to assist in the development of a meaningful programme of learning. Teachers notice, recognise and respond to children's changing needs as they grow and develop, promoting the individuality of each child. The environment is safe and respectful, recognising the cultural values of both the individual and the community at large.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, staff have undertaken ongoing professional development focused on strengthening te reo and tikanga Māori in teacher practice and the programme experienced by children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The strength of the centre is the shared commitment of all teachers to promoting a warm, inclusive and respectful culture. The centre is an important social and educational point of contact for local families and whānau in this isolated area. Many families have long-standing links with the centre and contribute to its support and the programme opportunities provided.</p><p>Children of all ages experience a settled and welcoming environment. They develop their confidence, skills and a strong sense of belonging. Routines are deliberately inclusive and foster tuakana-teina relationships as part of the extended family atmosphere. Children for whom English is not their first language are encouraged and well supported to feel included and to participate.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are nurtured and experience aroha. Teachers are highly respectful, and interact sensitively with very young children, who are able to play and explore in safe and stimulating environments. They communicate regularly with parents and whānau to ensure routines are consistent with home. Meeting the emotional and physical needs of infants and toddlers is a priority.</p><p>The programme is an appropriate mix of child-initiated and teacher-led activities. Teachers prepare an aesthetically pleasing environment that stimulates children's curiosity, creativity and exploration. Oral language, early literacy skills and mathematical concepts are well integrated into children's learning opportunities. The local environment and history is valued as an important resource to enrich children's experiences. Teachers have strengthened their use of te reo Māori within the daily programme. Children are supported to become confident and competent learners.</p><p>Children benefit from regular interactions with the adjoining school. They attend assemblies, take an active part in many activities and can extend their play onto the school fields. Transitions are well managed and responsive to the needs of children and their families and whānau. Children are well prepared to make a successful transition to school.</p><p>Teachers are skilled at engaging children in learning conversations that extend their interests, thinking and understanding. Children's learning is reflected in attractive wall displays and individual profile books. These books are valued by families and often shared and revisited by children and their families. Children's progress and learning is visible and evident.</p><p>The head teacher has been successful in establishing a purposeful philosophy shared by staff, parents and whānau. She models the values in the philosophy in her own practice while building collaborative leadership in the centre. The appraisal process for 2016 is being developed to meet current legislative requirements. While self review in 2015 was systematic and effective, a next step is for leaders and teachers to make more reference to Ministry of Education on-line resources to support their knowledge about current legislation and to support professional development.</p><p>The management committee has a strong, positive and supportive working relationship with the head teacher. It receives monthly reports on governance matters and oversees communication with the community. There is a need for the committee to clarify its roles and responsibilities for personnel management to ensure appraisal and attestation processes meet current legislative requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Colville Bay Pre-School leaders and teachers should continue to review their strategies for managing a mixed-age setting to ensure older children can experience appropriate challenge and complexity in their learning through play.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Colville Bay Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Colville Bay Pre-School will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>2 November 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
