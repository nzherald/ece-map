</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Glenview Free Kindergarten is one of 12 kindergartens in the South Canterbury Free Kindergarten Association (SCK). It is located in Timaru. The kindergarten provides education and care for children aged from two years to school age. Up to 40 children attend in the mornings and 30 children attend in the afternoon.</p><p>A head teacher and four qualified and certificated teachers are responsible for the daily operations and the teaching programme. A Senior Teacher (ST) supports professional practice in the team. The SCK, including a general manager and Board, oversees the governance and management of the kindergarten.</p><p>The kindergarten has built on the good practices noted in ERO's 2014 report and made good progress against all the identified recommendations. This includes improved appraisal and internal evaluation practices and aligning the kindergarten’s strategic plan with the association's goals.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews in the South Canterbury Free Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers' practices contribute to improved outcomes for children. They are continuing to embed a kindergarten moemoeā/vision and determined valued learning priorities for the children who attend. They want children to develop an 'I can attitude' and to develop a 'joy of learning'. In addition they want children to develop the qualities of, manaakitanga, tikanga-a rua, whakawhanaungatanga, curiosity and inquiry and construction and creativity.</p><p>Teachers are strengthening the use of these values as the basis to plan, assess and evaluate children's learning and teaching practices. As a team they are considering what these values mean for their teaching practices and are making improvements.</p><p>Children's learning is supported by well-resourced environments and they can make choices from a wide range of resources and interesting experiences. Teachers know children well and respond to and extend their interests. They have genuine conversations with children to support their thinking. As a result children are settled and engaged in learning and show a strong sense of belonging. Teachers help children to know and show manaakitanga and to be kaitiakitanga (caretakers of the kindergarten and each other).</p><p>There are useful systems to identify children with diverse learning needs. Detailed plans to support individual children's learning are developed in collaboration with whānau and with external agencies.</p><p>Teachers have developed positive relationships with families and whānau. They welcome parents' contributions to the programme.</p><p>A growing strength in the kindergarten is the way teachers are providing a programme that includes te ao Māori perspectives. The team is considering what educational success as Māori means for tamariki Māori and their whānau. Teachers are finding ways to value and recognise children's cultural heritages.</p><p>Teachers make good use of internal evaluation processes to improve aspects of the programme and to improve outcomes for children. For example, there is now more choice and decision making for children in the afternoon programme and improved curriculum planning, assessment and evaluation practices. The head teacher is effectively leading and supporting teachers to grow their professional practice and share their strengths for the benefit of adults and children.</p><p>The SCK philosophy, vision, goals and systems effectively promote positive outcomes for children. The board, managers and leaders have proactively addressed the recommendations for the association in the October 2014 ERO report.</p><p>There is strong alignment between the SCK strategic priorities and the kindergarten's priorities and plans. The board is well informed about how well each kindergarten is progressing and contributing to the strategic direction of the SCK. However, the board could know more about how well the kindergartens are improving outcomes for children and how well children are achieving in relation to the association’s valued outcomes (purpose).</p><p>The board is strongly focused on improving outcomes for all children, including taking deliberate action to support Māori and Pacific children and children with diverse learning needs in the kindergartens. SCK leaders have developed strong networked relationships with community organisations to support children and their whānau. The next step for the board is to consider their culturally responsive practice as governors and to consult with whānau Māori to inform the future direction of SCK.</p><p>There are effective systems and processes to ensure that regulatory requirements are met within each kindergarten. Relevant professional learning, improved appraisal processes and effective ongoing coaching and mentoring by the senior teachers are building teacher capability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the teachers, with the support of the ST, are to:</p><ul>
<li>consolidate and embed improved curriculum planning, assessment and evaluation practices</li>
<li>clearly defining intended teaching strategies to support children's learning</li>
<li>explore how they might deepen learning partnerships with parents</li>
<li>ensure that the annual plan is evaluated to show the impact of planned actions on outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Glenview Free Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Glenview Free Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>29 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
