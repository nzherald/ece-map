</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Turua/Hauraki Early Learning Centre provides full-day education and care for children from birth to school age in a mixed-age setting. The centre operates under the umbrella of Barnardos Kidstart Childcare. It is situated in the rural village of Turua, near Thames, and is licensed for 36 children including eight under the age of two years. Currently 36 children are on the roll, including seven who identify as Māori.</p><p>The centre philosophy is focused around relationships where children, whānau and teachers have a sense of belonging. The principles of Te Tirity o Waitangi, and the languages, cultures and beliefs which reflect the community are valued.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified significant areas for development and the centre was placed on a two year review cycle. Since the last review the centre has had a complete change of staff. Barnardos Kidstart have also appointed a new regional manager and practice advisor. The service has addressed the regulatory and legislative area identified in the ERO report relating to earthquake safety.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers have a strong commitment to establishing and maintaining reciprocal and positive relationships with children and their families. Effective communication with parents encourages them to take an active role in centre life and provides them with opportunities to have input into the programme. Parents and whānau are well-informed about their children's learning.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years benefit from nurturing respectful interactions. They are able to explore their environment in a safe, secure and calm way. Their communication skills are fostered by teachers' deliberate use of rich language through responsive and engaging interactions. Young children are encouraged to become increasingly knowledgeable and capable self-managing learners.</p><p>Teachers prepare a well-designed learning environment. The mixed-age learning spaces encourage independence and enables children to learn alongside each other at their own pace. Children's learning is supported by a stimulating, engaging and well-resourced environment. All areas of play are visible and accessible to children. A feature of the learning environment is the deliberate use of natural resources.</p><p>The curriculum is well designed to reflect a play-based approach to learning. There is a strong emphasis on child-directed learning experiences that promote social competence and independence. Literacy and numeracy learning is well-embedded into children's play. Excursions into the community are well utilised as additional learning experiences. The Ngahere Bush learning programme effectively promotes the outside environment as a rich learning experience. Children experience a curriculum where they are listened to and encouraged to become confident and successful learners and explorers. To further improve planning and assessment, teachers need to be more intentional when planning for children interests.</p><p>Teachers are committed to providing children with experiences and opportunities to learn about te ao Māori. Tikanga and te reo practices such as waiata, karakia and pōwhiri are integrated into the programme. Children are increasingly building their knowledge and understanding of the unique bi-cultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>Teachers are respectful and responsive to children's wellbeing and belonging. Distributed leadership empowers teachers to take responsibility and lead aspects of centre operations. Leaders have established a culture in which children are first and foremost valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning. Effective ways of working between leaders and teachers ensure children are respected and affirmed as confident explorers.</p><p>The services philosophy, vision, goals and policies have been established to promote positive outcomes for children. There is a commitment to improvement through ongoing self review. Internal evaluation has been effective at governance level including regular review of policies and operational procedures. Appraisal systems and processes have been developed that guide teacher practice and goal setting. A priority for ongoing development is for teachers and leaders to continue the implementation and alignment of appraisal and teachers' reflective practice.</p><p>Barnardos Kidstart have developed useful quality-assurance systems that support ongoing centre improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and ERO agree that the important next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further implement the organisations current appraisal process to include teacher’s self-assessment, manager feedback and formal observations to continue to build teacher capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement centre-wide professional learning and development about programme planning and assessment to support teachers to effectively set goals, identify children’s learning outcomes and show progress of their learning over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that managers and leaders access external professional learning and development to address the key next steps in this report in relation to programme planning and assessment.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Turua/Hauraki Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Barnardos KidStart Childcare - Turua/Hauraki Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>27 September 2017</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
