</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rachel Reynolds Kindergarten is one of 24 kindergartens operating under the Dunedin Kindergarten Association (DK). It is located in South Dunedin and provides programmes for up to 45 children from 8:30 in the morning to 2:30 in the afternoon. Children may attend all or part of the day as their family chooses. The group size is kept to 30 children at the most with five adults usually present. This includes three experienced, qualified teachers who have worked together for a long time, and two teacher aides.</p><p>Rachel Reynolds Kindergarten has a long history of providing care and education for children (over 100 years). Children come from diverse social and cultural backgrounds.</p><p>Teachers aim to provide equitable opportunities for children to learn and grow at their own pace. They value cultural diversity and provide a caring, safe, happy, non-judgemental place for children and their families. Teachers have stated that their desired outcomes are for children to:</p><ul>
<li>be confident, competent learners</li>
<li>learn about being healthy in mind, body and spirit</li>
<li>learn about New Zealand’s bicultural heritage</li>
<li>learn to respect others</li>
<li>learn to express themselves.</li>
</ul><p>The team has made good progress in addressing the recommendations from the 2012 ERO review.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 24 reviews in the DK.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families benefit from the very strong pastoral care provided by the head teacher and teachers. For example, the kindergarten provides morning tea for all children and termly barbeques for families at no cost. Teachers have created and model an inclusive and non-judgemental environment. Children also show these attributes. There is a calm, inviting and welcoming atmosphere. Teachers have earned parents’ trust and given them confidence to have their children attend regularly. The experienced team of teachers work well together to provide stability and continuity for children.</p><p>Teachers provide a wide range of experiences so that all children are appropriately challenged. Teachers plan specifically for children under three years as well as for the older age group.</p><p>Planning is based on children’s interests and includes a focus on early literacy and numeracy, in particular oral language development, gardening, dramatic play and music. Including a Māori dimension within the daily programme and life of the kindergarten is a strength, along with a growing awareness of the cultures of Pacific children. There is deliberate planning for this.</p><p>Teachers are particularly aware of children’s needs and Individual children are planned for in detail. Profile books are attractive records of children’s learning and progress throughout their kindergarten journey. Stories show teachers respond to what parents have shared about their children and in some cases what parents want for their children’s learning.</p><p>The outdoor area is stimulating and encourages children to explore and play. There is a deliberate use of natural resources to create a challenging and attractive environment. Indoors, children enjoy a wide variety of interesting materials and experiences. Skilled teachers support children’s developing oral language and model positive interactions and social skills for children. Digital technology is helping to extend children’s learning. Teachers have developed a booklet to support children and their families as they move on to school. Children are learning to manage their play and routines independently. Teachers acknowledge that this could be extended further.</p><p>The teachers follow a useful process of self review. They regularly reflect on their practices and make changes to what they are doing so that children benefit. Termly evaluations, however, would be more useful if they were less descriptive and more critical about how well teaching and programmes were achieving the desired outcomes.</p><p>The vision of the DK is to provide excellence in early childhood education for all children. The DK is governed by a board and managed by a long-serving general manager. The kindergarten teachers told ERO they appreciated the support they receive from the association and the advice and guidance of the senior teachers. </p><p>The board, general manager and senior teachers:</p><ul>
<li>provide appropriate opportunities for parents and staff to contribute their ideas about matters in the association</li>
<li>are responsive to identified needs of children and families within the association and provide funding and support to enable these to be met</li>
<li>have developed a useful framework to guide their work</li>
<li>take all reasonable steps to ensure safe environments for children, teachers and other staff</li>
<li>maintain their professional learning and provide ongoing professional learning for teachers in the association.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Kindergarten documents state that it is highly important for children to develop strong oral language. If this was at the forefront of planning, included in teachers’ appraisal goals and made more visible within the kindergarten for teachers and parents, the teaching and learning would be even more focused to ensure this outcome is met.</p><p>When next reviewing the philosophy, teachers should state more clearly what the most valued learning priorities are for children at this place. The strategic plan, self review, appraisal goals and professional development should then be aligned with these. This would enable teachers to evaluate more efficiently how well they are meeting their expectations for children’s learning.</p><p>Next steps for the board, with the support of the general manger and senior teachers, are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to define what excellence in education looks like in the DK</li>
<li>further develop strategic planning to better show future goals and priorities and how these will be achieved in the association and in the kindergartens</li>
<li>ensure that the reports they receive show how well the association's vision and goals are met, are evaluative and inform future planning</li>
<li>continue to strengthen the appraisal process and be assured that appraisals are rigorous and consistent throughout the kindergartens.</li>
</ul><p>With the appointment of a new senior teacher, it is timely for the board and general manager to review the role of the senior teachers and strengthen systems to ensure consistent, high-quality practice across all kindergartens within the association.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rachel Reynolds Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rachel Reynolds Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>22 December 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><p>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</p><p>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</p><p>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</p><p>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
