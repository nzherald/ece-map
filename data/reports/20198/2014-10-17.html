</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Prodigy Centre Greenhithe caters for children from birth to school age. The service operates under the umbrella of the Prodigy group which continues to provide operational systems for its centres, including a policy and budget framework.</p><p>The service offers all day and sessional options. It is the only Prodigy centre which caters for infants and toddlers. Although there is a specific area for these children, it does not have easy access for children to a suitable outdoor environment.</p><p>A new teacher registration support leader is beginning to support teacher development across the Prodigy centres. The centre manager is now working more closely with two other centre managers to share ideas and make positive changes.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review, the centre’s roll has fluctuated. Several areas for development and review outlined in the 2011 report have been addressed. Further work is required to increase the quality of strategic and annual planning, self review and teacher performance management processes. Staff continue to lack access to a designated, appropriate space to be apart from children during their breaks or for private meetings with parents. This must be addressed by the service owner.</p><p>The centre is currently operating on a transitional licence from the Ministry of Education (MOE). The service provider has until November 2014 to provide evidence that the centre complies with the <em>Resource Management Act 1991.</em></p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers have coped very well with the recent influx of new children. Children and their families are warmly welcomed and children settle in well as they arrive. They are well supported to develop social skills and independence within the centre’s home-like environment. Older children are confident and capable learners who communicate freely with adults.</p><p>Teachers have sustained good quality teaching practices and are respectful towards children. Teachers of the older children promote children’s engagement and learning well, noticing and responding to their interests. The attractive indoor environment for these children includes useful displays of their learning and teachers’ programme planning. Some literacy and numeracy activities, and some aspects of te ao Māori, are incorporated into the programme in meaningful ways. The bicultural curriculum is, however, an area for further professional development.</p><p>Younger infants and toddlers experience a quiet, calm environment. Caring teachers use flexible routines to cater effectively for their wellbeing. Siblings can spend time with younger children, reinforcing the family feel of the service.</p><p>The physical environment for the younger children could benefit from further development to develop their sense of belonging and their opportunities to gain increased motor skills. Improving access to the outdoor environment should be a next step. To further promote positive outcomes for infants and toddlers, teachers could also review how well their current practices align with indicators of effective teaching practice.</p><p>Teachers' individual assessments of children are well analysed and provide parents with good records of their children’s experiences. Teachers are intent on promoting learning partnerships with families. They have established positive relationships and good communication with families. Teachers are well placed to increase the documentation about their responses to parent contributions.</p><p>Teachers have not always been annually appraised and performance management systems do not yet have good links between appraisal, and teacher registration and attestation requirements. Centre leaders should ensure that all teachers have easy access to the range of professional development opportunities needed to meet corporate goals and individual learning needs.</p><p>Self review is developing. A new system that is more closely linked to positive outcomes for children is now being trialled. Centre leaders agree that a more specific, measurable and well structured annual plan would promote further self review and ongoing centre improvement. Such a plan should be supported at an organisational level and should include indicators of success and quality.</p><p>Centre leaders are enthusiastic and are beginning to work collaboratively to improve outcomes for children. As centre leaders across the Prodigy group work more closely together, this centre is likely to be better placed to achieve the next stage of its development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO recommends that programme planning throughout the centre could now place an increased focus on promoting individual children’s learning and reflecting their individual emerging interests.</p><p>ERO and centre managers also agree that teachers could strengthen their teaching by developing a shared understanding of effective practices, using more strategies to extend children’s thinking and providing more high quality learning experiences in the outdoor area.</p><p>ERO recommends that the service provider enhance the service by developing good quality, relevant and measurable plans that show how the centre’s needs and the compliance matters outlined below will be met.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Prodigy Centre - Greenhithe completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the review ERO identified several areas of non-compliance. In order to address these, the service provider must ensure there is:</p><ul>
<li>a private, appropriate space for adults working at the service</li>
<li>an effective means of maintaining room temperature in sleep areas</li>
<li>an effective system of regular appraisal</li>
<li>a suitable budget to improve the service premises, and a more specific annual plan to address areas for improvement.</li>

Education Act, 1989.</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Prodigy Centre - Greenhithe will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>17 October 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
