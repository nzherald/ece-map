</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Amanda’s Homebased ECE is a well established service with educators located across Auckland. The service includes three networks, each with different characteristics. This network is a Quality Funded service and features a team of experienced educators who operate their own playgroup in South Auckland. There are currently 27 children enrolled, including eight under two years of age. Approximately 20 percent of the children have Māori heritage. Another 20 percent are of Middle Eastern descent.</p><p>The service has three Educational Team Leaders (ETLs) who are registered teachers. They provide support and guidance for educators across the three networks. The owner has responsibility for the management of the service.</p><p>Since the 2008 ERO review Amanda’s Homebased ECE has undergone significant change. Its administration has relocated from central to west Auckland, two of the ETLs are new appointments and there have been changes in Ministry of Education funding. The service was relicensed in 2013 and has needed to meet new licensing requirements and expectations.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s learning programmes are underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Their learning records show that they engage in varied programmes. Educators provide a range of opportunities for children in homes and in the community, including playgroup and group excursions. Their experiences include early literacy and opportunities to explore creative and manipulative materials. Children build relationships with others and participate in physical and musical activities.</p><p>Children are well supported to settle into educators’ homes and to transition to school. ETLs monitor how well infants and toddlers adapt and help educators to establish daily diaries that record children’s routines and play interests. ETLs write affirming reports about children’s holistic development that provide very good information to support their entry into school. They encourage educators to provide opportunities for all children to experience their language and culture.</p><p>Training opportunities have had a positive impact on educators’ practice. This professional development has helped them to change their learning environments and more confidently engage in discussions with parents. ETLs model effective teaching strategies at playgroups and encourage educators to experiment with new ideas. The playgroups also enable ETLs to work with children as a group and to enhance their relationships with educators and families who use the service.</p><p>The owner and ETLs work as a team and are committed to ongoing improvement. ETLs make regular home visits to the educators and have recently improved the quality of their monthly reports about children as a result of reflective self review. The recent introduction of an electronic systems management tool has enabled them to better support educators with assessing children’s learning. This tool has also increased parents’ involvement in their children’s learning.</p><p>A new appraisal system for ETLs has been implemented. The owner agrees this process could be developed further to ensure ETLs set measurable goals and regularly evaluate their own progress. ETLs also want to strengthen their bicultural practices.</p><p>The owner shares management responsibilities with the ETLs. They engage in ongoing discussions about priorities for the service and their vision to include new opportunities for diverse communities. This informal approach does not always support a clear direction for the service. The owner and ETLs recognise that they should now redefine the leadership structure and better document expectations. This should help them to sustain the service’s operations more effectively over time.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service provider and ETLs agree that key next steps for improving the service include:</p><ul>
<li>increasing the extent to which programmes reflect the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand</li>
<li>improving documented systems to better support ETL practice in relation to their coaching roles, playgroup planning, parent contact and educator visit records</li>
<li>updating the strategic plan to reflect current priorities, set long-term direction and make provision for the regular evaluation of strategic goals</li>
<li>developing systems and a framework for the team to undertake planned, strategic self review.</li>
</ul><p>The owner and ETLs recognise they should urgently implement documented systems for the effective monitoring of health and safety regulatory requirements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Amanda's Homebased ECE completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practices the service should:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen its risk management processes for excursions</li>
<li>ensure that all teacher registrations and police vets are renewed in a timely manner</li>
<li>adjust privacy practices to reflect changes in staffing, assessment tools and documentation</li>
<li>urgently implement documented systems for the effective monitoring of health and safety regulatory requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Amanda's Homebased ECE will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>8 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
