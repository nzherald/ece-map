</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Greenwood Kindergarten is part of the Nelson Tasman Kindergarten Association (NTKA). The kindergarten provides for the education and care of up to 45 children, aged from two-to-five years, from a diverse community. The association offers up to 30 free hours to support children's participation in early childhood education. It also provides a range of external expertise to help all children succeed in their learning. This includes te ao Māori expertise, teacher aides, a speech-language therapist, whānau support and parent education opportunities.</p><p>The head teacher and teaching team are responsible for daily operations and the teaching programme. All teachers are fully qualified. A teacher aide provides support for the children and teachers to help meet identified areas of need. An active parent committee leads fundraising initiatives to support ongoing resourcing, special outings and improvements to the kindergarten. The kindergarten provides several community links. This includes a weekly baby playgroup that is supported by the teachers and community agencies.</p><p>The NTKA, including a Chief Executive Officer and board, is responsible for the governance of the kindergarten. A team of senior education advisors (SEA) oversee and support the professional practice of the teaching team.</p><p>The kindergarten has made steady progress with the recommendations identified in ERO’s 2013 report. This includes practices to support children's emotional and social learning, and improving assessment and evaluation processes.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the NTKA.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers foster positive, inclusive, respectful relationships with children, parents and whānau. They have strong links with community groups and external expertise to help support the wellbeing of children and families. Transitions into the kindergarten and onto school are carefully considered and personalised to the needs of the child and each family, to support a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy reflects the teaching team's shared beliefs and caring ways of working with children. Bicultural practices that help all children to know about the dual heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand are integrated into the programme. Environmentally sustainable practices and links to the natural world are integrated within a curriculum that is underpinned by Te Whāriki, the early childhood curriculum, and teaches children to care for and learn more about their environment.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well supported through sensitive interactions and strong links to the community. Teachers work collaboratively with parents and external expertise to develop an individualised approach to children's learning and wellbeing. The kindergarten association provides a range of external expertise to help all children succeed in their learning. This includes te ao Māori expertise, teacher aides, a speech-language therapist, whānau support and parent education.</p><p>Children benefit from an unhurried, child-centred, localised curriculum that is responsive to their interests, strengths and capabilities. Teachers document children's involvement in a wide range of experiences that encourage them to settle well and engage in learning through play. The contributions and involvement of parents, whānau and community enrich the curriculum provided for children within and beyond the kindergarten.</p><p>Leaders and teachers work to enable equitable outcomes for all children. Collaborative, effective leadership ensures a culture in which children are first and foremost valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning.</p><p>Managers and leaders have proactively addressed ERO’s recommendations for the association identified in previous reports. There is strong alignment between the NTKA strategic priorities and each kindergarten’s priorities and plans.</p><p>The board is well informed about outcomes from association-wide strategic reviews and the progress being made to achieve strategic goals. The board and association managers are taking deliberate action to support Māori and Pacific children and children with diverse learning needs. NTKA leaders have developed strong, networked relationships with community organisations to support children and their whānau.</p><p>There are effective systems and processes to ensure that regulatory requirements are met. Relevant professional learning opportunities, improved teacher appraisal processes and effective ongoing coaching and mentoring by the education advisors are building leadership and teacher capability within the kindergartens.</p><p>A next step for association leaders and managers is to improve their planning to support the achievement of the board’s strategic objectives. This includes ensuring that reporting is evaluative and focuses on outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the association board are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>explore ways to know more about how well children are achieving in relation to the association’s valued outcomes (vision and philosophy)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate the extent of improved outcomes for all children, and use these findings to inform decision making and the future direction of the association.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Greenwood Kindergarten’s teaching team has identified, and ERO's evaluation has confirmed, that the key next steps for this kindergarten are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>refine and clearly express the kindergarten’s valued outcomes for children in implementing a localised curriculum, and in assessment and planning processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen internal evaluation and annual planning processes to include a focus on valued outcomes for children, and the impact of kindergarten and teaching practices on these outcomes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Greenwood Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Greenwood Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>13 September 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
