</table><p>The centre is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Moa Kids Community Early Learning Inc. is a not-for-profit, community-owned, education and care service. The centre is located in a community reserve in Redcliffs. The centre is governed and managed by an elected governance committee, and a centre manager.</p><p>Moa Kids is licensed to provide care and education for up to 50 children, including 10 children under two years old. The centre has a preschool room and a nursery. Both areas have separate outside play spaces. A centre manager oversees the centre and is supported by a head teacher who manages the curriculum, nursery and preschool. All staff are registered and qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>Since the previous 2015 ERO review there has been a restructured leadership, with new governance committee members and chair. Significant improvements have been made to centre programme and practices. There has been a steady increase in the centre roll and staffing.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have strengthened programme assessment and planning. They have refined and embedded new internal evaluation/self-review processes. Internal evaluation is now well established. The governance committee and leaders have effectively addressed the areas for improvement and noncompliance identified in the 2015 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A wide range of choices and a rich learning environment provide children with many opportunities to lead their own learning. A play-based approach enables children to further extend their learning through creativity. Bi-culturalism is evident and successfully integrated in curriculum programmes. Teachers foster an inclusive culture, value children's opinions and see children as capable, confident learners.</p><p>Positive relationships with children and their parents are highly evident across the centre. Centre engagement with parents and whānau is very well promoted and communication is regular and informative.</p><p>Teachers take care in listening to children’s ideas and promote an environment of mutual trust. Individualised learning, processes and practices value each child. Project based learning encourages exploration and provides extended opportunities for sustained engagement with learning. Children are well supported in transitions within the centre.</p><p>The nursery has a small group size and the ratios promote and support responsive caregiving. Infants experience a calm, nurturing environment and interactions with teachers. Infants are invited in to learning and their needs and interests drive the programmes. The teachers move at the infants' pace and there is a strong focus on oral language and whole-child development.</p><p>The governance committee, leadership and teachers have a clear vision, shared values and philosophy for children's learning and wellbeing. This is well reflected in centre programmes and practices. The philosophy focuses on developing children's development and wellbeing to enable them to become confident and competent lifelong learners. Community engagement is a sustained characteristic of the centre philosophy which is strongly shared by the governance committee, leaders, staff and community.</p><p>Leadership maintain an effective oversight of the quality of assessment and planning. Teachers' planning identifies children's learning needs and goals and the strategies teachers use to monitor children's progress. Teachers follow an improved process for assessment and planning.</p><p>Centre leaders have managed a range of complex changes across the centre very well. They are strongly focused on:</p><ul>
<li>prioritising relationships with the community, parents and whānau to promote opportunities for children to be engaged and connected to their wider community</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen staff capability and consistency of practice</li>
<li>increased collaboration, leading to a strengthened team culture</li>
<li>improving internal evaluation/self-review practices which has led to changes that promote positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>There are positive relationships between the governance committee, leadership and staff. The governance committee is strategically focused on resourcing and decision making that best supports children. This includes a wide range of professional development opportunities for staff. The committee is dedicated to ensuring a strong financial basis for centre operations. Their commitment to the community is very evident.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre has clearly identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps to further improve outcomes for children are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>consolidate, strengthen and embed recent improvements and initiatives</li>
<li>build consistency in assessment and planning processes</li>
<li>build evaluation capability across the centre.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Moa Kids Community Early Learning Centre Inc completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Moa Kids Community Early Learning Centre Inc will be in four years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>22 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
