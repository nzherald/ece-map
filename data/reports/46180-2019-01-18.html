</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Timaru Christian Preschool is a privately owned centre that provides all day education and care for up to 45 children over the age of two years. The centre is located within the Timaru Christian School grounds. There have been some outdoor property developments, including the development of bush, orchard and vegetable areas.</p><p>Since the 2015 ERO review, there have been a number of staff changes. The centre supervisor and most teachers are qualified early childhood teachers. The supervisor has oversight of the day-to-day running of the centre and works collaboratively with the owners to oversee centre operations.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified that this centre required further development, especially in areas related to governance and management. Since this report, the owners, supervisor and teachers have received significant external professional development and support and made good progress against ERO's recommendations. Improvements are evident in strategic and annual planning, governance and management and appraisal practices and in the quality of assessment and planning for individual children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy, which has a strong emphasis on family and community, is evident in the programme. Teachers work to ensure the programme is underpinned by Te Whāriki, The Early Childhood Curriculum, and the special Christian character. There is a strong focus on children's spiritual, physical, social and emotional development.</p><p>Children experience caring, respectful relationships with each other and with their teachers. These relationships strongly support their sense of belonging and wellbeing. Teachers use specific approaches to welcome, involve and support children and their families, especially those from different cultural backgrounds. Teachers provide an inclusive environment, where children's cultural backgrounds are celebrated.</p><p>Children benefit from a wide range of activities and inviting resources. The environment is thoughtfully presented and well used to extend children's play, further enriching their learning experiences and exploration. Quiet areas have been planned for children to sit and read. Children's independence, responsibility and self-help skills are encouraged and supported by their teachers within familiar routines. A spacious outdoor area fosters physical challenges, creative and dramatic play. Children have opportunities to learn about respect for creation and care for the environment through planting, caring and preparation of the vegetables, herbs and fruit grown at the centre.</p><p>Professional development has resulted in improved planning and assessment systems for individual children. Planning and assessment now has a focus on learning and identifying learning progressions, over a period of time. The introduction of an online tool to strengthen communication enables parents to receive and respond regularly to information shared about their children's outcomes in the programme.</p><p>The owners and centre supervisor have significantly strengthened management and governance documents and practices. There are clearer roles and responsibilities, with effective collaboration and appropriate reporting between the owners and centre supervisor. There are well-considered strategic goals, strategic and annual planning systems, and a sound policy and procedure framework.</p><p>Effective practices are in place that contribute to ongoing centre improvements. Regular internal evaluation and sound appraisal processes enable teachers to identify improvements needed and to enhance children's experiences at the centre. Leaders ensure that teachers are provided with relevant professional development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre leaders agree that the next steps are to strengthen aspects of recently improved systems and practices. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing the appraisal process to meet Education Council requirements to include two planned observations and an annual summary report attesting that standards have been met</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving the internal evaluation process, to deepen all teachers' understandings and participation, including the use of evaluative questions and wider stakeholder voice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making children's home language, cultural identity, and their parents' aspirations more explicit in children's assessment and planning records</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making teaching strategies and evaluation more visible in planning and assessment, particularly for groups.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Timaru Christian Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><ul>
<li>
<p>review personnel policy and procedures to align to best practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Timaru Christian Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p>18 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
