</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Reo Rarotonga Bilingual Early Childhood Centre is a Cook Island Māori community-based punanga reo in East Tamaki, Auckland. It provides education and care for children from birth to five years of age. The punanga is licensed for 30 children, including up to five children under the age of two years. The centre is located on the grounds of the Kuki Airani Angaanga Tupuna (KAAT) Trust. There is a low turnover of staff. Well coordinated professional support for staff to undertake training has resulted in more staff with qualifications.</p><p>The centre has a strong philosophy of providing children with a culturally appropriate learning environment that incorporates Kuki Airani values in practice. Cook Island Māori language, culture and identity are valued through the importance placed on tangata (people), punanga (language) and pirianga (relationships).</p><p>The centre is governed by a board of governors of the KAAT Trust, and is managed by a team led by an early childhood services manager. A services supervisor oversees the daily operations of the centre, and works closely with the early childhood services manager who provides leadership and guidance on the strategic direction of the centre and the quality of the curriculum.</p><p>ERO's 2013 review findings identified several areas for centre improvement. These included the quality of self-review, and leadership and management systems and processes. Since the 2013 review, the board and staff have made significant progress in addressing these and other recommendations. There is now a formal internal review process that is linked to strategic outcomes, and a process to build leadership capacity in the centre. Leaders have also implemented an improved administration system to support leaders identify areas of progress and areas for further improvement.</p><p>The significant changes that are noted in this report have provided teachers with clearer direction and opportunity to improve the programme to bring about increasingly positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy a sense of belonging to the punanga. They are happy, settled and engaged in learning through play. They demonstrate respect for each other and for the environment as they make choices about their learning.</p><p>Children enjoy the freedom of choosing their play activities and some play independently. Children under two enjoy mixing with older children and respond positively to the nurturing that comes from these tuakana/teina relationships.</p><p>Children understand centre routines well and learn independence by using their self-help skills. They enjoy the many opportunities for physical exercise and excursions. Children demonstrate good understanding of heathy eating practices.</p><p>The environment strongly promotes the Cook Island Māori language, culture and identity with a focus on bicultural partnership with Māori. Teachers who are fluent in Cook Island Māori language actively support colleagues to use the language incidentally in their interactions with children.</p><p>The environment also encourages children to have fun learning through play. A new purpose-built facility is due to open during 2016. This will replace the present environment, which is in a poor state.</p><p>Teachers interact warmly with children to support their play. They relate to families and know the children well. Teachers plan collaboratively to extend children's group experiences. They work well together as a team to promote the values of the punanga. The programme promotes the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. It is based on children's interests and strengths and promotes exploration and creativity. Excursions highlight events and the cultural curriculum. Teachers consistently record children's learning and experiences in children's portfolios.</p><p>Many of the staff are long serving and have built good relationships with parents and families. There are good leadership opportunities for staff. They are involved in regular professional conversations and are well supported to implement the centre philosophy. Teachers’ appraisal processes provide opportunities for staff to identify meaningful goals. Leaders encourage teachers to attend professional development and consolidate their skills and expertise.</p><p>A rigorous self-review process helps managers and teachers to make improvements to the programme and their practice. Leaders encourage teachers to become more evaluative and conduct meaningful reviews. A good induction process helps staff to develop expertise at their pace and build their capacity as teachers. They work collaboratively to make decisions and evaluate the programme for children.</p><p>Parents have opportunities to contribute to the programme and to help staff review systems and practices. Their views and ideas are valued and they are encouraged to contribute to the life and operations of the centre in several ways. Many parents utilise their skills and expertise to help with the operational running of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The board and management team have identified the following appropriate next steps. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening and embedding effective practices to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to support staff to be more evaluative and continuing to embed the existing selfreview process.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The KAAT Trust members could also review how effective their collaborative processes are for working with the Early Childhood Services department.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Reo Rarotonga Bi-Lingual E C Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Reo Rarotonga Bi-Lingual E C Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>17 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
