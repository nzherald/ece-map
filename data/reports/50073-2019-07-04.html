</table><p>Tuatara Kids Tuakana is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tuatara Kids Tuakana Early Learning Centre is a privately owned and operated centre located in Miramar, Wellington. It is licenced for 28 children, including six children up to two years of age. At the time of this review, three of the children enrolled identified as Māori.</p><p>Since the April 2017 ERO report, the centre has had changes of ownership, management and staff. A new centre director and team leader were appointed after a restructure in early 2018. Two thirds of the multicultural teaching staff are qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>The centre philosophy emphasises the importance of partnership, respect and exploration. The service supports a diverse community of learners.</p><p>Children under two are catered for through a designated indoor space, as well as being able to access the areas available to older children.</p><p>The April 2016 ERO report identified assessment planning and evaluation, strengthening bicultural practices and improving appraisal as key next steps for improvement. Very good progress has been made with developing and implementing the bicultural curriculum with some success made in addressing the other key areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A high level of commitment to bicultural practice is apparent. Teachers value te reo Māori and effectively integrate this into the programme. Children confidently respond and use Māori words and demonstrate their familiarity with the centre waiata, pepeha and whakatauki. They enjoy the leadership opportunities that kotahitanga (mat) time presents.</p><p>Teachers are aware of and respond to the languages, cultures and identities of all children. The environment includes a wide range of natural materials and meaningful cultural artefacts that reflect the cultural backgrounds and languages of children and their families and whānau. They view each family and its knowledge of their child as an integral part of the service’s learning community.</p><p>Positive relationships are developed with infants and toddlers and their families. They develop sensitive and responsive relationships with children. Interactions are warm and affirming. Well established routines provide a sense of security.</p><p>Children’s language development is effectively fostered. Their talk is encouraged, accepted and respected. Children are empowered to take increased responsibility for the wellbeing of themselves and others. Literacy and mathematics are highly valued and well integrated into the curriculum.</p><p>Transitions to school are supported by useful communication with schools in the Kāhui Ako. Time is given to support children through the transition process. A range of professional development (PD) has supported the service to develop their practices.</p><p>Teachers are increasingly working with the goals and strands of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Greater use of PD should support improved understanding and increase the focus on the curriculum learning outcomes. Staff have accessed and shared PD around engaging with Pacific learners using <em>Tapasā - Cultural Competencies Framework for Teachers of Pacific Learners.</em></p><p>Curriculum design is adapted as the needs and ages of children in the centre change. Ongoing observation of children in everyday activities builds a picture of what children know, understand, feel, are interested in, and can do. These observations contribute to learning stories shared digitally and in portfolios. Assessment practices are used to identify children’s learning with portfolios proving a useful tool to gain parent and whānau feedback about each child’s developing interests. Portfolios show children's participation in the daily programme and at times demonstrate the increasing complexity of children’s learning. These records are available to the children and parents so that they can revisit aspirations, learning progress and share their learning with others.</p><p>The strategic plan usefully lists five key goals. These centre priorities are accompanied by well-defined performance indicators. The annual plan is a detailed calendar of events. Wording in policies should be reviewed to reflect current terminology.</p><p>With changes of centre governance and management, appraisal processes have been given a lesser priority and were not completed in 2017 and 2018. Appraisal is well underway in 2019 with individual staff goals established, observations and an inquiry focus to further develop teaching. Leaders are aware of the importance of completing end of year summaries for appraisal.</p><p>Internal evaluation needs strengthening to ensure shared understandings and consistent implementation of each stage of the evaluation process. Building staff capability should assist decision making to improve outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further strengthen assessment and planning processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue professional development for <em>Te Whāriki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that staff appraisal is fully implemented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tuatara Kids Tuakana completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance in governance and management. The service provider must:</p><ul>
<li>ensure that staff appraisal is fully implemented each year for every employee.<br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Services 2008, GMA7.]</em></li>
</ul><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>4 July 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
