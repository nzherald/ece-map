</table><p>Annabel’s Educare Avonhead Ltd is <em>very well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews of the Annabel’s Educare Ltd organisation.</p><p>Annabel’s Educare Avonhead Ltd is owned and operated by Annabel’s Educare Ltd. The centre caters for 79 children from birth to five years of age, in four learning areas. The nursery children are cared for in two separate rooms and share an outdoor area. The preschool children also have two classrooms and share an outdoor area. Children move freely between the classrooms and their outdoor area.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy incorporates the Māori values of manaakitanga (respectful, caring interactions), whanaungatanga (family-like relationships) and kotahitanga (teaching and learning together). Almost all of the staff including the licensee and area manager, are registered early childhood teachers. Many of these teachers have worked at Annabel’s for a number of years.</p><p>Annabel’s management structure and the high level of support that managers provide is helping teachers to provide high quality education and care for children at the centre. The managers have made good use of the 2011 ERO report to further improve self review and assessment practices to enhance learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well supported in their learning by teachers who take a special interest in each child. Teachers listen and ask good questions to help children reason, problem solve and further develop their knowledge and understanding. Children and teachers enjoy learning and making new discoveries together.</p><p>Infants and toddlers in the nursery are happy and settled. Key teachers form close relationships with the child and his/her family. Routines are flexible and managed in ways that respect children and their growing independence. Teachers know the children well and encourage them to actively explore and make sense of new experiences.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy closely reflects the curriculum and the ways that adults and children work and support each other. The Māori values that underpin the philosophy are strongly evident in the positive, respectful interactions between children and their teachers.</p><p>Children and families from other cultures are well supported in the centre, and when they move on to school. Teachers are familiar with the different cultures and help families settle into the wider community. The celebration of cultural events is an important part of the centre programme. Children show pride in their own culture and enjoy sharing it with others. Children with special needs participate in all aspects of the programme. Their goals are carefully monitored in consultation with their parents.</p><p>Teachers clearly identify children’s learning, their progress and next steps. Parents and children regularly comment on the learning and make close links between home and centre experiences.</p><p>Teachers are developing a good understanding of self review. They are beginning to make effective use of planned reviews that support improvements to the programme and the quality of learning and teaching.</p><p>The managers provide effective leadership for the organisation and support for the centre’s curriculum leader. Teachers are encouraged and well supported to continue to develop their skills and knowledge. They take an active role in achieving the organisation’s vision for high quality education and care.</p><p>The organisation has a well developed management framework that effectively guides the operation of the centre. The managers and teachers have recently developed key values and principles for the organisation. These values and beliefs are being linked to all aspects of centre operations to help to ensure Annabel’s high expectations for the centres are sustained and promoted by all staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The managers and curriculum leader agree that they need to :</p><ul>
<li>continuing to extend and record the way teachers use their skills and knowledge to promote children’s learning</li>
<li>completing planned self reviews and evaluate how well the changes are improving learning and teaching</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen strategic planning so that it more clearly shows links to annual plans, self review and staff appraisal goals.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Annabel's Educare Avonhead Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Annabel's Educare Avonhead Ltd will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell<br> National Manager Review Services<br> Southern Region</p><p>19 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><div>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
