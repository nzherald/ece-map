</table><p>Kidz Rock Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidz Rock Early Learning Centre is a privately-owned education and care service situated in Rotorua. The service operates between 7.30am and 5.30pm, Monday to Friday. It is licensed for up to 30 children from birth to school age including eight under two years of age, in a mixed age-group setting. Currently 17 children are enrolled of whom 11 identify as Māori and some from other cultures.</p><p>The centre owner and manager continue to work together to provide governance and management. Three of the five teachers are fully qualified. The centre philosophy is focused on providing an environment that fosters and enhances each child’s individual strengths and interests through a child-initiated programme.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. Since the previous ERO review in June 2016 teachers have revised aspects of assessment, appraisal and self review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Strong reciprocal relationships based on respect and trust among teachers, children, and whānau are evident. Leaders and teachers work collaboratively in a culture where children are valued and celebrated. Teaching is responsive to the interests and needs of children that is contributing to positive learning outcomes.</p><p>Teachers implement a culturally responsive approach to children and whānau. Bicultural practices are naturally integrated into the programme. There is a commitment to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. Children's language, culture and identity are valued and affirmed. Teachers take time to listen, ask open questions, and actively promote tuākana-teina practices. Teachers maintain a calm, slow pace in which children have time and space to lead their own learning.</p><p>Children up to the age of two are well nurtured and cared for. Teachers know their home routines well and incorporate them into the programme. Positive interactions between teachers and children foster a sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>The curriculum responds well to children's interests and needs. A wide range of learning experiences are promoted. Assessment highlights children's identity as successful learners. Children's learning experiences are reflected in their portfolios, are easily accessed, and shared with their whānau. The learning environment encourages exploration and discovery that is meaningful and enjoyable.</p><p>A shared philosophy and vision provide a clear direction for the centre. Parents and whānau have opportunities to contribute to the service. Self review supports ongoing centre improvement. Effective management systems and practices are in place. Teachers are developing reflective practices through a teaching as inquiry approach.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for teachers and leasers are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment practices to identify and reflect complexities of children's learning in individual portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop self review processes that align to the centre's strategic plan and focuses on positive outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidz Rock Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>27 November 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="[sitetree_link,id=]"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
