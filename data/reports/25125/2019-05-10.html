</table><p>Te Ao Hou Community Childcare Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Ao Hou Community Childcare Centre is a community-based service that has served the Point England community for almost 30 years. It is licensed to provide full-day education and care for up to 28 children, including up to five under two years of age. Most children have Pacific or Māori heritage.</p><p>The centre continues to operate from a modified city council building adjacent to Point England School and is awaiting the renewal of its lease. It is governed by the management committee of an incorporated society and charitable trust. A supervisor and three senior teachers lead programmes for children. These four registered teachers have worked as a team for a long period of time. Teachers reflect the cultural and linguistic diversity of the centre community.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is based on the Māori concept of Te Whare Tapa Whā, the holistic development and wellbeing of the child. The philosophy is linked to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and includes a strong commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi.</p><p>In 2015 ERO identified several positive features of the service. ERO recommended that teachers strengthen their assessment, planning and internal evaluation processes, and their relationships with whānau. Teachers have continued to work on their practices in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are friendly, and confident. They have very good relationships with teachers and engage in play that interests them. Children explore the learning environments, often playing in small groups. They respond well to adult support. They also benefit from the easy flow between the indoor and outdoor spaces, and the good quality and open-ended resources. Children have a strong sense of belonging in the centre.</p><p>Infants and toddlers enjoy nurturing and affectionate care. Programmes support their developmental milestones. Teachers encourage them to explore the environment and resources. Toddlers frequently play with the older children, as they develop their mobility and social skills. This enables them to enjoy tuakana/teina relationships.</p><p>Teachers know children and families well. They use this knowledge to respond to children's individual interests. Teachers are sensitive and responsive to children with additional learning needs. Children's languages and cultures are affirmed.</p><p>Adults' conversations with children encourage them to express themselves, share their ideas, and sustain their play for periods of time. Teachers often integrate te reo Māori and foster the use of children's first languages. They support children to develop early literacy and numeracy skills in meaningful contexts. Teachers could research further ways that they can deliberately support young children to acquire language.</p><p>Teachers are trialling a new planning, assessment and evaluation process. They have started using online portfolios. Planning and assessment are displayed to promote parent contributions and teacher collaboration. As part of this improvement initiative, it would be worthwhile for teachers to plan strategies for supporting older children to develop more challenge and complexity in their play. Teachers could consider re-establishing assessment portfolios. This would enable all families to access their children's individual learning records.</p><p>Leaders and teachers maintain trusting relationships with families. They are highly aware of the social, emotional and physical needs of the centre's community. Respect for Māori and Pacific languages and cultures provides a sense of belonging for all. Leaders acknowledge that they need to engage whānau in partnerships that focus on children's learning.</p><p>Teachers enjoy good working relationships. It is timely now for teachers to re-establish evaluation systems and documentation. This would help to ensure next steps are identified to extend children's learning programmes. Processes for supporting children's transition to school should be reviewed and improved to better enable learning continuity for children.</p><p>There is a useful shared leadership approach in the centre. Teachers' strengths are valued. Leaders encourage critical and reflective practices through the appraisal process. However, they should engage external personnel to carry out manager and supervisor appraisals. Ongoing external professional learning is necessary. Leaders and teachers would benefit from sharing their individual inquiries into ways to improve practices and extend children's learning. They should undertake further work to deepen their understanding of <em>Te Whāriki</em> (2017).</p><p>The management team works well to manage centre operations and finances. They have developed a long-term and annual plan to guide centre operations. Health and safety systems and processes are established. Managers would benefit from professional assistance to build shared understandings about internal evaluation. They should also ensure they rationalise the policy review schedule.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders agree that key next steps for centre development include leaders and teachers accessing relevant external professional support to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen programme planning, assessment and evaluation to enhance the focus on extending individual children's interests and complex play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>re-establish regular opportunities for learning focused engagement with whānau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop shared understandings about, and improve systems and recording processes for, internal evaluation that results in improved teaching practices and positive outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Ao Hou Community Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>10 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
