<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1.The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p>PORSE (Play, Observe, Record, Support, Extend, Evaluate) is an in-home early childhood organisation with its National Service Office located in Hawkes Bay. Area offices are located throughout New Zealand. Within the area offices, PORSE personnel, including coaches and programme tutors, work with parents, nanny educators and home educators to provide early childhood education and care for infants, toddlers and young children. Children are cared for in their own homes or in small groups in the home of their educator.</p>
<p>The PORSE mission is &ldquo;to have all people in New Zealand schooled in nurturing and educating children in their care.&rdquo; Families are valued partners in children&rsquo;s education and care.</p>
<p>The PORSE Grey Lynn Q1 network provides a service for 115 children in the Grey Lynn area. Programme tutors, who are registered teachers, have primary responsibility for children&rsquo;s learning. They provide support, encouragement and informative resources for in-home educators. PORSE offers opportunities for educators to support each other and participate in professional development courses.</p>
<p>Educators foster children&rsquo;s social and emotional development, and children benefit from warm, caring interactions in familiar environments. Educators access regular opportunities for children to play and interact with other children through community facilities and PORSE playschools. Refocusing assessment, planning and reflective practice on children&rsquo;s learning would help programme tutors to enrich outcomes for children in both home and playschool environments.</p>
<p>Parents/wh&#257;nau select their children&rsquo;s educators. They have direct day-to-day relationships with educators and are well informed about their children&rsquo;s daily activities. Parents/wh&#257;nau are generally happy with the services offered by PORSE, and particularly appreciate the social opportunities available to their children at playschools and nature schools. PORSE could now review how the organisation supports staff in building their capability and confidence in fostering bicultural practices and to improve partnerships with wh&#257;nau M&#257;ori.</p>
<p>The PORSE coach and programme tutors agree that a next step is for them is to further develop self review and strengthen planning, assessment and evaluation practices in order to improve their support for children&rsquo;s learning. ERO suggests that PORSE review its support for programme tutors to help them refocus their work on outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO will review the service again within three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of PORSE Grey Lynn Q1 was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by PORSE Grey Lynn Q1 to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and PORSE staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the service (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atPORSE Grey Lynn Q1.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>This review of PORSE Grey Lynn Q1 is informed by organisational and local documentation, visits to homes selected by PORSE, interviews with PORSE staff and educators, written feedback from parents/wh&#257;nau, and observations of programmes provided for children.</p>
<p>In PORSE Grey Lynn Area Office a team approach means all staff have direct contact with families and educators to support enrolment, induction and office administration.</p>
<h4>Areas of good performance</h4>
<p>Relationships. Affirming, respectful relationships between staff, programme tutors, families, educators and children are a strength of the service. Practices that support positive relationships include:</p>
<ul><li>home-based education and care settings, which promote the formation of strong attachment between children and educators;</li>
<li>responsive and respectful interactions between educators and children;</li>
<li>increasing levels of communication by PORSE personnel with families and educators, including regular home visits and increased telephone/email contact; and</li>
<li>social events for staff, educators and/or families to recognise and celebrate success and progress.</li>
</ul><p>Children benefit from these positive relationships.</p>
<p>Learning environments. Children learn in appropriate, well resourced home-based learning environments. Educators also make use of PORSE playschools and other events to provide children with additional opportunities for active participation, exploration and social interaction with their peers. Reasonable steps are taken to help ensure a safe physical and emotional environment for children.</p>
<p>Programme implementation. Educators develop programmes in response to children&rsquo;s identified needs and interests. Home-based experiences are complemented by a range of group sessions in community settings. Features of the programmes provided for children include educators:</p>
<ul><li>promoting social skills and fostering children&rsquo;s sense of security and belonging through relationships and known routines;</li>
<li>encouraging children to be independent and self managing;</li>
<li>listening and responding to children&rsquo;s conversations and ideas;</li>
<li>ensuring that the home-based programme is well supported by children&rsquo;s access to appropriate resources; and</li>
<li>recording children&rsquo;s involvement in learning throughphotographic displays and journal entries.</li>
</ul><p>Collaborative team.Staff at the PORSE Grey Lynn office are workingpro-actively to build their knowledge of different roles and responsibilities within the office. This is providing opportunities to develop different skills and understandings, as well as contributing to a supportive team environment.</p>
<h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p>In depth self review. Information about self review is gathered in multiple ways. It could be beneficial for the coach and programme tutors to strengthen the evaluation of this information to ensure that educators are supported to extend children&rsquo;s learning. PORSE could:</p>
<ul><li>review the quality of appraisals for programme tutors and educators, placingan increased focus on teaching and learning and the provision of constructive feedback to increase educator capability; and</li>
<li>support programme tutors to focus on children&rsquo;s learning and progress by providing better quality feedback in their visit notes and by role modelling programme evaluation practices at playschool.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3>
<p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul><li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service;</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children;</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3>
<p>The PORSE M&#257;ori as Tangata Whenua policy promotes connections with M&#257;ori communities and professional development for staff regarding the application of the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. It aims to increase M&#257;ori participation and to have the bicultural nature of New Zealand reflected in training programmes.</p>
<p>Programme tutors at the PORSE Grey Lynn office currently have responsibility for 16 children of M&#257;ori descent.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p>Relationships with families. There is a strong emphasis on building positive, respectful and supportive relationships with educators, children and their wh&#257;nau. Daily interactions assist educators in being responsive to wh&#257;nau needs and aspirations, and provide opportunities to discuss shared strategies for working with children. Daily journal entries keep wh&#257;nau informed about their children&rsquo;s activities.</p>
<h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p>Documentation. Educators&rsquo; discussions with wh&#257;nau could be more frequently and explicitly included in family manuals, programme tutor records and children&rsquo;s journals. Recording how educators and programme tutors value and respond to children&rsquo;s cultural heritage and wh&#257;nau input is likely to contribute to more effective partnerships in supporting children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p>Review of policy and practice. It would be worthwhile for PORSE Grey Lynn Q1 to review the application of the PORSE M&#257;ori as Tangata Whenua policy and consider how they could:</p>
<ul><li>review the policy and practices against Ministry of Education Strategic plans for promoting educational success for M&#257;ori, and against ERO&rsquo;s evaluation reports and indicators of good practice in this area;</li>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management and staff of PORSE Grey Lynn Q1 completed an ERO Home-Based CareManagement Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practices, PORSE should ensure that:</p>
<ul><li>all practicable steps are taken to eliminate, isolate or minimise hazards for the safety of children;</li>
<li>medication records and records of child accidents are documented; and</li>
<li>fire and earthquake procedures are implemented and recorded.</li>
</ul><a id="5-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Recommendations</h2>

<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-porse-grey-lynn-q1" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of PORSE Grey Lynn Q1</h2>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report onPORSE (Play, Observe, Record, Support, Extend, Evaluate) is an in-home early childhood organisation with its National Service Office located in Hawkes Bay. Area offices are located throughout New Zealand. Within the area offices, PORSE personnel, including coaches and programme tutors, work with parents, nanny educators and home educators to provide early childhood education and care for infants, toddlers and young children. Children are cared for in their own homes or in small groups in the home of their educator.</p>
<p>The PORSE mission is &ldquo;to have all people in New Zealand schooled in nurturing and educating children in their care.&rdquo; Families are valued partners in children&rsquo;s education and care.</p>
<p>The PORSE Grey Lynn Q1 network provides a service for 115 children in the Grey Lynn area. Programme tutors, who are registered teachers, have primary responsibility for children&rsquo;s learning. They provide support, encouragement and informative resources for in-home educators. PORSE offers opportunities for educators to support each other and participate in professional development courses.</p>
<p>Educators foster children&rsquo;s social and emotional development, and children benefit from warm, caring interactions in familiar environments. Educators access regular opportunities for children to play and interact with other children through community facilities and PORSE playschools. Refocusing assessment, planning and reflective practice on children&rsquo;s learning would help programme tutors to enrich outcomes for children in both home and playschool environments.</p>
<p>Parents/wh&#257;nau select their children&rsquo;s educators. They have direct day-to-day relationships with educators and are well informed about their children&rsquo;s daily activities. Parents/wh&#257;nau are generally happy with the services offered by PORSE, and particularly appreciate the social opportunities available to their children at playschools and nature schools. PORSE could now review how the organisation supports staff in building their capability and confidence in fostering bicultural practices and to improve partnerships with wh&#257;nau M&#257;ori.</p>
<p>The PORSE coach and programme tutors agree that a next step is for them is to further develop self review and strengthen planning, assessment and evaluation practices in order to improve their support for children&rsquo;s learning. ERO suggests that PORSE review its support for programme tutors to help them refocus their work on outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO will review the service again within three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood service we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
