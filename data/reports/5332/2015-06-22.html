</table><p>Very limited progress has been made in addressing areas identified for improvement in the September 2012 ERO report. At this time the Hutt City Kindergarten Association does not have the capacity to provide the level of targeted support necessary for this kindergarten</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Naenae Kindergarten is located in Hutt City and provides education and care for children from two to five years of age. Extended six-hour days are offered three times a week with shorter sessions on the other two days. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 41 children. The roll has a high proportion of children who have English as their second language.</p><p>The teaching team is fully qualified and the programme is further supported by a kindergarten administrator and teacher support for lunch time cover. The kindergarten is governed by the Hutt City Kindergarten Association (the association). Currently two professional practice managers (PPMs) are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers. Since the previous review there have been several changes to the General Manager.</p><p>ERO’s 2012 report identified several areas requiring development. These included: further developing assessment practices and programme planning; extending children's learning; building on current bicultural practices; and strengthening of self review. Very limited progress is evident.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten kindergarten reviews in the Hutt City Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>At Naenae Kindergarten the programme is child led. Children take responsibility for their own play and learning. They are supported to make choices for themselves. They develop appropriate self-care skills. Independence is encouraged.</p><p>Teachers have warm and positive relationships with children and whānāu. They are supportive of children, parents and families, assisting them to become familiar with the kindergarten and its routines and expectations. A sense of inclusion is evident. Children’s and parents’ wellbeing is a major priority for teachers.</p><p>A planned and emergent curriculum is offered. Teachers should improve their understanding of planning and assessment as linked processes, and the use of deliberate teaching strategies to promote learning.</p><p>Interactions between teachers and children are warm and affirming. However, staff should develop a strong literacy and oral language programme to meet the identified English literacy needs of children.</p><p>Regular narratives highlight children’s participation in the kindergarten programme. Teachers have identified that assessment, planning and evaluation requires further development. ERO agrees and identifies key next steps as:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening analysis to identify the learning evident for the individual</li>
<li>showing how teachers will add challenge and complexity to a child’s learning to better show progress over time</li>
<li>seeking and responding to parent aspirations, and reflecting and celebrating children’s culture, language and identity.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have identified self review as an area requiring development. Improving their understanding of self review and how it can be applied to aspects of the curriculum is a key next step.</p><p>Children have opportunities to learn about Aotearoa New Zealand's cultural heritage. The environment and a range of resources reflect the Māori and Pacific backgrounds of children and their families. Te reo Māori is very evident in kindergarten documentation. Teachers have identified that they need more support to gain confidence in using te reo Māori throughout the day. Reflection of the multicultural roll at the kindergarten should be improved in the environment.</p><p>The outdoor area has recently been upgraded resulting in a large space for physical play. Increased availability of open-ended, moveable equipment should encourage children to work more actively together. There are plans to make changes to the indoors areas. Developing a strategic plan for the upgrade of the interior and resources should assist in making this project manageable.</p><p>Leadership within the kindergarten should be strengthened. Expectations and a shared understanding of acceptable levels of documentation to support children’s learning should be developed between the PPM, the head teacher and the teaching team. This is an important first step if the kindergarten is to improve the quality of the programme provided for children.</p><p>The association provides guidance and support to teachers for continuous improvement of teaching and learning. In this kindergarten it is not having the positive impact expected. Systems and processes are not leading to improvements in the quality of leadership, teaching and curriculum implementation. This kindergarten requires:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a focused and strategic approach to building the capacity of the leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>targeted reports and specific feedback from the PPM to show how effective the quality of teaching and learning is to improve outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support to develop a shared understanding of the association’s expectations, particularly relating to the quality of teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the implementation of a robust appraisal process that has a development focus.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>At the time of this review the association was involved in a process of a formal review to determine the future direction of Hutt Kindergartens. ERO identified that, within the current operating model, the capacity of senior staff to provide targeted support that promotes ongoing improvement to teaching and learning is limited.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified priorities for improvement. These are:</p><ul>
<li>building leadership and a collaborative team</li>
<li>reviewing the philosophy and developing clear indicators of high quality practice</li>
<li>consistently promoting children’s social competence and best literacy practice</li>
<li>improving assessment, planning and evaluation practices</li>
<li>promoting success for Māori and Pacific learners</li>
<li>developing understanding of self review.</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the measures used to evaluate the progress of the strategic plan</li>
<li>provide evaluative reports to support decision making</li>
<li>at a strategic level, identify strategies to promote cultural responsiveness to Māori and Pacific families</li>
<li>monitor, in each kindergarten, the robust implementation of the appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Naenae Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum and self review. To meet requirements the service needs to improve performance in the following areas and ensure it has:</p><ul>
<li>a <em>kindergarten curriculum</em><em>,</em><em>informed by assessment, planning and evaluation (documented and undocumented) that demonstrates an understanding of children’s learning, their</em> <em>interests, whānau and life contexts</em></li>
<li><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Service 2008, C2]</em></li>
<li>an ongoing process of self-review that helps the kindergarten to maintain and improve the quality of education and care.<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6]</em></li>
</ul><p>To improve practice, teachers should demonstrate an understanding of current research and best practice to inform the literacy programme provided for children.</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Naenae Kindergarten will be within two years.</p><p><img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="index-html-m2a7690f7.gif">Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>22 June 2015</p><h4>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h4><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
