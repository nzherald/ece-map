</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Foxton Playcentre is one of 19 administered by the Central Districts Playcentre Association (the association). This review is one of seven undertaken by ERO in the association’s playcentres during Term 2, 2016.</p><p>The centre is open for three mornings a week and caters for children from birth to six years of age. Responsibility for day-to-day operations is undertaken by centre-elected office holders. An experienced paid facilitator has recently been employed. She supports parents and whānau to develop and implement the daily programme. Professional advice and feedback to strengthen members’ practice is provided by a liaison officer employed by the association.</p><p>The playcentre is licensed for 25 children. This includes 15 children up to the age of two years. There are 15 children enrolled, including seven Māori children. The centre philosophy that is under review gives priority to child-led play and learning. Parents as first teachers are valued. Adults participate in training programmes that build their capability to guide teaching and learning. A high proportion of children attending the centre are aged up to two years of age. High value is placed on developing and maintaining relationships within this community of learners. A strong sense of family is evident.</p><p>Playcentre's philosophy statement, 'whānau tupu ngātahi – ‘families growing together’, reflects the value placed on families and whānau working collectively to support children’s learning.</p><p>The New Zealand Playcentre Federation is currently reviewing the organisational structure of Playcentre across New Zealand. The outcomes of this review may result in changes to operation at centre level.</p><p>An internal restructure of the association leadership has created new team roles and responsibilities at executive level. Changes include the service provider contact, president, and new executive members. Information sharing now includes digital media to enhance ease of communication and foster increased support between playcentre teams.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident in the well-resourced learning environment and actively engage in the play-based programme. They have time and space to lead their own learning. Members know children well. The high adult-child ratios foster relationships and interactions that are warm and support children's interests. Adults promote the language development of infants and toddlers, through effectively responding to their verbal and non-verbal cues.</p><p>Regular profile entries document children's exploration and engagement in the programme. Members are developing a shared understanding of assessment for learning and regularly contribute their voice to the documentation. Leadership actively supports the continuing development of planning, evaluation and assessment. This is an ongoing next step.</p><p>Parents are encouraged to undertake course training, to support the development of shared understanding of Playcentre expectations and responsibilities. The parent group bring a range of strengths to contribute to the sustained success of the centre. ERO's evaluation agrees with leaders that ongoing parent education should assist with the future sustainability of the playcentre. Leaders agree that including a stronger focus on growth and development of practice should support enhanced learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Systems for internal evaluation are in the early stages of development. Leaders are aware of the need to develop members' understanding and implementation of effective self review. The facilitator is increasing members' ability to undertake spontaneous and regular review, leading to improvement. Parents ideas are valued in the process. A key next step is for the association to provide ongoing guidance and support to develop the internal evaluation capability of members.</p><p>A bicultural perspective is evident within the centre. Adult confidence in using te reo Māori is encouraged. Continuing to gather and respond to whānau aspirations should further support positive learning outcomes for Māori children.</p><p>Leaders have identified and ERO agrees that developing transition to school is a next step.</p><p>The association has recently redeveloped their appraisal process. This has yet to be set in place for the new facilitator. As the association develops new policies in line with recent legislation there is a need to communicate why these are relevant and how they are to be incorporated into practice at centre level.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>At centre level, the priorities are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>to further develop understanding and implementation of internal evaluation to inform decision making</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing improvement of assessment, planning and evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association should further develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>systems to consistently respond to centre needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>understanding and implementation of internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistent, systematic appraisal for all employees</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>members' understanding of assessment, planning, evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the association actively participate in and monitor the quality of support provided throughout the Playcentre restructure to ensure implementation of requirements that promote sustainability.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Foxton Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Foxton Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>27 July 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
