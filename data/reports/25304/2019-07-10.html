</table><p>Seugagogo Aoga Amata Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Seugagogo Aoga Amata Preschool is licensed to provide full-day education and care for 60 children, including up to 18 infants and toddlers. The service's philosophy has a strong focus on promoting Samoan language, culture and identity, and Christian values. Most children are of Samoan heritage, and a small numbers are of other Pacific groups and NZ European/Pākehā.</p><p>A new building (Nikau) caters for children aged three to five years of age. The infants and toddlers remain in the neighbouring original building (Mason).</p><p>Since ERO's 2015 review, a new supervisor has been appointed in Mason, and four teachers have been appointed in both teaching areas. A centre manager guides teaching practice for both areas. All teachers are qualified and there are two teacher aides in support roles.</p><p>The aoga amata operates under the umbrella of the Congregational Christian Church of Samoa. The aoga amata board is responsible for governance, comprises of church, parents and staff representatives.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified key development areas, including the quality of teaching, learning and self-review. Positive progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Seugagogo Aoga Amata Preschool is well placed to continue promoting positive learning outcomes for children. Children are friendly, confident, and interact well with their peers and teachers. They are empowered to take increasing responsibility for the wellbeing of themselves and others. Children have a strong pride and sense of belonging in Samoan language, culture and identity. Teachers deliberately foster children's social and emotional competence.</p><p>Children participate in an integrated programme that allows them to freely explore the well-resourced indoor and outdoor learning environments. They are happy and active in the decisions about their own play choices. Children enjoy group times and the many music and movement learning opportunities. They confidently speak and sing in the Samoan language, and willingly share conversations with each other and adults.</p><p>Children are challenged to follow up on an interest with greater depth. They benefit from learning programmes based on concepts that identify their interests, dispositions, and next steps for learning. Children enjoy a range of learning opportunities through centre excursions that enhance their development.</p><p>Teachers' effective teaching practices support children’s play. The assessment processes and programme planning align closely to <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum<em>.</em> Teachers work well as a team to develop their leadership skills. They are supportive of each other and promote the centre's goals and values, including fostering children's joy in learning. Teachers prioritise opportunities to build children's oral language in learning interactions.</p><p>Te reo me ōna tikanga Māori is a feature of the centre. Cultural events are celebrated with children and families. Centre leaders are committed to continuing to develop the centre's bicultural curriculum.</p><p>Teachers have recently reviewed and strengthened transition processes. Children experience positive transitions within the centre and on to school, supported by responsive partnerships with families and neighbouring schools. Their sense of belonging is nurtured during and after transitions.</p><p>Teachers are welcoming to children and families. They provide many opportunities to keep parents informed. Teachers gather family aspirations that contribute to programme planning.</p><p>The aoga amata is well led. Managers and trustees are strategic and financially prudent. They consider the centre's long-term sustainability, and ensure that children's wellbeing and learning are priorities. Strategic planning is comprehensive and focused on ongoing improvement. Internal evaluation is well understood, purposeful and focused on improved outcomes for children. An effective leadership approach and a professional learning structure provides mentoring, leadership, relevant professional development, and appraisal support for teachers to improve their teaching practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have identified key next steps for ongoing improvement. They include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to embed the philosophy of <em>Te Whāriki</em> and teaching strategies to extend children's thinking and creativity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the bicultural perspective in the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to improve learning environments to reflect the aoga's philosophy of fa'a Samoa and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhancing internal evaluation processes by using indicators of effective practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing and refining centre policies to distinguish between policy and procedures.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Seugagogo Aoga Amata Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>10 July 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
