</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Immanuel Preschool in Mangere East was established in 2010 and operates from a renovated house. This centre is one of three centres in the South Auckland region under the same ownership. It provides care and education for babies and children up to school age. Older children are catered for in the house, and a sleepout on the property is used for children up to the age of two years. The centre offers full day and sessional education and care programmes to meet the needs of community children, who are mostly of Māori and various Pacific ethnicities.</p><p>Almost all teachers are qualified and there are three registered teachers. They reflect the various ethnicities of the community. The experienced manager oversees centre operations and administration. She is supported by the centre supervisor who manages the curriculum, mentors staff and oversees the daily running of the centre.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy is based on Christian values, with compassion, service and respect promoted for children in a caring environment. These values are evident in the programme. The centre’s approach to education is consistent with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The 2011 ERO report identified strengths which have been maintained. These strengths include confident children, respectful and responsive teachers, and strong parent partnerships. The manager has addressed areas identified for improvement in the 2011 ERO report, making significant progress in upgrading the physical environment and children’s learning resources.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging in the centre. They know centre routines and settle quickly when they arrive at the start of their day. Children can see their cultural identities visibly displayed throughout the centre. They hear their languages spoken to them by teachers and used at mat-time through singing or storytelling. The culture, language and identity of tangata Māori is supported and celebrated in the programme.</p><p>Children are secure with their teachers and confident to explore the learning environment. Trips outside of the centre provide an extension for children’s learning and promote opportunities for real life experiences.</p><p>Children with special education needs have individualised programmes that nurture their sense of belonging and wellbeing. Parents interviewed by ERO speak very highly of the support and compassion they experienced at the centre.</p><p>Children have opportunities to develop early literacy and mathematical skills in the context of play. They learn different ways to use mathematics in everyday life. Some teachers provide open-ended resources for mathematical exploration. Children engage with teachers in games and activities that are meaningful and enjoyable. It could now be useful for teachers to formally review the teaching and learning of mathematics in the curriculum.</p><p>Teachers interact positively with children and value their play. Teachers encourage children to contribute to the learning programme. Tuakana/teina approaches are positively modelled by older children, who care and play well with younger children. Teachers provide opportunities for children to learn the languages and cultures of other children in the centre. They use regular meeting times to evaluate learning programmes and discuss how they can support older children and their families to prepare for school.</p><p>Strong parent partnerships are evident. The families ERO talked to during the review say they are confident to visit, talk with teachers, ask questions and offer information about their children. They appreciate the time teachers take to talk with them about their children’s learning. Parents also stated that the manager promotes an inclusive culture that results in positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre continues to promote effective communication with parents and whānau. It has a well developed self-review system that includes contributions from the centre’s community.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that further work could now be done to strengthen the use of:</p><ul>
<li>teaching practices that further extend children’s learning and interests</li>
<li>assessment practices to ensure that children's progress is more clearly recorded and to show their learning and development over time.</li>
</ul><p>The sleepout building used for children up to the age of two years should be upgraded to improve the food handling area and toilet facility.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Immanuel Preschool (Mangere) completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Immanuel Preschool (Mangere) will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>15 December 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
