</table><p>Requires further development</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kaeo Playcentre operates as a parent cooperative. It is located in the small rural town of Kaeo beside the local primary school. It has a strong relationship with the school and this benefits children when they transition to school. The centre provides one early childhood session a week for a small group of children up to six years of age. Most of the children enrolled are of Māori descent.</p><p>The centre is part of the Mid North Playcentre Association. The association provides a framework of governance and management systems. It also provides ongoing parent education programmes for members.</p><p>Since ERO’s review in 2011 there have been changes in centre membership. Parents manage the centre and are committed to Playcentre values and philosophy. However they are finding it increasingly difficult to manage the centre, maintain the needed parent education levels, and sustain and grow the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from positive relationships with each other and parents who attend sessions. They are settled and have a sense of belonging in the centre. Children have good oral language skills and have warm friendly conversations with each other and the adults around them.</p><p>The centre has an attractive and purposeful environment and this supports children to become confident and capable learners. It provides opportunities for them to experience challenge and to grow in confidence and capability. Toddlers play alongside older children within the session.</p><p>The programme is responsive to children’s interests and they are provided with a good range of play choices. Children play well, both independently and cooperatively. Good centre resourcing supports children’s play and the activities they choose. Some whānau engage well with children, providing good guidance and skilfully affirming and extending their play. Through parent education programmes, adults are developing the skills to notice, recognise and respond to the needs and interests of all children.</p><p>Centre members endorse Playcentre’s commitment to te Tiriti o Waitangi and New Zealand’s bicultural heritage. They include some te reo and tikanga Māori in children’s learning, but also recognise that this area of the programme would benefit from ongoing development.</p><p>More experienced members provide good leadership. They are focused on increasing centre membership and parent education training levels. These members are committed to reaching out to the community and on continuing to build strong relationships with other parents and their children.</p><p>Most administration, management and housekeeping duties are undertaken by a core group. To ensure the centre's sustainability, more members now need to become actively involved in the Playcentre and in training. While members recognise the value of strengthening their role, they also identify challenges in achieving this goal. They particularly note two issues that are negatively impacting on the centre: the geographical isolation of many families which prevents them attending centre sessions, and the distance they need to travel to attend training sessions in nearby regional centres. The Mid North Playcentre Association is aware of the significance of these issues. A key consideration for the association is how it can further support the centre to address the challenges it faces.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members and ERO agree that in order to improve learning outcomes for children, they need to:</p><ul>
<li>regularly document, plan, assess and evaluate their practices to help extend children’s learning</li>
<li>review the centre’s philosophy to help establish a greater sense of shared ownership of the centre</li>
<li>use self review to streamline management responsibilities.</li>
</ul><p>In order to ensure sustainability the Mid North Association should support the centre to:</p><ul>
<li>increase and sustain enrolments so that the centre can operate more effectively as a parent cooperative</li>
<li>develop a strategic plan specific to, and recognising the needs of, Kaeo whānau with a view to making a positive difference for children</li>
<li>provide accessible ongoing support and learning and development for parents/whānau.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kaeo Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified the following areas of non-compliance relating to centre practices and performance. To meet requirements the service now needs to improve its performance by ensuring:</p><ul>
<li>the centre’s curriculum is informed by assessment, planning and evaluation that demonstrates an understanding of children’s learning and their interests, whānau and life contexts</li>
<li>adults engage in meaningful, positive interactions to enhance children’s learning and demonstrate an understanding of children’s learning and development</li>
<li>centre documentation provides evidence of compliance with legal requirements</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008; C1 (13), C2, C3, C4].</em></p><h4>Development Plan Recommendation</h4><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kaeo Playcentre will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer-Northern Northern Region</p><p>13 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
