</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Avondale Kindergarten is in West Auckland next to a primary school. It operates as a Kindergarten Day Model which enables children to attend sessions similar to school hours. The kindergarten provides education and care for up to 40 children over two years to school age. It is staffed by a head teacher, three other registered teachers, an administrator and a teacher aide.</p><p>The teaching team has remained the same since the 2012 ERO review. Teachers continue to provide the good quality practices noted in the 2012 ERO report. They have engaged in professional learning to enhance their teaching practice. The kindergarten has advanced to a Silver level in the Enviroschools programme.</p><p>Fostering child-led learning, inclusion and celebrating cultural diversity are embedded in the kindergarten’s philosophy. Teachers promote learning about environmental sustainability and healthy lifestyles.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association, which provides leadership, a management framework, support personnel and a programme of professional development for teachers. In 2015, after extensive review and consultation, the association launched a new 10 year strategic plan. The association’s approach to rolling out a substantial change in its organisational structure has been carefully considered.</p><p>New association roles have been established to provide more targeted support for kindergartens and professional development for head teachers in their leadership roles. A Quality Improvement Process (QIP) is being implemented to monitor quality and promote ongoing improvement in kindergartens.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children have fun and are confident, eager learners. They engage in sustained co-operative play, make choices and explore and learn at their own pace. Children have leadership opportunities that include sharing their cultures with others. They are developing an understanding of and a sense of responsibility and respect for themselves, others and the environment.</p><p>Children show a strong sense of belonging in the kindergarten and their cultural identities are affirmed. Teachers encourage children to share their ideas. They engage children in sustained conversations, often using their home languages. Te reo and tikanga Māori are integrated in meaningful ways in consultation with whānau. Teachers are keen to continue to develop bicultural practices.</p><p>Children learn in an attractive well resourced environment that reflects the multicultural backgrounds of children attending. They have very good opportunities to explore and be physically active in the spacious outdoor area. Children are encouraged to be creative and engage in a wide variety of art, dance, and music activities.</p><p>Teachers provide a responsive curriculum that is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Their respect for learning through play is evident in the meaningful learning opportunities they offer to children. Teachers’ caring and supportive interactions help children to learn about literacy, mathematics, science and technology concepts in relevant ways.</p><p>There is a strong sense of unity, purpose and collaboration in the kindergarten. Teachers have respectful relationships with children and their families and strong connections with the local community. They encourage parent/whānau involvement in the kindergarten, inviting them to share their expertise and ideas. Good connections with local primary schools support children as they transition to school.</p><p>Teachers are culturally responsive and have a strong sense of social justice. They are committed to fostering equity and inclusion by promoting positive outcomes for all children. They actively support children’s physical and emotional wellbeing.</p><p>Collaborative working relationships contribute to the kindergarten’s culture of care and respect. The head teacher encourages teachers to take leadership roles that build on their strengths and interests. Self review is well established, however teachers are aware documentation could be strengthened.</p><p>The association provides timely, in depth support for the head teacher and the team. Its strategic plan provides a stepping stone for the kindergarten to build on to meet the needs of its local community.</p><p>The association has a strong commitment to biculturalism and in embracing diversity. Resources and personnel have been targeted to ensure that the specific needs of children and their families are met.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teaching team, and Association Education Specialist agree that teachers could continue to:</p><ul>
<li>offer children more opportunities to become critical thinkers</li>
<li>strengthen self review to more clearly show teachers’ evaluative thinking and how review impacts positively on outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Avondale Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Avondale Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>29 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><h3>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h3><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
