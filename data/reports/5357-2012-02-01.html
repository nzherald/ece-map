<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p><span>Lyall Bay Kindergarten</span> is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p><span>Children&rsquo;s individual development is supported and nurtured in the strongly inclusive culture. The teaching team has been established since Term 2, 2011.</span></p><p>Teachers welcome parents and children warmly. They are approachable and open in their communications. Teachers know the children well and demonstrate an interest in the child&rsquo;s social and emotional well-being. Children are confident in their interactions with each other, are provided with equitable opportunities for learning, and participate in sustained play as individuals, and within groups.</p><p>Teachers are aware of the need to continue to deepen links with the wider community, increase the accessibility of the programme to parents and increase parents&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s perspectives in assessment. To support this process, teachers are beginning to establish a cycle of continuous improvement including systematic self review. Doing so will enable them to develop a more comprehensive framework with which to review the programme and other aspects of operation.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Lyall Bay Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atLyall Bay Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The April 2008 ERO report recognised that the kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy of having a holistic approach to teaching and providing choices for children was evident in the learning environment. ERO found that this philosophy supports the overall strengths of the programme which provides opportunities for children to learn in cooperative, respectful and responsible ways.</p><p>There is a new teaching team at the kindergarten. They are continuing to focus on creating shared understandings and expectations for children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h3>Programme</h3><h4>Areas of strength</h4><ul>
<li>
<p>The programme is child centred and fosters children&rsquo;s independence and decision-making skills. Children engage in sustained, collaborative and cooperative play as individuals and groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teachers create a range of opportunities for parents to participate in the development of the programme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children&rsquo;s learning is recorded and assessed through a rich, narrative approach. This allows teachers to track and respond to children&rsquo;s individual dispositions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teachers are focused on children&rsquo;s holistic development and provide opportunities for creating links between learning at the kindergarten and at home. They know children and families well. Teachers identify and respond to children&rsquo;s strengths and needs, which forms the bases of their spontaneous self-review. Aspects of systematic self review are developing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The integration of te reo M&#257;ori within the programme is emerging.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>Teachers have identified and ERO agrees they need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to make the programme visible to parents. Doing so would increase opportunities to include parents&rsquo; perspectives in the assessment of their children&rsquo;s learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider the place of te reo M&#257;ori within a broader approach to the bicultural context of Aotearoa/New Zealand. Teachers are currently focused on developing their capabilities in this area</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish a cycle of continuous improvement. This would enable teachers to more strategically identify opportunities to enhance and extend children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Environment</h3><h4>Areas of strength</h4><ul>
<li>
<p>The indoor and outdoor environments are flexible, spacious and allow for extension of curriculum areas. Children have easy access to all activities and a wide range of resources, adding levels of complexity to their play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children use a wide range of moveable equipment which provides ongoing challenge to their developing physical skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wall displays of children&rsquo;s learning are attractive and informative.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><ul>
<li>
<p>Teachers are aware of the need to continue to embed recently adjusted routines and transition times, and maintain the physical environment to support these changes.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Interactions</h3><h4>Areas of strength</h4><ul>
<li>
<p>There is a warm, settled tone in the centre. Relationships between staff are supportive, positive and affirming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teachers encourage children in a range of ways, nurturing their sense of independence and autonomy in decision making.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children&rsquo;s interests are extended by teachers drawing on their prior knowledge and using a range of prompts to extend learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teachers model appropriate conflict resolution and negotiation skills. A consistent approach to developing children&rsquo;s social competence is evident.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>Area for development and review</h4><ul>
<li>
<p>Making specific connections across curriculum areas would facilitate the enrichment and extension of children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Association Support</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the strategic plan, setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a wide range of professional development opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice, as a result of feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs are supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><p>The kindergarten has children with severe to moderate special needs currently enrolled.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><ul>
<li>

</ul><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Lyall Bay Kindergarten completed an ERO <span>Centre Management Assurance Statement</span> and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><p>1 February 2012</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-lyall-bay-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Lyall Bay Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Lyall Bay Kindergarten.</p><p><span>Lyall Bay Kindergarten</span> is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><p><span>Children&rsquo;s individual development is supported and nurtured in the strongly inclusive culture. The teaching team has been established since Term 2, 2011.</span></p><p>Teachers welcome parents and children warmly. They are approachable and open in their communications. Teachers know the children well and demonstrate an interest in the child&rsquo;s social and emotional well-being. Children are confident in their interactions with each other, are provided with equitable opportunities for learning, and participate in sustained play as individuals, and within groups.</p><p>Teachers are aware of the need to continue to deepen links with the wider community, increase the accessibility of the programme to parents and increase parents&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s perspectives in assessment. To support this process, teachers are beginning to establish a cycle of continuous improvement including systematic self review. Doing so will enable them to develop a more comprehensive framework with which to review the programme and other aspects of operation.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Kathleen Atkins</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
