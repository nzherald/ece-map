</table><p>Ongoing, targeted association support should assist Dannevirke Central Kindergarten to be better placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children. Further development is needed in management, systems and leadership.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Dannevirke Central Kindergarten is in Dannevirke, Tararua. It provides early childhood education and care for up to 40 children aged over two. The current roll is 47 children, including 34 Māori children.</p><p>It is one of two kindergartens managed by the Dannevirke Kindergarten Association (the association). A governing body is responsible for setting the overall strategic and policy direction of the organisation. An association manager is employed to manage the day-to-day operations. A professional practice manager (PPM) supports kindergarten teachers in their delivery of the curriculum.</p><p>Since the January 2013 ERO report, four successive PPMs have been employed. For several months, the PPM role was not filled. In January 2015, the association contracted the role of PPM to an external provider. The present PPM was allocated by the provider in March 2016.</p><p>In 2013, the association opened up a purpose-built association whānau room, Te Whāre Koha. This is used as a learning and social hub for kindergarten whānau and the wider Dannevirke community.</p><p>The previous ERO report for Dannevirke Central Kindergarten identified a number of areas needing further development including: review of the philosophy; assessment, planning and evaluation; a culturally responsive curriculum and teaching practices; and self review. These areas continue to require action, as limited progress is evident.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of two reviews in the Dannevirke Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers know the children well. Children are familiar with the routines and settle quickly. A sense of belonging for children, parents and whānau is fostered through warm respectful relationships.</p><p>Children with additional needs are warmly welcomed. They are well supported within an inclusive environment.</p><p>Successful transitions for children are supported by a range of useful strategies and effective partnerships between families and the kindergarten and schools.</p><p>Children eagerly participate in a programme that is both child and teacher-initiated. They are confidentand engage in sustained play and access a good range of activities and resources. Teachers foster children's language development well. They organise the environment to make the most of learning opportunities and provide resources to promote children's curiosity and exploration. There is a kindergarten-wide focus on promoting active movement and healthy eating. Regular excursions into the local community enrich the curriculum.</p><p>Children show confidence and high levels of independence. Literacy, mathematics and science learning experiences are woven throughout the daily programme. Children learn alongside their peers, making decisions about experiences in which they want to be involved. Teachers' model and support children’s social development. Bicultural perspectives are evident in te reo Māori use, protocols and music.</p><p>Teachers and leaders acknowledge that they need to build their capability to be responsive to Māori children’s culture, language and identity. This development should include establishing strong learning partnerships with whānau and making use of Ministry of Education resources such as,<em>Ka Hikitia - Accelerating Success 2013-2017</em> and <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners.</em></p><p>Assessment portfolios provide a useful record of children’s participation and involvement in kindergarten experiences and activities. Some show evidence of teachers revisiting and extending children’s learning. Parents are provided with opportunities to comment. It is timely to review portfolios to ensure that the full range of learning is captured. The emphasis on children’s individual learning and progress needs to develop in these books.</p><p>Strengthening assessment, planning and evaluation has been a focus and identified by the PPM in 2015 as requiring further development. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>having clear expectations for high quality and regular learning stories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improved processes to identify learning and respond to it to inform future planning. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers work collaboratively. All staff have clear roles and responsibilities and their individual strengths and talents are acknowledged and used to support children’s learning. The head teacher requires support with curriculum leadership to effectively lead the team.</p><p>Some positive changes have occurred in response to kindergarten use of internal evaluation. A useful framework provides guidance. However, strengthening internal evaluation remains a next step.</p><p>The association should strengthen its governance and management of the kindergarten. The association has experienced difficulty in filling the role of professional practice manager. Managing the impact of this has been a challenge for the board. Not all PPMs have kept trustees well informed of the quality of curriculum delivery or of their communications with individual kindergartens and teachers. Strengthening processes around the recruitment and expectations of the PPM role is an important next step.</p><p>Appropriate policies are in place to inform and guide kindergarten operations. Board members show a commitment to the organisation. They attend training to better understand their governance roles. Their recent review of the appraisal process has led to positive changes in line with recent best practice guidelines for teacher registration and licence renewal.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The kindergarten and association have yet to fully address all areas for development identified in the 2013 ERO report. Current, good early childhood practice is evident in the other kindergarten in this association. Good practice, particularly in assessment, planning and evaluation should be shared.</p><p>The association manager, PPM, head teacher and staff agree on the following key next steps for Dannevirke Central Kindergarten. Led by the head teacher, staff should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improve assessment, planning and evaluation to add depth and complexity to children's learning and show progress over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop their understanding and use of internal evaluation to support ongoing kindergarten improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>integrate te ao Māori and culturally responsive practices to support success for Māori as Māori.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Trustees and the association manager of Dannevirke Kindergarten Association should continue to strengthen processes to build teacher capabilities. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>evaluating the effectiveness of the current method of accessing professional practice support for teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making clear their expectations for the role of the PPM, including clear guidance on the expected regularity and content of reports to the board</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing protocols for communication exchange between PPMs and individual kindergarten and teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clarifying responsibilities for the appraisal of contracted PPMs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the on-site phase of the review, the association has started to address these issues. </p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Dannevirke Central Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice service leaders now need to focus on raising the quality of teaching and learning practices and the curriculum.</p><p>To meet agreed accountabilities the service provider must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the service curriculum is informed by assessment, planning, and evaluation (documented and undocumented) that demonstrates an understanding of children's learning, their interests, whānau, and life contexts.<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008: C2]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Dannevirke Central Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>14 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
