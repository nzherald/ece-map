</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><p>There is considerable work to be done in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>self-review</li>
<li>centre leadership</li>
<li>performance management, including appraisal and programme planning.</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3><p>Giggles Rainbow Kidz was previously called Giggles Nursery, and is a privately owned childcare service located in the business area of Te Puke township. The centre is licensed to provide all day education and care for up to 10 children under 2 years of age. There are currently 8 children enrolled, including 2 Māori children. The centre caters for children aged from birth to 5 years. Children over 2 years of age, are catered for at Giggles Bizzy Beez which operates under the same ownership. The centre is licensed under the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008. Since the last ERO review in 2012, there have been ongoing and significant personnel changes.</p><p>Families attending the service come from the local Te Puke community. A large number of Indian seasonal workers choose the centre for their children. A staff member, also of Indian descent, is able to provide first language support for many of the parents and families. The centre owners acknowledge that the transient nature of many children and the resulting fluctuations in the centre roll provide additional challenges for the service in establishing long-term partnerships with parents and families.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The main indoor play area for children is large and well resourced with a range of age-appropriate equipment. The outdoor area is also well equipped and provides young children with many and varied challenges and opportunities to explore. A feature of the service is the effective use of natural materials such as stones, flax and shells.</p><p>Teachers have made a useful start to improving their professional knowledge about early childhood education through externally facilitated professional development provided by the Ministry of Education. This development is building teachers’ knowledge of self review as planned and systematic enquiry, and includes links to relevant research and theory. In addition, it is supporting teachers to improve the way they notice children’s learning and record these observations in individual children’s portfolio books. This teacher education is expected to improve the effectiveness of the way teachers support the education and care of children attending the service.</p><p>Interactions observed by ERO were sensitive and supportive of children’s need for physical care and attention. However, there is a need for teachers to improve the way they support children’s developing ideas and dispositions. It is also important for teachers to develop the skills necessary to genuinely listen to children in order to explore the deeper meanings of children’s learning. More effective use of strategies, such as the use of open-ended questions and allowing children time to choose and explore, is likely to benefit children’s development and sense of belonging.</p><p>Collegial relationships are evident within the teaching team and teachers feel well supported by the centre owners. A distributive approach to leadership enables all teachers to take turns at undertaking leadership roles and responsibilities. A professional practice manager has been employed by the owners to provide additional support for teachers. However, this person is in a part-time role and also works with two other centres owned by the same organisation. There is, therefore a need to ensure that teachers have more regular and ongoing access to a designated person with leadership knowledge, specific roles and responsibilities. This is likely to ensure that roles and expectations for teachers are clear and that there is a well-managed approach to building leadership capability within the service.</p><p>Although a new system for appraising teacher performance was introduced in 2014, it needs to be fully implemented and include important aspects such as documented professional goals, observations of teacher practice, regular documented reflection and ongoing feedback about ways to improve outcomes for children and families.</p><p>The centre owners provide clear direction and expectations for the service and have introduced a plan to guide self review. This plan provides guidelines for teachers about which aspect of the service should be reviewed over time. It is now important for owners to ensure that self-review processes are well understood by teachers and effectively implemented. Such developments should enable decisions about centre direction and improvement to be made on the basis of a greater range of good quality documented evidence.</p><p>The programme in the centre is planned to cater for children’s emerging interests and ideas, and teachers have made a useful start to documenting planning processes. It is now important for teachers to improve their understanding of planning for this group of young children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and management agree that the important areas for review and development are to:</p><ul>
<li>improve the effectiveness of professional leadership for teachers</li>
<li>consolidate and embed planned and strategic self review</li>
<li>fully implement the new performance appraisal process for all staff</li>
<li>continue with externally provided professional learning to improve the way teachers support and extend children’s learning and development.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that centre owners ensure teachers access appropriate professional development to address the areas identified in the Key Next Steps section above.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Giggles Rainbow Kidz completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to self review, health and safety, human resource management and curriculum. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>the centre owner must ensure that an ongoing process for self review helps the service maintain and improve the quality of and education care it provides. [GMA6]</li>
<li>the centre owner must ensure that effective human resource management practices are consistently implemented and outcomes well documented. [GMA7].</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Giggles Rainbow Kidz will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>20 April 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
