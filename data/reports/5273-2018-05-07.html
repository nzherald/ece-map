</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pickering Street Kindergarten is adjacent to Waikirikiri School in Gisborne. It opens from 8:30am to 2:30pm Monday to Thursday and 8:30am to 12:45pm on Friday. The service is licensed for up to 40 children aged from two years to school age. Of the 28 children currently enrolled, 26 identify as Māori.</p><p>The centre philosophy emphasises the importance of manaakitanga, whakawhanaungatanga and rangatiratanga.</p><p>The recently appointed head teacher oversees day-to-day operation of the centre. All teachers are fully qualified and are supported by a teacher aide and kaiawhina. Staff have participated in professional development provided by the Gisborne Kindergarten Association (the association) which has included learning about te ao Māori, working with younger children and assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>Pickering Street is one of 11 kindergartens governed and managed by the association. Two senior teachers provide professional support and guidance to individual kindergartens. A pouawhina has been appointed on a fixed-term contract to guide kindergartens' implementation of tikanga and kaupapa Māori practices.</p><p>The September 2014 ERO report identified a number of areas requiring review and development at the kindergarten level, including: consistency of teacher practice; educational success for Māori as Māori; learning-centred relationships; and self review. Good progress has been made in all these areas. It was identified that the association should undertake strategic self review. Progress is ongoing.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the Gisborne Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children confidently engage in a play-based, bicultural curriculum. The environment is intentionally designed to invite exploration. Te ao Māori and kaupapa Māori concepts are highly valued and well established in practice. Te reo Māori is meaningfully spoken in extended conversations. Children make choices, take risks and are involved in sustained periods of play.</p><p>Teachers work effectively alongside children to progress their learning. Deliberate strategies are used to extend thinking, support children's goals and develop their social competence. Positive relationships are evident throughout the kindergarten.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported to achieve positive outcomes. Teachers liaise with parents, whānau, and external agencies to progress their goals.</p><p>Learning partnerships with whānau are strengthening. Teachers and whānau work together to design learning goals for individuals, and families have opportunities to be actively involved in their children's learning. This provides a platform for parents to define what educational success looks like for their children.</p><p>Understanding of strategies to promote educational success for Pacific children is emerging. ERO's evaluation confirms this ongoing focus.</p><p>Comprehensive assessment, planning and evaluation effectively progresses children's learning over time. Assessment is based on individual children's strengths and interests and strongly aligned to the centre philosophy. Children's portfolios record their progress towards learning goals and are beginning to reflect their prior knowledge and identity. Further extending these goals to give more consideration to the breadth and depth of children's learning journeys is required.</p><p>Staff show a strong commitment to the values of the service and the community. Collaborative ways of working are fostered amongst the new team. It is timely to develop a curriculum that reflects its local context in consultation with parents and whānau. This should encompass a review of the centre philosophy, strengthening placed-based learning, and further opportunities for children to connect to their individual culture, language and identity.</p><p>Teachers are well supported to develop their practice. There is a strong commitment to developing staff knowledge and skills through ongoing professional learning and the sharing of good practice. Senior teachers regularly identify actions and provoke thinking in relation to children's learning. The newly developed appraisal system, when fully implemented, should strengthen teachers' inquiries into their own practice.</p><p>Association leaders have a well-considered approach to progressing strategic objectives. Connections to the community are strong and maintaining these continues to be a focus. Leaders are committed to Treaty-based partnerships and acknowledging Māori as tangata whenua. The association has identified that developing shared understanding of internal evaluation is a priority. ERO evaluation confirms this.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the priority is to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review and develop a curriculum that reflects its local context.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>fully implement the new appraisal system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop shared understanding and use of internal evaluation across all levels of operation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pickering Street Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pickering Street Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>7 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
