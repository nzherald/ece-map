</table><p>Cherry’s on Maryhill is <em>very well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Cherry’s on Maryhill is located in Hoon Hay, Christchurch. It provides education and care for children from birth to five years of age. All teachers are qualified and all have early childhood education qualifications. The philosophy reflects the centre’s strong commitment to children’s learning and development in a caring, safe and natural environment. Teachers and families also support children in learning to care for others in need in their community.</p><p>The centre is an enviroschool and has a Bronze award for their awareness and care of the environment. The staff and children are working towards achieving a Silver award.</p><p>The management team has made good progress in meeting the recommendations outlined in the September 2011 ERO report. Teachers now use assessment information to plan activities that are linked to children’s interests or needs. Older children talk confidently about their learning and where they can find answers to their questions. Reflection on the effectiveness of practices to impact children’s learning is an area for further development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are calm, settled and busy in a well-designed and natural learning environment. Infants and toddlers are well cared for. They are highly communicative and social. A feature of the programme is the conversations teachers have with these very young children and the many ways that they support language development.</p><p>Older children are confident and competent learners. They enjoy sharing their learning with their friends and families/whānau. They have many opportunities to develop their literacy and mathematics knowledge throughout the programme. The regular interactions with students from neighbouring schools further promotes children’s socialisation skills and interest in reading.</p><p>Māori children are able to hear and use their language often during the programme. Te reo and tikanga Māori are naturally integrated. Bicultural aspects are regularly acknowledged in the learning stories.</p><p>Teachers collect very useful information for child assessment and planning. The principles and strands of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum<em>,</em> are well understood and used to guide the programme. Teachers skilfully identify learning and make good use of children’s interests to extend their learning and social skills. They help children to take responsibility for their own learning and what they will learn next. Teachers use the professional development opportunities to develop shared understandings and plan as a team to promote children’s learning.</p><p>Parents regularly support and contribute to the programme. The centre also enjoys positive relationships with staff and students from neighbouring schools.</p><p>The management team maintains a strong focus on building capability and capacity at all levels. Managers recognise and use the skills of the staff to further strengthen the programme. Staff appraisal is appropriately linked to the centre’s goals and to improving the quality of teaching. The next step is for the managers to ensure that all aspects of the registered teacher criteria are met over time.</p><p>Self review is well planned and focused on improvement. It includes both the spontaneous and planned reviews of policies and specific areas of practice. The next step is to make the reviews more clearly focused on further raising the quality of practice.</p><p>The centre’s long-term plan clearly outlines the centre’s goals and future direction.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre managers and ERO agree, that in order to continue to improve the quality of the service:</p><ul>
<li>teachers consider extending self review to identify strategies that promote effective outcomes for children’s learning in different curriculum areas</li>
<li>managers provide further opportunities for professional learning and development, particularly in deepening children's understandings of mathematics concepts.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Cherry's on Maryhill completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Cherry's on Maryhill will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>28 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
