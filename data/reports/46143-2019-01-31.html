</table><p>Choice Kids Mahia Road requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Choice Kids managers and teachers require support to establish effective management systems that prioritise children's learning, improve learning environments and implement programmes that are based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Choice Kids Mahia Road opened in 2013. It is located in Manurewa and is one of eight services governed and managed by the Choice Kids organisation. The centre is licensed to provide full-day education and care for 40 children over two years of age. Most of the children are Māori or have Pacific heritage.</p><p>A new centre manager works with a team that includes three qualified teachers. The centre's philosophy has recently been reviewed.</p><p>In 2015 ERO identified several areas to improve, including teachers' planning, assessment, evaluation and bicultural practices. Teachers' appraisal, strategic planning and self review were also identified as key next steps. There has been very little progress in these areas. It remains a challenge for teachers and leaders to achieve and sustain good quality practices to support children's learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and engage in basic activities in a supportive environment. Children play well with each other and have formed positive friendships. They choose from a range of activities set up by teachers.</p><p>Teachers are welcoming and approachable. Their interactions with children are generally positive. Parents appreciate support from teachers in an inclusive, family friendly environment.</p><p>Children are familiar with, and actively participate in, centre routines. Teachers promote children's responsibility and self-management well during these times.</p><p>The programme for children should be more closely aligned to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers need to develop a shared vision and a quality programme that engages children in their learning. They could improve the programme by gaining deeper understanding of theories about learning and development in early childhood. Teachers have begun professional learning to develop effective teaching practices, but this is yet to impact positively on children's learning.</p><p>Teachers are beginning to promote a bicultural programme for children, and should continue to support children's growing sense of their cultural identity. Teachers should ensure the programme and teaching strategies are more responsive to children's individual interests and cultural backgrounds. Programmes should offer a greater variety of engaging and challenging educational resources and physical activities.</p><p>Managers have identified the need to improve the learning environments. Teachers could promote learning through play by setting up inviting and stimulating learning environments in distinct play areas. Resources should be readily accessible, challenging and sufficient for learning. More opportunities for wonder, curiosity and creativity in the programme would help to foster children's learning.</p><p>Teachers are beginning to develop assessment practices that focus on individual children. They provide whānau with regular information about their children's learning. Teachers now need to focus programme planning on teaching and learning strategies rather than on activities.</p><p>Management systems are developing. The centre's strategic plan should include clear strategic goals that align with indicators of effective practice. Internal evaluation is yet to be effectively established. The centre's policy framework needs to be consistently aligned with the Vulnerable Children's Act. Performance management systems are yet to be established.</p><p>The centre manager would benefit from leadership training. The management structure needs to ensure that staffing and resourcing appropriately prioritise children's learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Next steps to improve centre practices include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers being more deliberate in the strategies that they use to engage children and extend their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving the quality of learning environments and resources to help teachers promote children’s exploration, creativity and oral language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing professional development to support the manager's and each teacher's capability growth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing internal evaluation processes that help managers and teachers to improve the quality of learning programmes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing robust, improvement-focused performance management.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Choice Kids Mahia Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practices, managers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>differentiate between policies and procedures and ensure that these are consistently implemented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve supervision in the outdoor learning environment, currently restricted by poorly designed climbing equipment.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>systematic, improvement focused internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a sufficient quantity and variety of indoor and outdoor furniture, equipment and materials</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the extent to which curriculum leadership and implementation reflects an understanding of and is consistent with, current research, theory, and practices in early childhood education.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6,PF4; Education (ECS) Regulations 2008, 43(1a,iii).</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Choice Kids Mahia Road will be within two years.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>31 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><ul>
<li>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</li>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
