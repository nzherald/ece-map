<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Rising Stars Henderson Early Childhood Centre governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the May 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>improvements to the quality of programme planning and implementation, and the learning environment</li>
<li>the extent to which centre managers have improved management practices and self review processes</li>
<li>the extent to which centre management have addressed issues of non-compliance identified in the 2012 report</li>
<li>any other issues relevant to the governance, management and operation of the centre that arise in the course of the review.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Rising Stars Henderson Early Childhood Centre provides full day education and care for children from infancy to school age. The centre was previously separated into two areas, one for children under 3 years and another for those over 3. It operated under two separate licences. In October 2012 the centre was relicensed under the 2008 Early Childhood Regulations and the two centres merged into one under a single licence.</p><p>At the time of the 2012 review, ERO noted that teachers needed to improve their interactions with children and their use of positive guidance. Staff also needed to provide a better planned and resourced learning environment.</p><p>The managers and staff have made significant progress since the 2012 review. Their quick response to address concerns noted in the 2012 report is commendable. There have been some staff changes and a new centre manager has been appointed. Teaching staff are qualified early childhood teachers or are in training.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>Teachers provide a good quality programme. The centre is now much better placed to promote positive outcomes for children. This significant improvement has been helped by the enthusiasm and proactive approach of the owner, centre leaders and staff to improve the quality of education.</p><p>Centre managers provide strong professional leadership and model good teaching practices. Changes to the programme and improvements to the environment and teaching practices have had a beneficial effect on children. Professional development has assisted staff to improve relationships and the quality of the curriculum.</p><p>The centre is family orientated and welcoming. It reflects the teachers&rsquo; commitment to biculturalism and appreciation of children&rsquo;s cultural backgrounds. Respectful and caring relationships between teachers and children encourage children&rsquo;s engagement in the programme. Teachers foster sustained conversations, listen carefully to children and respond to them with warmth and interest. Teachers have high expectations for behaviour and use positive guidance strategies well.</p><p>Children make choices and play purposefully and cooperatively. They explore and make discoveries in a harmonious centre atmosphere. Teachers provide children with many opportunities to learn and engage in sustained play. They encourage children to be curious, take on leadership roles and contribute to routines. The well resourced and carefully planned learning environment shows teachers&rsquo; acknowledgement and respect for the capabilities of children.</p><p>Well documented planning and assessment processes are in place. Teachers are developing a shared understandings of meaningful ways to record how they are noticing and responding to children&rsquo;s interests. Planning is becoming increasingly more focused on extending child initiated learning. Children&rsquo;s individual learning portfolios provide a good record of their learning and development.</p><p>Centre leaders have improved centre management, operation and administration practices. Teachers regularly engage in professional discussions and share information about children. The teaching team works together well and has a shared understanding of centre philosophy, practices and management expectations. Appraisal is being strengthened as a process to guide ongoing improvement to teacher practice. Teachers appreciate the increased emphasis placed on professional development.</p><p>Self-review processes that focus on improving outcomes for children are now established. These processes are collaborative and include multiple perspectives. Parent partnership is strong and managers and teachers work successfully with wh&#257;nau M&#257;ori. There is a high expectation that teachers will be reflective and improvement focused.</p><p>Centre managers have successfully addressed issues of non-compliance raised in the 2012 ERO report. Good systems for monitoring health and safety are now in place.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>The leaders and ERO agree that the areas for further improvement include leaders continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>review and refine the appraisal process to clarify and maintain high expectations of teacher practice</li>
<li>enhance the use of self review to guide ongoing reflection and improvement</li>
<li>strengthen teacher&rsquo;s use of assessment, planning and evaluation to show how children&rsquo;s individual interests are noticed, responded to, and built on over time.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rising Stars Henderson Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.
