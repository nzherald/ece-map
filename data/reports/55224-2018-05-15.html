</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Makauri Rural Kindergarten is adjacent to Makauri School on the outskirts of Gisborne. It opens from 8:30am to 2:30pm Monday to Thursday and 8:30am to 12.45pm on Friday. The service is licensed for up to 40 children aged from two years to school age. Of the 54 children enrolled, four are Māori.</p><p>The centre philosophy emphasises the importance of relationships, sustainability, and problem solving.</p><p>A head teacher oversees operation of the centre. The teaching team is fully qualified and supported by a teacher aide. Over the past three years staff have participated in professional development provided by the Gisborne Kindergarten Association (the association) that has included learning about te ao Māori, working with younger children and assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>Makauri Rural Kindergarten is one of 11 kindergartens governed and managed by the association. Two senior teachers provide professional support and guidance to individual kindergartens. A pouawhina has been appointed on a fixed-term contract to guide kindergartens' implementation of tikanga and kaupapa Māori practices.</p><p>The June 2014 ERO report identified a number of areas requiring review and development at kindergarten level, including: self review; transition; and bicultural practices. Progress is evident. At the association level, strategic self review and review of the implementation of the appraisal process were identified. Progress is ongoing.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the Gisborne Kindergarten Association. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in a play-based programme that promotes authentic and meaningful learning experiences. Intentional teaching builds on their skills and knowledge. A strength of the programme is its emphasis on sustainability and the natural world. Spaces and resources are thoughtfully arranged to offer children opportunities for exploration, challenge, and discovery.</p><p>Planning for children's learning is focused on their individual needs and interests. Whānau and parent aspirations are gathered as part of this process. Teachers and parents work in partnership to develop specific learning goals that align to the three key learning areas underpinning the valued outcomes of the kindergarten's philosophy.</p><p>Staff have developed a sound framework to guide planning for learning that involves teachers gathering a wide range of information. Portfolios are<strong> </strong>useful<strong> </strong>records of children's learning and engagement in kindergarten activities.</p><p>Teachers have been building their knowledge of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori. They demonstrate a genuine commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The programme affirms all children’s identities as bicultural citizens of Aotearoa.</p><p>The team has a shared understanding of what educational success for Māori children looks like in the kindergarten learning environment. Further developing learning partnerships with whānau Māori should enhance responsiveness to children and their families.</p><p>The centre is inclusive of children with additional needs. Established relationships with, and access to support agencies is available, if required.</p><p>A well-considered transition process supports children's entry to school. The kindergarten has developed a strong partnership with the local school. Regular visits help children to become familiar with the school environment.</p><p>A range of collaboratively undertaken reviews, aligned to kindergarten and association priorities for ongoing improvement, emphasise children's learning. A focus of development is strengthening teachers' knowledge of evaluation to support them to know the impact of their actions on children's outcomes.</p><p>Teachers are well supported to develop their practice. There is a strong commitment to growing staff knowledge and skills through ongoing professional learning and the sharing of good practice. Senior teachers regularly identify actions and provoke thinking in relation to children's learning. The newly developed appraisal system, when fully implemented, should strengthen teacher inquiries into their own practice.</p><p>Association leaders have a well-considered approach to progressing strategic objectives. Connections to the community are strong and maintaining these continues to be a focus. Leaders are committed to partnerships and acknowledging Māori as tangata whenua. The association has identified that developing shared understanding of internal evaluation is a priority.  ERO's evaluation confirms this development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten's leaders agree that the priorities are to:</p><ul>
<li>evaluate the effectiveness of the curriculum on outcomes for all children.</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>fully implement the revised appraisal system</li>
<li>continue to develop a shared understanding and use of internal evaluation across all levels of operation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Makauri Rural Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Makauri Rural Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Patricia Davey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>15 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
