</table><p>BestStart Newton is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>BestStart Newton has five rooms, each with access to an outdoor area. The centre is licensed for 136 children, including up to 40 children under two years of age. Downstairs are three rooms for babies (three months to two years), toddlers (two to three years), and older toddlers (approximately three and-a-half years). Upstairs are two preschool rooms (three-and-a-half to five years).</p><p>The centre is part of the BestStart charitable trust. The organisation has re-branded all its early learning services. BestStart provides an overarching governance and management framework to support operations and curriculum delivery in individual centres. Business Managers (BM) and Professional Services Managers (PSM) facilitate staff professional development and provide strategic guidance.</p><p>The curriculum is underpinned by the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, bicultural practices and partnerships with parents/whānau. The centre philosophy emphasises the concepts of whanaungatanga, manaakitanga, hiranga, and aroha, in keeping with the centre's recognition of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><p>The children and staff are from diverse cultural backgrounds. Many of the children are from families that are new to New Zealand. More than half of the children identify as Indian. There are several Māori and Pacific children attending the centre.</p><p>The centre is managed by an experienced manager who was appointed in 2019. She is supported by a curriculum leader who works with all teachers. Each room has a head teacher. The centre employs two van drivers, a cook and an administrator. The van drivers transport some children between their homes and the centre.</p><p>The centre has a positive history of ERO reporting. The 2015 ERO report commented very positively on many aspects of centre operations including the education and care of children, engagement with parents, centre management and building of the capacity and capability of staff. The report confirmed that the centre's focus on strengthening bicultural practice and the support that it offered Māori and Pacific children was appropriate.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the BestStart Upper North Island region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from high quality education and care. Their relationships with their teachers are very affirming and interactions support their wellbeing and learning. Children can make decisions about their play from a wide range of activities and resources on offer.</p><p>Teachers work with parents to design a curriculum that is relevant to the children and their parents' aspirations. They communicate electronically and face-to-face with parents, sharing information about their child. Teachers help parents to understand the New Zealand curriculum approach to early learning through discussions and wall displays.</p><p>Children's cultures are acknowledged and supported in the centre's environment and through curriculum activities. Teachers speak some of the children's home languages and cultural events are celebrated.</p><p>Māori and Pacific children are very well supported in their cultural identity. The staff have successfully strengthened the bicultural approach to the curriculum. All children have opportunities to experience aspects of <span lang="mi">te ao Māori.</span> Teachers use <span lang="mi">te reo Māori</span> within the programme. They continue to build their capability in the language, to understand <span lang="mi">tikanga</span> and to know about the local area from a Māori perspective.</p><p>Children under the age of two years receive high quality care and education in a richly resourced, calm and unhurried environment. Interactions promote children's oral language development. The centre's primary caregiving approach gives parents a key person to communicate with and supports the child's transition to the centre. The home routines of young children are followed at the centre.</p><p>Further developing programme planning and the assessment of children's learning continues to be a focus. Teachers are now using electronic means of sharing their assessment and planning with parents. They are using <em><span lang="mi">Te Whāriki</span></em>, the early childhood curriculum, <em><span lang="mi">Tātaiako</span></em>: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners, and <em><span lang="mi">Tapasā</span></em>: Cultural Competencies Framework for Teachers of Pacific Learners to guide their practice.</p><p>The centre is very well managed and led. Effective evaluation processes and strategic planning promote ongoing improvement. Teachers are supported to build their professional capability effective performance appraisals and relevant professional development. Very good systems for internal evaluation guide and inform teaching and learning which results in improved practices that promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>National, regional and centre operations are guided by strategic and annual plans, and a shared vision which monitor quality and promotes ongoing improvement. These are linked to BestStart strategic goals, which promote a sense of belonging to a wider learning community and support more widespread collaboration amongst teaching teams. Professional learning and development have a focus for building capabilities and has impacted positively on teaching practices. The service provides opportunities for leadership within the team.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre mangers have identified areas for further development. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening planning and assessment by being specific about actions that teachers might take to support children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building the leadership skills of all teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing teachers' bicultural knowledge.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Centre managers have already established indicators of success and plans of action to build on their current practice in these areas. ERO agrees that a focus on these areas is appropriate.</p><p>Agreed next steps for the organisation are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>bicultural understanding and practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>risk analysis management systems, processes and procedures for excursions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appraisal processes to support teachers’ continuum of professional knowledge and practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of BestStart Newton completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>8 May 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
