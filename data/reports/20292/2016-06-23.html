</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Rose Centre Community Pre-School is a well-established service in Belmont, on Auckland's North Shore. It comes under the ownership and management of the Rose Community Centre. The Rose Community Centre Board of Trustees govern and manage the early childhood centre.</p><p>The centre is situated close to a local primary school. This centre is licensed for children from babies up to school age, and offers sessional and full day hours.</p><p>The licensee, centre manager and teachers are all new appointments since the last ERO report in 2013. The centre manager works collaboratively with the board of trustees to provide support and guidance for her team of fully qualified ECE teachers. Team building and professional development programmes have had a positive impact on the programme.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report identified strengths within the learning programme that gave children a strong sense of belonging. These aspects have been maintained by the new teaching team.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy clearly outlines the intentions of the centre to provide an environment that promotes exploration and learning. The teaching team together with board members are working at developing an outdoor playground that will meet the aspirations in their philosophy.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Positive relationships between teachers, children and their parents and whānau are clearly evident. Adults' interactions with children are sensitive and responsive. Children are happy and settle quickly when they arrive. Friendships among children promote imaginative and collaborative play, and the children participate in sustained play for long periods, either independently or with teachers. They have a good sense of ownership of their learning and belonging in the centre.</p><p>The environment is welcoming and attractive and, together with the resources, invites explorations and encourages children’s imaginative play. Teachers take advantage of opportunities to promote numeracy and literacy within the context of children’s play. The outdoor environment promotes physical challenges and explorations. Teachers are aware of the need to renew some of the outdoor equipment and replenish both indoor and outdoor resources. A greater variety of good quality resources would challenge children more fully in their play.</p><p>Teachers work well together and demonstrate a professional understanding of their role. They take a collaborative approach to facilitating smooth transitions for children into and beyond the centre<em>.</em> Teachers create stimulating mat-times for children in which they encourage children to contribute to the wider group. Teachers introduce a variety of activities to acknowledge and address specific interests of children, and include te reo Māori and waiata.</p><p>The programme is inclusive of all children. Teachers’ knowledge of children’s backgrounds contributes to children settling well and being responsive to the programme. Parents are encouraged to share their child’s experiences from home. Teachers share information with families and whānau about the child’s time in the centre in a variety of appropriate ways, including online programme 'Story Park'.</p><p>Some good management systems are in place to support the operation of the centre. The board could strengthen systems through ongoing professional development around their governance and management roles.</p><p>The board members agree with ERO that they need to consider ways to either include parents at board level or establish a management committee so that the affairs of the centre are separate from the general meeting of the Rose Community Centre. This would allow more dedicated time and planning for the centre affairs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The licensee and centre manager are very reflective about how the centre can continue to improve. They agree that in order to improve outcomes for children they should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen assessment practices to ensure that children's progress is more clearly recorded and to show learning and development over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen self-review processes to guide centre improvements, teaching practices and strategic directions more effectively</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen bicultural practices by building teachers' knowledge of and confidence in te reo and tikanga Māori</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The board and centre manager could further strengthen systems, policies and procedures to guide improvements and promote positive outcomes for all children. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing an annual action plan to guide centre to achieve its goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing external professional support to strengthen the centre’s leadership and management capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing appraisal process to better reflect centre's goals, philosophy, job description and Educational Council requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Rose Centre Community Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Rose Centre Community Pre-School will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>23 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
