<p align="left">Jump Start Kids Centre 1 in Mt Albert, Auckland, provides good care and education for children from birth to three years of age. Children are catered for in two separate rooms, one for babies and toddlers, and the other for children up to the age of four years. Older children, up to school age, attend an adjoining centre that is separately licensed.</p>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s 2008 review identified that some good progress had been made towards addressing the concerns identified in the 2006 and 2007 ERO reports in relation to the learning programme, teachers&rsquo; interactions with children, and aspects of self review. Since 2008, new owners have made significant changes in centre operations, including improvements to the centre environment, teachers&rsquo; planning and assessment practices, and programme implementation.</p>
<p align="left">Children and babies benefit from interactions with teachers who are warm, supportive and positive. Teachers recognise children&rsquo;s learning and developmental needs and are guided by babies&rsquo; home routines and by children&rsquo;s interest in the programme. They talk with and engage children in conversation to promote their developing language skills. Children play cooperatively alongside each other and are learning good social skills.</p>
<p align="left">Managers could consider how to provide a programme that supports more open-ended play and extends children&rsquo;s interests beyond the resources and activities that teachers provide for them. They have also identified the need to establish partnerships with parents/wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children, and to support their goals and aspirations for their tamariki in the programme. Centre managers could formalise centre goals within a long-term plan to develop a more strategic approach to self review and ongoing improvements in the operation of the centre.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p align="left">Before the review, the management of Jump Start Kids Centre 1 was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atJump Start Kids Centre 1.</p>
<p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s 2008 review acknowledged the good progress made towards addressing concerns identified in the 2006 and 2007 ERO reports about programme planning and implementation, teachers&rsquo; interactions with children, and aspects of self review. Concerns were also raised about personnel changes that were likely to impact on the rate of progress in improving the centre.</p>
<p align="left">In September 2008, new owners took over the leadership and management of the centre. They established a separately licensed centre in an adjoining facility for children over four years. Jump Start Centre 1 now caters only for children under four years of age.</p>
<p align="left">Although there have been some staff changes since 2008, many teachers have remained at the centre. All teachers are qualified and most are fully registered. In 2009 all teachers participated in Kei Tua o Te Pai professional development to improve centre planning and assessment practices. The owner has refurbished the rooms, upgraded equipment and has improved transitions for children into the centre and between rooms in the centre.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p align="left">Positive relationships and interactions. Children benefit from warm, supportive and positive relationships with adults and with other children. Children&rsquo;s self-esteem and confidence are promoted by teachers, who recognise children&rsquo;s learning, wellbeing and developmental needs and follow babies&rsquo; home routines.</p>
<p align="left">Programme in action. Children play for extended periods of time and babies are well cared for within a programme that:</p>
<ul>
<li>allows children and babies to choose from a variety of resources and activities;</li>
<li>provides experiences that encourage babies&rsquo; physical development and promote the development of their language skills; and</li>
<li>promotes children&rsquo;s literacy and numeracy learning.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Leading and managing change. The owner, who is committed to promoting high quality outcomes for children, has made improvements that are driven by self review and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>providing teachers with a workspace, computer access, non-contact time and regular weekly planning and reflection meetings that help to build a supportive team culture and encourage teachers to plan collaboratively;</li>
<li>providing opportunities for team leaders to further extend their leadership skills;</li>
<li>developing a policy and procedure framework to guide centre operations;</li>
<li>rewriting the centre philosophy with teachers so that understanding and ownership of principles and values are shared; and</li>
<li>implementing a teacher appraisal process.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p align="left">Extending children&rsquo;s interests. Centre managers and ERO agree that the next step for teachers is to provide a programme that is focused on extending children&rsquo;s emerging interests. It would be useful for managers and teachers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>continue to review and resource the environment to support children&rsquo;s opportunities for more open-ended play;</li>
<li>provide opportunities for parents to have input into programme planning; and</li>
<li>promote opportunities for children to write in meaningful contexts throughout the centre and to develop their numeracy skills.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Strategic framework and self review. To support their vision for ongoing improvements, centre managers could develop a long-term strategic plan that outlines goals for the future. They could also develop indicators for quality outcomes and use these to regularly review the extent to which progress has been made.</p>
<a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3>
<p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service;</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children;</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p align="left">Six children are identified by their parents/wh&#257;nau as M&#257;ori.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p align="left">Staff build relationships with tamariki and their wh&#257;nau by:</p>
<ul>
<li>acknowledging in the centre philosophy the place of M&#257;ori as tangata whenua;</li>
<li>reviewing their transition practices to make the centre more welcoming and responsive to parents/whanau; and</li>
<li>incorporating aspects of te reo M&#257;ori into the programme.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p align="left">Managers agree with ERO that managers could now consider ways to:</p>
<ul>
<li>establish partnerships with parents/wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children, find out what goals and aspirations they have for their tamariki, and use these to support programme planning;</li>
<li>identify, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s wh&#257;nau and iwi backgrounds in their portfolios; and</li>
<li>continue to support all teachers to further develop their understanding of te reo M&#257;ori me &#333;na tikanga.</li>
</ul>
<a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Jump Start Kids Centre 1 completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">In order to improve current practice, centre managers should:</p>
<ul>
<li>implement a hazard identification system;</li>
<li>include a protected disclosure clause in the child abuse prevention policy;</li>
<li>strengthen the process for identifying risks on excursions outside the centre; and</li>
<li>ensure that all heavy items are secured in case of an earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<a id="5-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Recommendations</h2>
<p align="left">ERO and the centre managers agree that managers and teachers should continue to:</p>
<div>

<p>To the Parents and Community of Jump Start Kids Centre 1</p>
<p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Jump Start Kids Centre 1.</p>
<p align="left">Jump Start Kids Centre 1 in Mt Albert, Auckland, provides good care and education for children from birth to three years of age. Children are catered for in two separate rooms, one for babies and toddlers, and the other for children up to the age of four years. Older children, up to school age, attend an adjoining centre that is separately licensed.</p>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s 2008 review identified that some good progress had been made towards addressing the concerns identified in the 2006 and 2007 ERO reports in relation to the learning programme, teachers&rsquo; interactions with children, and aspects of self review. Since 2008, new owners have made significant changes in centre operations, including improvements to the centre environment, teachers&rsquo; planning and assessment practices, and programme implementation.</p>
<p align="left">Children and babies benefit from interactions with teachers who are warm, supportive and positive. Teachers recognise children&rsquo;s learning and developmental needs and are guided by babies&rsquo; home routines and by children&rsquo;s interest in the programme. They talk with and engage children in conversation to promote their developing language skills. Children play cooperatively alongside each other and are learning good social skills.</p>
<p align="left">Managers could consider how to provide a programme that supports more open-ended play and extends children&rsquo;s interests beyond the resources and activities that teachers provide for them. They have also identified the need to establish partnerships with parents/wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children, and to support their goals and aspirations for their tamariki in the programme. Centre managers could formalise centre goals within a long-term plan to develop a more strategic approach to self review and ongoing improvements in the operation of the centre.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p>
<p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p>
<p align="left"><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
