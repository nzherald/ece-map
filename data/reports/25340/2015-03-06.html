</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>KiNZ East Tamaki provides full day and sessional education and care for up to 50 children over the age of two years. The centre has a high Māori and Pacific roll. Sixty-seven percent have Pacific heritage and twenty-eight percent identify as Māori. The centre operates from a spacious, purpose-built facility.</p><p>The centre operates under KiNZ, a subsidiary of the Auckland Kindergarten Association. KiNZ provides the framework structures and professional support to guide centre policies and procedures. The centre manager supervises and is responsible for day-to-day centre operations and the teaching team. An assistant manager is responsible for care routines and curriculum implementation. The teachers are a well established team who are experienced and qualified. There is low staff turnover and this has helped build close relationships with families over time.</p><p>The centre philosophy emphasises children learning through play. The philosophy acknowledges the importance of incorporating bicultural practices and cultural diversity into the programme. There is a focus on supporting teacher professional practice to achieve positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Centre leaders have responded positively to the 2012 ERO report and have made ongoing improvements. These include strengthening approaches to growing teacher professional practice and understandings of Pacific cultures.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children receive high quality care and education in an environment that makes good links to their language, culture and identity. Teachers understand the child in the context of their family and whānau. They are very effective at engaging Māori and Pacific children.</p><p>Children are highly engaged in their learning and play. They play for sustained periods of time. Children use their imagination, solve problems and develop complex play experiences. They enjoy warm, respectful relationships with adults and each other. Older children care for younger ones. They act as good examples for younger children to follow. Adults and children work and play well together. The programme has an easy flow.</p><p>Skilled teaching practices facilitate children’s play, language development and engagement in learning. Teachers support children to make independent decisions and plan their play. Children with diverse and additional learning needs are effectively and respectfully supported to participate in the programme. Routines are unobtrusive and unhurried. The cultural values that Māori and Pacific cultures place around food are carefully and appropriately acknowledged.</p><p>Children have easy access to resources and learning opportunities in all areas of play. Learning areas are designed so that there is a flow of play between the indoor and outdoor environments. Children’s opportunities to learn early literacy and numeracy skills are meaningful and authentic. They are encouraged and supported to access different technologies as part of learning and play.</p><p>Teachers plan and assess well in order to extend learning opportunities for children. Children contribute to the planning process. The programme is informed by children’s interests and their inquiries.</p><p>Effective leadership is a prominent feature of the centre. It contributes to positive outcomes for children. Centre leaders have grown a strong and capable professional teaching team. Together they have shared understandings of the high expectations required for their professional practice. Centre leaders value equity and social justice for children and their families. They are committed to providing high quality education. They help promote equity through cross-cultural development and understanding. Centre leaders also provide high levels of support for families to access health and social services so that there are better outcomes for children.</p><p>Centre leaders and staff have a good understanding of self review. They use it to promote ongoing improvements in the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders want to build on the centre’s strengths. They plan to continue seeking relevant ways to deepen teachers’ understanding of a culturally responsive curriculum.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kinz East Tamaki completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kinz East Tamaki will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>6 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
