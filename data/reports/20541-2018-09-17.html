</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kristin School Kindergarten operates in the grounds of a large private school situated on Auckland's North Shore. The service is licensed to provide education and care for up to 50 children aged over two years. Children enrolled are all in the four to five year old age group. They attend daily sessions similar to school hours. Children and their families, many of whom speak more than one language, reflect the cultural diversity of the local community.</p><p>Children are grouped according to their age into four classes of ten children. Each class has its own teacher. The younger children and their teachers occupy one room and the older children and their teachers occupy a separate space. A support teacher works in each room to assist the two class teachers.</p><p>Children in each group transition with their class teacher through the kindergarten and into the Year 0 class at Kristin School. The manager of the kindergarten is also the Year 0 Dean and reports to the Junior School Principal.</p><p>The leaders of the kindergarten are the manager and assistant manager. They work alongside a team of eight other qualified teachers. Some of these teachers work in a support or specialist role in each classroom. The teaching team reflects the diversity of enrolled families.</p><p>The philosophy of the service strongly values the unique qualities of each individual child. Teachers view children as capable and confident learners and strive to provide an environment that allows children to lead their own learning. They have a strong focus on promoting children's oral language development. Teachers foster children's pride in their own cultures and their knowledge of others.</p><p>Kristin School Kindergarten has a very positive reporting history. The 2014 and 2011 ERO reports acknowledged the very good practices evident for promoting children's learning, development and wellbeing, and the positive outcomes of a good quality self-review process. These quality aspects of practice have been sustained.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident explorers of the kindergarten environment. They take purposeful advantage of opportunities provided by their teachers to engage in meaningful and interesting experiences involving mathematics, literacy, science, and information technology. The programme provides a well-considered balance of play-based learning and teacher guided activities.</p><p>Children's learning opportunities are considerably extended through access to specialist teachers in the performing arts, music, language, and the visual arts. Specialist teachers also work with children to preserve and strengthen their knowledge in using their home languages, alongside English language learning. Teachers thoughtfully and skilfully provide opportunities for children to develop and extend their oral language skills.</p><p>Access to an area of bush on the school's extensive grounds supports children's developing knowledge of the natural world, and is seen by teachers as an integral component of the curriculum. Teachers provide numerous opportunities for children to access the varied specialist facilities available in the school. This enhances children's sense of belonging in the wider learning community that surrounds the kindergarten, and very effectively supports the transition of children to the junior school.</p><p>Leaders and teachers know children and their whānau well. They empower children to lead their own learning. Teachers work alongside children to write learning stories on the child's chosen topic and have implemented child led conferences where children share their learning with their parents. Parents who spoke with ERO shared a deep appreciation of the programme provided for their children, how well it aligned to their aspirations for their children's learning and the opportunities for them to be involved in the life of the kindergarten.</p><p>Teachers very successfully integrate the expectations of the <em>International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme</em> and <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, in planning high quality programmes for children. They support children's developing knowledge of the bicultural nature of Aotearoa New Zealand with a deliberate focus on Māori values throughout the programme. A specialised mentor has been appointed to strengthen teachers' knowledge in this area.</p><p>Programme planning is underpinned by evidence-based assessment for individuals and groups of children. The broad curriculum provided by teachers allows children to develop deeper knowledge of themselves and their impact on the world they live in, and builds their knowledge as global citizens. Teachers and leaders have effectively evaluated and redeveloped the curriculum over time, based on sound research. This engagement in deep reflection leads them to continually question and modify their practice and make deliberate, measured decisions to ensure positive outcomes for all children.</p><p>Kindergarten leaders work very effectively together. They know their teachers well. They have established a robust system of appraisal that is strongly based on teachers' inquiries into their own practice. These inquiries are then shared. This highly collaborative process allows the team to evaluate teaching practice as a group. It is supporting the development of shared understanding and implementation of high quality practice across the team.</p><p>The kindergarten works under the strategic plan of Kristin School. Developing some kindergarten specific indicators under the strategic pillars would enable leaders and teachers to map and evaluate their progress in meeting these strategic goals. The purpose of internal evaluation is well understood by the team and is well linked to the strategic pillars of the organisation. The process could be refined with a stronger focus on the evaluative aspects of review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To support and further enhance their current high quality programmes for children, leaders and teachers will continue to focus on the meaningful inclusion of Māori values into everyday teaching practice and key kindergarten documentation.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kristin School Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kristin School Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Information Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>17 September 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
