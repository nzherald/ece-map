</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Activity Room is a licensed early childhood service for children in Christchurch Hospital based within the Hospital Play Specialist service. The service is open Monday to Friday. Its role is to help children and their families make sense of their hospital experience and maintain their wellbeing.</p><p>The Activity Room is part of the Children's Ward within the Canterbury District Health Board hospital. A new hospital block is under construction and will include new premises for The Activity Room and children's wards.</p><p>A team leader is responsible for the daily running of the service. The five Hospital Play Specialists (HPS) are mostly qualified early childhood teachers. One is an experienced registered HPS and is mentoring the others as they work towards gaining HPS registration. They work with children up to the age of 16 and their families on the wards and in the dedicated activity room. The HPS work closely with the health professionals within the child health team. The service is governed by the Canterbury District Health Board.</p><p>The HPS team has had professional development to address the recommendations of the 2012 ERO report relating to planning and self review. As there have been staffing changes since 2012, there is a need to continue developing these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The HPS effectively help children maintain their wellbeing while in hospital and make sense of their hospital experiences. The HPS are skilled in quickly developing trusting relationships with children and their families. This helps to reduce children's and families' anxiety that surrounds the experience of being in hospital.</p><p>The HPS role is complex and requires them to respond quickly to children's changing circumstances. The HPS support children's wellbeing in multiple ways. They:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>work well with individual children and families on the wards and other areas of the hospital to prepare them for clinical interventions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>help children to understand and be involved in the decisions that affect them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strongly advocate for children with health professionals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>educate health professionals about ways to best work with children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>collaborate with the Māori health worker and other social services within the hospital.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Each day the HPS assess every child on the ward, drawing on the knowledge of other health professionals and family members. They use this information to identify which children are most in need of their services for the day. The HPS contribute to positive health outcomes through purposeful individualised planning. For example, when children undergo difficult procedures, HPS prepare children for what to expect and let them handle samples of medical equipment to reduce its strangeness. They have been very successful in lessening the need for general anaesthetics when children undergo MRI scans by carefully planned familiarisation visits.</p><p>The Activity Room itself offers a safe place for children to play. It is a place where the whole family can spend time together. The room is purposefully set out for children of all ages to play and learn, free from medical procedures. The HPS encourage children to express their feelings and come to terms with their hospital experiences. There is a safe space for infants and also activities suitable for siblings and teenagers.</p><p>A new planning model has brought a clearer focus on intended learning for children in The Activity Room. The team recognises this planning is still being embedded.</p><p>The HPS are working towards establishing more culturally sensitive and responsive practices. They have begun to build their understanding of tikanga Māori and acknowledge that this is an area to continue to work on. They are also considering better ways to access support for Pacific families.</p><p>In 2014 an experienced external consultant provided valuable advice to the service. This has helped the leaders and team to write a strategic plan that identifies important and relevant priorities for the future. Operating the service seven days a week remains a long-term goal. The leaders should evaluate and report on progress towards meeting the goals in the plan. The service would be strengthened by streamlining some systems and documentation, and by aligning shared appraisal goals and professional learning with priorities identified in the strategic plan.</p><p>The team leader and HPS mentor are building a cohesive team. The recent process of developing a philosophy statement has led to shared understandings amongst the HPS. A future step is to evaluate how well HPS programmes and practices reflect this philosophy. The team leader fosters a culture of ongoing discussion and reflection amongst the team. The team has identified that it is a challenge to gather parents' views about the way the service operates. They should explore ways to make this happen.</p><p>The team leader and HPS are continuing to develop systems and protocols to build consistency of practice. The HPS take part in extensive professional learning and development and have links with other hospital-based services through the New Zealand HPS Association. The team's understanding of the purpose and process of internal evaluation is still developing.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leaders and ERO agree that it is important to consolidate and embed recent changes at the service. They also agree that key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop their understanding and use of effective internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>align systems including appraisal, professional development, internal evaluation and reporting to the goals of the strategic plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen their bicultural and Tiriti-based practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Activity Room completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Activity Room will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>18 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
