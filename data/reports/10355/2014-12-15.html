</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Gardens ECE is located on Charles Prevost Drive near both Totara Park and the Auckland Botanic Gardens in Manurewa, Auckland. It offers all day education and care for children in a purpose-built centre. It is licensed for a maximum of 70 children, including 20 children up to the age of two years. The centre was previously licensed under two separate licences. These have now been merged into one. Children are accommodated in two age-related rooms and outdoor spaces.</p><p>The service is part of an organisation that, at present, has one other centre close by in Hill Road. These centres are supported by the organisation’s general manager. The organisation's management team provides administrative and professional support. The supervisor at Charles Prevost Drive centre oversees day to day centre management. The staff, consisting of a core team of qualified and experienced teachers has been recently established. Teachers are strengthening their working relationships. The centre provides a high teacher to child ratio.</p><p>The centre caters for a diverse community of mainly local families. The service’s philosophy emphasises a strong partnership between the centre, parents/whānau and children, and reflects the aims of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The centre management have responded positively to recommendations made in the 2011 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre is very inclusive in providing education and care for all children who settle quickly to self chosen activities and are engaged in play throughout the day. Where children require extra specialist support, teachers work closely with the relevant external agencies.</p><p>The programme offers many opportunities for children to participate in rich literacy and science experiences and have exposure to mathematical learning within the environment. Teachers offer group projects to extend some children's interests during formal group times in the morning. Teachers have begun to participate in professional learning and development around extending the interests, dispositions, and skills and knowledge of individual children. Children have opportunities to explore their own interests throughout the day. Children could benefit from teachers reviewing the impact that the formal part of the programme has on outcomes for children.</p><p>Portfolios of children's learning emphasise participation in group activities and mainly identify their gross and fine motor skill development. There is a growing organisation-wide focus on making assessment more individual and identifying children’s personal learning in the stories recorded in portfolios. This more personalised approach should allow teachers to identify a wider variety of children's learning. Teachers will also be able to use this information to help with ongoing planning to extend children's interests.</p><p>The centre management values highly the relationships between children, families/whānau and teachers. Teachers reflect the ethnicities of the community and use their home languages in communication with parents and children. Parents and whānau have many opportunities to participate in centre cultural and educational events. Centre management gather parents' perceptions and their aspirations for their children to further inform centre direction. It could now be useful for teachers to highlight parent aspirations in their child's portfolios.</p><p>Teachers are developing their confidence in implementing te ao Māori. Te reo Māori is increasingly visible within the environment and children willingly lead and participate in waiata. Whānau are invited to contribute to the programme. Teachers are considering further ways of ensuring that the programme reflects parents' desires for their tamariki. Centre managers are continuing to work to establish relationships with local marae and iwi.</p><p>The inviting well resourced indoor and outdoor environments support teaching and learning programmes. The outdoor environment has recently been upgraded. This has enabled management to increase the variety of natural resources and equipment for children to use. Children confidently investigate the new surroundings and especially enjoy the access to water play equipment.</p><p>The under two area has been renamed to represent the growing seed He Kakano. There is a high ratio of teachers to babies and toddlers in the room. Teachers respond positively to children's individual rhythms and collaborate with parents around children's personal routines. Teachers provide appropriate experiences to meet each child's individual age and stage of development. Babies and toddlers have access to their own separate modern outdoor area where they are able to confidently explore the surroundings and develop physically.</p><p>The centre is well managed and well lead. The centre general manager has a clear vision for the centre and is focused on lifting centre performance for the benefit of children and their families. Management systems support ongoing centre improvement. Self review processes could be strengthened by evaluating the results of self review against agreed criteria and identified outcomes for children. As part of the regular review cycle ERO recommends that the teaching team review and define the concepts identified in the centre philosophy and develop indicators of good practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre management team agree that key next steps for improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to strengthen programme planning and ongoing assessment to show individual children’s progress in developing skills, dispositions and knowledge</li>
<li>continuing to develop teacher confidence with implementing Te Ao Māori</li>
<li>implementing the <em>Pasifika Education Plan 2013-2017</em>.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Gardens ECE completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Gardens ECE will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>15 December 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
