</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Balclutha Central is part of the Best Start Early Childhood group. It provides full-day care and education for up to 50 children from birth-to-school age. Children play and learn in two areas. A play space named Poumahaka is for infants and toddlers. The Māta āu area is for older children.</p><p>A centre manager, with the help of an assistant manager, ensures the smooth daily running of the centre. Most of the staff are qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>At the time of the 2014 ERO review, the centre was undergoing extensive building operations and was in the process of merging with a nearby ABC centre. There was an action plan in place to improve many aspects of the centre operations. This review found that the centre has made significant progress in all areas. The centre roll has grown in that time also.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A positive feature of ABC Balclutha Central is the concept of "pay it forward". Leaders and teachers use acts of kindness to develop trusting relationships with children, their families and the wider community. Children and their families benefit from a sense of manaakitanga (caring) and belonging to the centre.</p><p>Teachers listen carefully to children. They take the time to have meaningful conversations with them and find out about their interests and lives beyond the centre. Infants and toddlers benefit from close, nurturing relationships with their teachers. Teachers are responsive to their verbal and non-verbal cues and encourage them to lead their own learning at this very young age. For example, they are invited rather than required to eat when food is provided.</p><p>Teachers work closely with families and agencies to effectively support children with diverse needs. Teachers help other children and their families understand and accept individual children's differences in behaviour and character.</p><p>Children are settled and sustain their involvement in play. They play well together and independently. They confidently make choices about what they want to do and where they want to be. The large outdoor area provides many opportunities for older children to explore and develop their physical skills. Children are becoming familiar with the routines and how to care for the indoor space.</p><p>The centre philosophy has been developed with significant input from families during the centre rebuild. Teachers have outlined what the philosophy means for their teaching practice. They should now expand the philosophy to make clear what is important or valued learning for children at this centre and use it to guide their planning. In the future they should undertake internal evaluation to know how well they are meeting the philosophy in practice.</p><p>Children benefit from a programme where teachers' strengths enrich the range of experiences provided. For example they involve children in:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>learning about food and early literacy and mathematics through baking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>science experiments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>arts and crafts activities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>many outings into the local community.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Older children enjoy a daily programme as part of being ready for starting school. As the teachers' confidence with internal evaluation grows, they will be better able to evaluate how well the daily programme reflects the aims of their philosophy and supports children's learning.</p><p>Teachers are finding ways to build and implement te ao Māori perspectives within the programme. They acknowledge this area is still developing.</p><p>Teachers have participated in professional development to improve planning, assessment and evaluation. This has resulted in a useful system for planning for groups and individuals. Teachers now need to consolidate these systems and make their teaching and intended learning evident. They should strengthen evaluations to show children's progress over time.</p><p>An online programme is becoming a valuable tool for communicating and collaborating with families. The next step is for teachers to more clearly show how they seek and respond to parents' wishes for their children's learning.</p><p>The centre leaders and teachers are well supported by Best Start managers. Best Start managers have set clear expectations and have grown the leadership capabilities of the centre manager and assistant manager.</p><p>There is a useful appraisal system aligned to the Education Council requirements and Best Start expectations. The model would be improved by including an observation component. Centre leaders could also consider a shared appraisal goal for all teachers that links to aspects of the strategic plan.</p><p>The centre manager has effectively helped two teams join together as one. As a team, they have made changes and improvements to the programme through their internal evaluation process. They agree that internal evaluation is an area they need to strengthen.</p><p>This will include using clear indicators to guide the evaluation at all stages and ensuring these are relevant to the evaluation focus.</p><p>A strategic plan is in place to guide the centre's direction. This plan has come from needs identified through internal review processes. The workload and focus of the centre would be made more purposeful and efficient by aligning the goals and actions of the plan, internal evaluation and appraisal to the vision and philosophy of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the centre managers and teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>extend the philosophy to make clear what is valued learning for children at the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to build te ao Māori dimensions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consolidate and strengthen the effectiveness of planning, assessment and internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>align systems such as appraisal and internal evaluation to the strategic plan and philosophy.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Balclutha Central completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Balclutha Central will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>19 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
