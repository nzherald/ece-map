<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2>
<p>Since the 2008 ERO review, a previous staff member has become the licensee, co-owner and head teacher. Under her leadership the new teaching team is providing a high quality Montessori programme for children. Contributing to this are:</p>
<ul><li>a calm, purposeful atmosphere which is reflected in children&rsquo;s engaged and diligent approach to learning</li>
<li>the high level of respect for each other demonstrated by teachers and children</li>
<li>a consistent approach by all staff to managing the curriculum and learning environment for children&rsquo;s benefit.</li>
</ul><p>Children are focused and engaged in their learning. The Montessori philosophy is fully embedded in the programme and is evident in all aspects of the centre&rsquo;s operation.</p>
<p>However, there are some management responsibilities that need to be addressed. ERO, the head teacher and owners agree that they need to implement planned self review covering all aspects of the operation of the centre including the appraisal of staff.</p>
<p>The owners also agree that they need to develop strategic and annual plans to provide direction for the future of the centre.</p>
<p>ERO is requesting an action plan from the centre to show how the recommendations in this report will be addressed.</p>
<p>ERO has offered post-review assistance to help the centre to address the matters raised in this report.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Ashburton Montessori Preschool was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atAshburton Montessori Preschool.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Since the 2008 ERO review, a previous staff member has become the co-owner, licensee and head teacher. The new teaching team has been together for six months. A noticeable feature is the high level of Montessori training amongst staff. The centre&rsquo;s philosophy &lsquo;seeks to cultivate a natural love of learning and inquisitiveness&rsquo; and notes that children&rsquo;s input is valued and respected.</p>
<p>The centre has considered and partially actioned the recommendations of the 2008 ERO report.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<h5>Implementing a Montessori curriculum</h5>
<p>A high level Montessori curriculum is offered to children. This philosophy is fully embedded in all aspects of the programme and the centre&rsquo;s operations. Teachers consistently encourage children to be fully involved in the wide range of mainly Montessori-based activities. Children are carefully tracked against the Montessori record of learning and this information is shared with parents. Children are engaged and purposeful in their learning.</p>
<h5>Literacy and numeracy</h5>
<p>Frequent opportunities exist for children to develop their numeracy and literacy skills. ERO observed children who have developed high levels of literacy and numeracy for their age. A wide range of resources is available and accessible. Children were observed in sustained, concentrated and purposeful activity, with the expectation that they would complete the task before moving onto another learning experience. Older children help younger children with their learning. Children&rsquo;s workbooks demonstrate the progress they make in literacy and numeracy.</p>
<h5>Relationships</h5>
<p>Interactions between and among children and staff are positive and respectful. There is a focus on politeness and good manners which assists with the smooth running of the day.</p>
<p>ERO observed children playing well together, sharing resources and showing a genuine interest in the well-being of each other. Teachers model the expected behaviours and emphasise the importance of valuing the work of others. Children display a high sense of belonging and empowerment in the centre environment.</p>
<h5>Encouraging independence</h5>
<p>Children demonstrate independence and well established self-management skills. They participate in a free choice programme within a structured environment. They accept responsibility for keeping the indoor area neat and tidy. Children know to return the resources to the appropriate storage area when they have completed an activity. Children are encouraged to self manage throughout the day, particularly at mealtimes.</p>
<h5>Information for parents</h5>
<p>Parents are provided with relevant and helpful information about the progress of their child. Learning stories in portfolios, together with the child&rsquo;s workbook, provide a good record of the progress made. Comprehensive written reports on their child&rsquo;s progress in social skills and other elements of the Montessori curriculum are provided for parents. Parents are also offered the opportunity of an interview with teachers.</p>
<p>At the end of a child&rsquo;s time at the centre, a very detailed report is written by staff for the parent to take to the child&rsquo;s primary school. Feedback from schools demonstrates that these reports are found to be very useful documents.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<h5>Self review</h5>
<p>Self review is in the early stages of development. The philosophy statement has not been discussed and reviewed since the new teaching team has come together. While there is a three year cycle of policy review, self review as a tool for improvement is not well understood. The centre does not have a robust process for the appraisal of staff nor is there a process for the appraisal of the head teacher/manager/owner. While some staff have continued their study for qualifications there is not yet a planned programme of professional development.</p>
<p>Programme evaluation is not a regular procedure undertaken by staff.</p>
<h5>Operational planning</h5>
<p>While there has been some informal discussion, there is not a documented strategic or annual plan to guide the operation of the centre.</p>
<p>The centre has yet to develop a policy and procedures to manage during times of emergency. This policy should be developed in consultation with and made well known to parents.</p>
<h5>Programme planning, assessment and evaluation</h5>
<p>There are clear links between the Montessori curriculum and programmes for children. How the programmes and outcomes for children are linked to Te Wh&#257;riki, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum is not documented. There is little evidence of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in the environment or in the programme, although this was a recommendation in the previous ERO report.</p>
<a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Ashburton Montessori Preschool completed an ERO <span>Centre Management Assurance Statement</span> and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2>
<p>ERO and the centre managers agree that:</p>
<div><ol><li>
<p>the licensee and staff should develop a process of strategic and annual planning to guide the future development and operation of the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the licensee needs to develop a robust system of a cycle of planned self review. This new system should include a rigorous appraisal process for the manager and teachers. An outcome from this process should be an appropriate programme of professional development aimed at improving outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the head teacher and staff should give consideration to how they will make clear the links between the Montessori philosophy and Te Wh&#257;riki.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<p>ERO is requesting an action plan from the centre indicating how the matters raised in this report are to be addressed.</p>

<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-ashburton-montessori-preschool" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Ashburton Montessori Preschool</h2>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Ashburton Montessori Preschool.</p>
<p>Since the 2008 ERO review, a previous staff member has become the licensee, co-owner and head teacher. Under her leadership the new teaching team is providing a high quality Montessori programme for children. Contributing to this are:</p>
<ul><li>a calm, purposeful atmosphere which is reflected in children&rsquo;s engaged and diligent approach to learning</li>
<li>the high level of respect for each other demonstrated by teachers and children</li>
<li>a consistent approach by all staff to managing the curriculum and learning environment for children&rsquo;s benefit.</li>
</ul><p>Children are focused and engaged in their learning. The Montessori philosophy is fully embedded in the programme and is evident in all aspects of the centre&rsquo;s operation.</p>
<p>However, there are some management responsibilities that need to be addressed. ERO, the head teacher and owners agree that they need to implement planned self review covering all aspects of the operation of the centre including the appraisal of staff.</p>
<p>The owners also agree that they need to develop strategic and annual plans to provide direction for the future of the centre.</p>
<p>ERO is requesting an action plan from the centre to show how the recommendations in this report will be addressed.</p>
<p>ERO has offered post-review assistance to help the centre to address the matters raised in this report.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2>
<h3>About ERO</h3>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
