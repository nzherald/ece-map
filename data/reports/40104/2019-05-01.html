</table><p>Opotiki Rose Garden Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Opotiki Rose Garden Preschool is a community-based service governed by a charitable trust with a board of nine trustees. The centre provides all-day education and care for children in three aged-based settings for infants, toddlers and preschool. The service is licensed for 37 children and has a current roll of 55. This includes 36 Māori and 15 Pākehā children. The centre’s staff is made up of one administrator, a head teacher/manager and five teachers with early childhood qualifications, one primary school qualified kaiāwhina. The service is located near the town centre and operates from 8.30am to 2.45pm Monday to Friday.</p><p>The aim of the service's philosophy is to 'create a culture of kindness which values and honours each unique tamaiti and their whānau. The freedom and aroha they experience will endeavour to guide each tamaiti to realise who they are and that they are active members of our world'.</p><p>Since the previous ERO report in 2016 the head teacher continues in her role and some new teachers have been appointed. The board chairperson also continues in her position and several trustees are new to their governance roles. In addition, recent building developments have been undertaken to provide a specific area for infants up to the age of two years.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from responsive and caring interactions with teachers that nurture their learning and wellbeing. Teachers skilfully notice opportunities to become involved with children’s play and exploration and purposefully extend their ideas and language. Children are provided with choices for learning and teachers respect their decisions about the management of daily care routines. These routines are well managed and used as contexts for authentic learning, such as building independence and taking responsibility.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well catered for, however, there is a need to establish documented guidelines to ensure processes for inclusion are clear.</p><p>Children up to the age of two enjoy a calm and comfortable space to explore. They are valued and trusted as capable learners. Teachers' interactions with infants are unhurried and attentive, and meaningful attachments foster a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>The curriculum effectively promotes positive outcomes for children. Teachers know their children well and meet regularly to plan a programme in response to children's interests and strengths. Children are able to take risks and experience physical challenge in closely monitored settings. They are able to choose from a range of open-ended resources to use their imagination, experiment and explore their ideas. Literacy and mathematical concepts are integrated across the curriculum and supported through a range of play-based activities and experiences. Teachers acknowledge the need to strengthen the curriculum to further reflect the language, culture and identity of Māori children.</p><p>Leadership is providing clarity of direction for teachers and actively gather and respond to parent and community voice. Leaders and teachers are focused on building professional capability. Teachers reflect on the effectiveness of their practice with a focus on improving outcomes for children and engagement with whānau. External professional learning and development has led to a unified approach to teaching and learning. Self review is contributing to ongoing developments to the centre environment.</p><p>Parents feel welcome in the centre. They appreciate the open-door policy and are supportive of current initiatives that encourage partnerships between the service and whānau.</p><p>The board of trustees are representative of the local community and bring a range of relevant skills and experiences to their roles. They receive regular reports from the head teacher which they use to make informed decisions about priorities and direction for the service. Strategic and annual planning require further clarity and development to support a coherent approach to centre development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To continue with progress made in the service for children since the previous ERO review, the following next steps have been identified:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen the centre's curriculum to further reflect the language, cultural and identity of Māori children and whānau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop policy and procedural guidelines about how the service includes and caters for children with additional learning needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review strategic and annual planning to ensure:</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>specific, time referenced annual goals</li>
<li>greater clarity about expected improvements in outcomes for children</li>
<li>a foundation for ongoing reporting and review throughout the year.</li>
</ul>
</ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Opotiki Rose Garden Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and management policies and procedures. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>systematically review all policies and procedures to ensure they are current and reflect best practice</li>
<li>review appointment policy and procedures to ensure adequate checking of Workforce, including background checks and the sighting of certified or original documents <br><em>[Vulnerable Children Act 2014].</em></li>
</ul><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>1 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
