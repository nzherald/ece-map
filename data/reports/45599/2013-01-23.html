<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The Faculty of Education Early Childhood Centre is well placed to embed newly established practices and to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The centre reopened in new premises in January 2011 on the Epsom Campus of the University of Auckland. This is the first ERO review of the service since these changes occurred.</p><p>The centre continues to cater for children of university staff, students and the local community. Separate programmes are provided for infants/toddlers and older children. It is governed in conjunction with six other early childhood centres operated by the University of Auckland. An early childhood reference group and manager oversee and support the centre manager and teachers. Further support is provided by a parent liaison group who organise centre events, participate in self-review processes and contribute to decision making.</p><p>The multicultural teaching team are all registered teachers. They develop programmes influenced by philosophies that emphasise respectful relationships and the provision of high quality learning environments. The centre&rsquo;s roll is culturally diverse and includes 12 M&#257;ori children. Teachers are committed to providing a bicultural dimension in learning programmes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are enthusiastic and confident in the centre. They are viewed as competent learners and have good opportunities to make decisions about their play, including their involvement in group activities. Teachers share respectful relationships with children and listen well to their ideas and contributions. Children benefit from opportunities to take learning risks and explore physically challenging equipment. Older children enjoy extended learning through daily participation in an &lsquo;Enquiry Club&rsquo;. This enables them to practise group skills, problem solving and more complex thinking. In this environment children are articulate and show a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>The programme for infants and toddlers is a positive feature of the centre. Teachers actively implement the Pikler and Gerber philosophies in a calm and unrushed setting. These young children are supported to make choices about their learning and enjoy individualised routines that respect their preferences. Toddlers independently access the outdoor environment and are trusted to make their own discoveries. Infants are happy, settled and secure.</p><p>Teachers skilfully support children&rsquo;s involvement in play. They engage children in meaningful conversations and foster collaborative group activities. They are responsive to individual strengths and interests, and are sensitive to changing needs as children transition through the centre and on to school. Teachers have established effective strategies for assessing children&rsquo;s learning and provide extensive reports to parents each year that show progress against centre learning goals. Eportfolios are also efficient tools for letting parents and families know about children&rsquo;s achievements.</p><p>Programme planning and evaluation systems are in the early stages of development. Ongoing professional development will support managers to build effective systems that enhance programme delivery and teaching practices.</p><p>Children and teachers benefit from the effective leadership of an experienced centre manager. He is well respected by staff and parents who appreciate his collegial practices and promotion of leadership opportunities in the centre. Teachers are encouraged to develop innovative practices, engage in ongoing professional development, and to use the appraisal process for improvement purposes. The University Early Childhood Manager recognises and values the quality of leadership in the centre and provides appropriate support to foster initiative and challenge. The very positive customer satisfaction results in a recent survey justify the high trust placed in centre management systems.</p><p>Centre management is guided by extensive strategic and annual plans. Managers have been responsive to the multiple stakeholders in the centre, finding appropriate ways for parents to have a voice in decision making. They have very positive relationships with the Parent Liaison Group and welcome families&rsquo; involvement in the programmes.</p><p>Managers could now strengthen the rigour of self-review processes by clearly evaluating and documenting the outcomes of centre goals and action plans. Steps should also be taken to ensure teacher appraisals are well aligned with the registered teacher criteria.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Faculty of Education Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>23 January 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
