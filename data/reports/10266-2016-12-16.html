</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mataliki Tokelau Akoga Kamata is a well established Tokelauan community based centre that provides education and care for children from birth to school age. The centre's bilingual setting has a strong emphasis on promoting Te Gagana Tokelau (Tokelau language) and Aganuku Tokelau (Tokelau culture). Underpinned by Christian values and a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi, the akoga reflects the diversity of its community. Most of the children who attend are of Tokelau, Māori, or other Pacific backgrounds.</p><p>The akoga was the first licensed Tokelau language early childhood centre in New Zealand and is governed by the Mataliki Tokelau Pre-School South Auckland Trust Board. Founding members have led the continued development of the akoga vision and educational direction over many years. They have worked with parents and the wider Tokelau community to establish and upgrade the centre's purpose-built property.</p><p>Following the recent retirement of the long-serving supervisor, the board has appointed a new leadership team of two supervisors and a business manager to lead the centre's daily operations. The founder, who is the manager and cultural advisor, continues to manage the overall vision and strategic direction. The board has managed the recent major building extensions well. An administrator, caretaker and teachers are actively involved with the Tokelau community and their vision for the akoga.</p><p>ERO's 2013 report noted strong, trusting relationships with children and whānau, and collaborative management. Robust self review had been established and there was a strong focus on continual improvement. The board and staff have made very good progress in addressing ERO's 2013 recommendations. These included developing a curriculum to better support children's learning, and strengthening internal evaluation. These aspects continue to be an ongoing commitment for the board and staff.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy of Mataliki Tokelau Akoga Kamata is strongly evident in the programme provided for children. The teachers' commitment to promoting Tokelau identity, language and culture provides a place of belonging for children, parents and whānau. Parents and the wider community have reviewed the philosophy to ensure it reflects the centre's vision and mission for children's learning.</p><p>Children participate confidently and are empowered to make choices in the programme. Tuakana/teina relationships help children to develop leadership roles. They enjoy these responsibilities during lotu, helping others when participating in daily routines.</p><p>Teachers are a positive enthusiastic team and have high expectations of children. Children know their ideas are meaningful and valued. They are active participants in their learning as they work independently or in small groups. Children interact well with teachers who support their choices. Most of the teachers are fluent in Tokelau and model this well for children.</p><p>The centre's curriculum is responsive to children's languages and cultures. Teachers promote physical activity, science, art, music, imaginative play as well as literacy and numeracy. The spacious new environment are well organised and offer a good range of learning opportunities for children. There are specific areas for children to explore in the indoor and outdoor environments. Children understand the centres routines and teachers' expectations. Most of the older children are becoming independent and work alongside others to support the daily routines.</p><p>High quality group planning shows teacher collaboration and includes very good quality evaluation of the programme planning. Teachers have developed a shared understanding of internal review, reviewed many areas of the programme and made improvements for children. Their reflections and programme evaluations show their understanding of children's developing interests over time. The 'ika' framework for evaluation provides good evidence of improvements to teaching and learning. Teachers could now use this process to strengthen their planning to extend individual children's interests.</p><p>Parents are encouraged to participate in the learning programme. Their perspectives are valued and affirmed through formal and informal discussions. Many parents contribute to their child's learning records.</p><p>The akoga is well managed by a committed team who share a strong vision for improvement. The board and leaders have catered well for the recent change in the leadership structure. Good systems and accountability processes ensure policies and procedures are implemented and legislative requirements are met.</p><p>There are good opportunities for growing leadership in the akoga, including for parents and children. An appraisal process, clearly articulated in Tokelau and English, promotes teacher reflection and improved practice. Leaders plan to use the Ministry of Education resource <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em>, to strengthen teachers' capability and bicultural practice. There are good operational guidelines for the board members, who continue to look for ways to improve and strengthen their performance.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The board and leaders agree that key next steps could include strengthening how teachers:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>extend and document individual children's learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cater for complexity and challenge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use internal evaluation to guide ongoing improvements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mataliki Tokelau Akoga Kamata completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mataliki Tokelau Akoga Kamata will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>16 December 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
