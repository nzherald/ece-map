<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Tui Early Learners Young Investigators is situated in central Palmerston North. The centre provides care and education for up to 28 children over two years old, from diverse cultures and backgrounds. The service, formerly known as Ready Steady Go, commenced operation under a new licence in August 2011.</p><p>It is managed by the Tui Early Learners management group and is one of five centres managed by this organisation. This is the first ERO review under the new ownership.</p><p>A new head teacher, appointed in July 2012, is well supported in the role by the education leader and centre owner. Significant improvements have taken place in the learning environment and programmes over the past year under new leadership. Refurbishment of the building has created a stimulating environment with good access and easy flow for children&rsquo;s learning and interactions. The external environment with extensive planting, challenging play structures and cultivated gardens encourages exploration and the values of sustainability. A culture of ongoing improvement is promoted by the centre owner and education leader.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>An overarching child-centred philosophy guiding teaching and learning is reflected in practice. Children are encouraged to take on challenges, form positive relationships, and care for and learn from the natural world.</p><p>A welcoming tone invites parents to be part of a community of learners. Parents and wh&#257;nau are encouraged to take an active role in their child&rsquo;s learning and are regularly involved in aspects of the programme.</p><p>The centre's curriculum is closely aligned to <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Staff work collaboratively to respond to group and individual children&rsquo;s emerging needs and interests. A project approach is used to extend children&rsquo;s involvement and add depth to learning through links to science, technology and the creative arts. Responsive, flexible routines and interactions support children's engagement in sustained and purposeful play.</p><p>Literacy and numeracy are actively promoted in the context of play. Teachers effectively encourage and support children to explore, think, and expand on their working theories by listening and questioning. Children lead their own learning and are well supported by teachers. Children&rsquo;s expression of ideas is encouraged and respected.</p><p>Centre programmes and operations support a flexible transition process, for new children and for those leaving, that suits different children&rsquo;s needs. Transitions out to school are well supported by prior visits to a local school.</p><p>Teachers use a range of strategies to promote bicultural perspectives and respond to the cultures, languages and identities of all children. Appropriate resources, displays and practices that reflect te ao M&#257;ori, assist children to develop knowledge and understanding of their dual heritage. The head teacher actively promotes and models te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori across the centre. A growing centre commitment to developing practices to support diverse learners is evident.</p><p>Teachers participate successfully in a range of professional learning and development activities and programmes, focused on improving teaching practice. Centre leaders use a range of tools and processes to effectively develop the capacity and confidence of staff. Collaborative ways of working are fostered to improve practice and outcomes for children.</p><p>The education leader and centre owner provide ongoing support, guidance and feedback to educators through a well-integrated performance improvement framework. This is supported by the use of professional portfolios linked to professional learning and development initiatives and appraisal goals.</p><p>Self review practices are developing. Leaders are beginning to involve wh&#257;nau in planned review of provision for M&#257;ori learners&rsquo; success.</p><ul>
<li>Next steps for teacher development have been identified in relation to <em>Ka Hikitia - Managing for Success: The M&#257;ori Education Strategy 2008-2012</em> and <em>T&#257;taiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of M&#257;ori Learners</em> to inform practice. Leaders identify the review of this area as a priority.</li>
</ul><p>To strengthen self review and planning across the centre, leaders in consultation with staff and parents should develop:</p><ul>
<li>annual plans, goals and strategies to achieve these</li>
<li>policies, expectations and guidelines to monitor and evaluate professional practices relating to curriculum planning, teaching, learning and assessment.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Tui Early Learners Young Investigators completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie&nbsp;(Acting)</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><p>12 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
