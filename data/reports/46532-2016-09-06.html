</table><p>The centre owner and teachers have developed very positive relationships with children and their whānau that contribute to a calm and settled environment. They would now benefit from external support to further build their capability to develop and implement a programme that is responsive to extending children's learning.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>TnT Kidscare is a privately owned full-day early childhood service located in a refurbished office building in Hamilton's central business district. The centre was opened in September 2014. It aims to provide care and education for children from birth to school age in a mixed-age setting. The centre is licensed for 15 children, including six under the age of two years. Its roll of 34, includes 14 Māori children. A feature of the roll is the significant number of children who attend on a casual part-time basis. The centre owner undertakes the position of centre manager. Since the centre was opened there has only been one change to the teaching staff.</p><p>The centre's philosophy specifies a commitment to providing a service where children are able to explore, develop and to have fun.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of TnT Kidscare.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre owner has undertaken a variety of roles as an early childhood teacher. She demonstrates a commitment to providing low child-to-teacher ratios to support positive outcomes for children. Strength of the centre is the positive and meaningful relationships that have been established among the centre owner, teachers, children and their whānau. These relationships support a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging for children. A useful policy framework has been developed to guide centre operations. A challenge for the centre owner and teachers is to maximise the limited play spaces and outdoor areas available in the centre. Priority should be given to increasing children's access to high quality resources and equipment.</p><p>Children participate in a programme that is a combination of child-initiated and teacher-led activities. Literacy learning is well supported by children having access to books, writing materials and opportunities to sing well-known songs. Individual children's portfolios provide a well-presented record of children's involvement in the programme.</p><p>Children's learning is enhanced by visits into the local and wider community. There are also opportunities for whānau and community members to share their knowledge and expertise with children. Whānau appreciate the many opportunities that the centre provide to enable them to come together and celebrate special occasions.</p><p>Māori children's language, culture and identity is recognised and celebrated by the daily use of karakia before meals, singing of waiata and teachers' use of te reo Māori in their daily interactions with children.</p><p>Children benefit from caring and affirming relationships with their teachers. ERO observed teachers actively participating alongside children. This involvement contributes to the centre's calm and settled environment. One teacher was particularly effective in extending children's thinking and problem-solving skills. Teachers are responsive to children's care needs. They have benefited from recent externally provided professional learning and development that has strengthened their understanding of programme planning. Priority should be given to consistently implementing teaching practices that guide and support children's learning and behaviour.</p><p>While there is a separate area for children under the age of two, the children also enjoy many opportunities to play and learn alongside their older siblings and peers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next step for the centre is to strengthen centre leadership of learning. Priority should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>building teacher capability by developing and implementing clear expectations for effective teaching practices that link to the centre's philosophy and support positive learning outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop assessment and planning practices to support teachers to more effectively respond to children's learning and emerging interests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing an environment and resources that foster children's creativity, and opportunities to explore, add complexity and challenge to their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing effective self-review processes to strategically guide centre improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of TnT Kidscare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a</p><p>potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to personnel management and premises and facilities. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implementing a regular system of teacher appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>providing a sufficient variety of good quality learning resources that appropriately supports the ability levels of all children.</li>
</ul><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7,PF4]</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of TnT Kidscare will be within two years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>6 September 2016</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
