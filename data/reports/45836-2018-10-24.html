</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Island Bay Childcare provides all-day education and care for children aged six months to five years, in three separate rooms. It is licensed for 106 children, including 21 up to the age of two. Of the 121 children currently enrolled, five are Māori and over 21 ethnicities are represented.</p><p>The centre mission statement is to 'prepare children for life by empowering them to grow as individuals and develop a love of life and learning'. The philosophy promotes a holistic approach to learning within a stimulating and challenging environment in partnership with families.</p><p>The centre is privately owned and is part of the Wellington Childcare group. The licensee and a centre director oversee the service, with day-to-day operation delegated to a centre manager. Room leaders have responsibility for the curriculum. At the time of this review, changes within the leadership team are underway. Most teachers are fully qualified, with many working towards full certification.</p><p>The November 2015 ERO report identified many areas for continued development to improve outcomes for children. These included: identifying the role of the teacher in extending learning; defining expectations of quality interactions; strengthening assessment and planning; building evaluation capacity; and improving the appraisal process. Progress has been made in all of these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children over the age of two are highly engaged in a mixture of teacher and child-led activities. The well-resourced environment encourages exploration and challenge. Children demonstrate a sense of belonging in the centre.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are cared for within their own dedicated space, by respectful teachers. Their independence and self-care skills are fostered. Teachers should reflect on how the environment and resources could be better used to promote these children's exploration and engagement.</p><p>The bicultural curriculum is developing. Leaders have identified that strengthening the use of meaningful te reo Māori is an area for further improvement. Additional consideration should be given to how visible te ao Māori is within the environment and documentation.</p><p>Teachers know children well and work at their level. Some teachers use a range of strategies to extend children's thinking. Staff continue to explore what high quality interactions look like within the context of their service. This should promote increased consistency across the teaching team.</p><p>Teachers are committed to establishing connections to each child's culture, language and identity. They work collaboratively to create an inclusive environment. This is supported through strong relationships with parents, who contribute to the curriculum and regularly share aspirations for their children. Teachers should continue to seek ways to ensure all children's cultural connections are visible within their learning.</p><p>Understanding of strategies that promote success for Māori children as Māori are developing. Furthering the relationship with local iwi should enable strengthening of a curriculum connected to the area. A next step is to foster a deeper understanding of te ao Māori knowledge and concepts within the context of the centre to support the curriculum.</p><p>Leaders have identified the need to investigate and use strategies that build educational success for Pacific children.</p><p>Assessment and planning for individual children effectively progresses their learning over time. Parents' aspirations inform goal setting and teachers plan how these can be met. Profile books document children's interests, strengths and progress towards their goals. Group planning provides a room-wide focus. A key next step is to strengthen evaluation to see how well planned teaching strategies contribute to intended outcomes.</p><p>Teachers are very well supported to grow their practice. Newly qualified teachers are effectively mentored towards full registration. Recent changes to the appraisal system provide an increased focus on developing practice to improve outcomes for children. Appropriate professional learning opportunities and ongoing collegial discussions progress centre goals.</p><p>Centre leaders are improvement focused and committed to promoting emerging leadership amongst the team. Strengthened organisational systems and processes support the ongoing operation and viability of the centre. Collaborative self review leads to well informed changes in practice. Building teacher capacity to evaluate how these actions improve outcomes for children, against indicators of high quality practice, is a next step.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified that the key next steps are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>promote infants' and toddlers' exploration and engagement through the learning environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the bicultural curriculum and its visibility within the service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and implement strategies that promote educational success for Māori and for Pacific children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build a shared understanding of evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Island Bay Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practice the service provider should ensure that sleep room layout and practice ensures adequate supervision of sleeping children.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Island Bay Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>24 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
