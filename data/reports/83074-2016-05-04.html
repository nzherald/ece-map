</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Big River Educare is a privately owned centre in the town of Balclutha. The centre provides full-day education and care for up to 62 children from birth to school age. Children are grouped in three areas. The Caterpillar area provides for infants and toddlers. The Butterfly and Monarch areas are for the older children. Children may attend for full or part-time hours.</p><p>The owner, a registered teacher, is committed to employing qualified teachers or teachers in training. There has been very little staff turnover at the centre and many of the staff are long serving.</p><p>The centre provides a very spacious outdoor area that reflects the semi-rural lifestyle of the Balclutha district. There are strong links with the local community. The owner and teachers have improved self review and long-term planning as recommended in the 2013 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The owner, teachers and parents have thought carefully about what they want their children to learn, and the values they want their children to have through their experiences in the centre. The centre vision is for children to have "a strong sense of identity as successful and confident learners as they actively participate in their learning journey."</p><p>The centre vision and values are strongly evident in practice. There is a culture of collaboration between teachers, children, parents and whānau. Children have a strong sense of belonging/turangawaewae and are supported to become independent learners. Teachers and children have genuine conversations with each other. Children's ideas, interests and family experiences are listened to carefully and teachers draw on these when planning for their learning. Teachers value parents' wishes for their children and take these into account in planning and assessment practices.</p><p>Teachers have developed and use very effective systems and processes for planning for individuals and groups of children. Teachers make increasing use of ICT to plan collaboratively for all children and are very clear about the learning they are supporting. As part of growing leadership within the team, a new initiative has been to appoint a leader to oversee children’s profiles for consistency of quality. It would be worth developing indicators of best practice to guide her judgements.</p><p>The programme is based on the principles and strands of Te Whāriki, the early childhood curriculum. Children benefit from a rich and varied programme that includes many opportunities for:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>gardening and taking care of the natural world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>exploration through physical challenges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>creativity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>numeracy and literacy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learning skills to establish and maintain friendships.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children have many opportunities to learn about the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. Through ongoing professional development, teachers are increasing the use of te reo and tikanga Māori. They are deepening their understanding of kaupapa Māori concepts and use these as a foundation for their programmes.</p><p>Children play and learn in well-organised and well-resourced play areas. The indoor and outdoor spaces appeal to a wide range of interests. The areas are arranged so children can freely choose what they want to do. Teachers have organised the routines of the day so children are able to spend sustained periods of time at their activities.</p><p>Older children are well supported as they prepare to start school. There is a separate session four mornings a week where four-year-old children can extend their interests, be challenged and take on leadership roles.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from a programme that is calm, relaxed and unhurried. Teachers encourage them to freely explore their environment. Teachers are skilled in the way they:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>respond to infants' and toddlers' individual care needs and talk about what is going to happen next</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>interpret and respond to infants' non-verbal cues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build toddlers' emerging language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>communicate with families about the learning and development of their young children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The owner and leaders have developed effective systems and practices to support the vision, positive culture and sound governance of the centre. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a regularly reviewed policy framework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a focus on building teacher capability through effective professional development and on-going appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a culture of trust and collaboration between the teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>high expectations fostered by the owner. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>The owner has recently sought external advice to improve the quality and usefulness of the strategic plan. When she reviews this plan, she should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>align kaupapa Māori concepts to the core values</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>determine which are the most important priorities at this time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop, implement and evaluate specific planning to ensure priorities are achieved and reported</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>align other related systems such as appraisal goals to the priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The owner needs to ensure she monitors the centre progress towards the vision, goals and valued outcomes.</p><p>The owner and leaders have taken a strategic approach to developing self-review practices in the centre. Self review has improved decision making about aspects of governance, centre programmes and teaching practice. It is effectively embedded across all aspects of the centre and is used in an ongoing and responsive way.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner and ERO agree the key next steps are to continue to build on and extend the good practices in the centre.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Big River Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Big River Educare will be in four years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>4 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
