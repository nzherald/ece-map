</table><p>Kimberley Childcare Greenlane is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kimberley Childcare Greenlane is one of two services owned by the Kimberley Housing Charitable Trust. The centre moved to new premises in 2018. It is licensed for up to 47 children, including a maximum of 20 under two years of age.</p><p>A trust board representative liaises with the regional manager, who has oversight of the two services. The Greenlane centre manager works with four other registered teachers and some unqualified staff to implement programmes for children.</p><p>The centre has separate indoor and outdoor facilities for infants and toddlers, and those over two years of age. At times during the day, teachers create opportunities for mixed-age play to support children's transition through the centre.</p><p>The Kimberley services' philosophy is values based, reflects the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and includes recognition of the Treaty of Waitangi. It includes a focus on relationships, inspiring environments and support for children's social, emotional, spiritual and intellectual development.</p><p>ERO's 2016 report identified many positive practices and next steps that included building leadership capability, deepening internal evaluation and strengthening teacher appraisal processes. Very good progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy a high quality, well-resourced learning programmes in both areas. Teachers engage actively and positively with children, and plan learning opportunities that respond well to children's strengths and interests. In both areas, children are encouraged to be physically active and enjoy outdoor play. The programme is well documented and records are displayed, allowing children to revisit their learning.</p><p>High ratios of adults to children support quality provision for infants and toddlers. Staff provide gentle and nurturing care and support that encourages these younger children to explore their surroundings. Stimulating resources and activities help children to gain confidence in their environment and in their interactions with others. Children transition smoothly from the infant area to the area for older children.</p><p>Children's learning records reflect their development over time and their emerging dispositions. In particular, teachers promote children's curiosity, perseverance and creativity. They set up activities and equipment that support children to learn both independently and alongside others. Children sustain their play, and are confident to ask teachers for equipment that results in more complex and challenging play. Teachers should ensure that the wording of the philosophy statement clearly articulates the value of learning through play.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families well, respecting their cultural backgrounds and parents' aspirations. Teachers encourage each other to strengthen the use of te reo and tikanga Māori through their greetings, comments, mat time activities and in waiata. Teachers build children's awareness of cultural diversity through the selection of appropriate resources and cooperative play. Some teachers are able to use home languages to respond to children from diverse backgrounds.</p><p>Teachers meet regularly to plan and evaluate the learning programme. They make good use of learning stories to develop and respond to children's current interests.</p><p>The staff have worked together for some years and operate well as a team. They have benefitted from ongoing professional development, the leadership provided by centre and regional managers, and the role modelling and expertise of the curriculum leader.</p><p>Staff appraisal processes have been a focus of development in recent years. Teachers are developing inquiry skills as a result of planned professional learning and development. The focus on gathering evidence through the teacher appraisal process, is helping teachers to reflect on their own practices and knowledge of <em>Te Whariki</em>. A centre-wide culture of internal evaluation has been strengthened as a result of teachers' inquiry and reflection.</p><p>The trust board's vision, mission statement and strategic planning are clearly articulated and documented, and include guidelines for monitoring and measuring progress. The board supports ongoing professional development for leaders and teaching staff, and takes an interest in staff wellbeing. Policies are regularly reviewed, although the process could be more strategically aligned.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Agreed next steps for centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to investigate practices that support children's transition to school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to build managers' and teachers' understanding and practice in improvement focused evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kimberley Childcare Greenlane completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>2 August 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
