<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Central Kids Kindergartens - Fordlands governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the October 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>self-review practices</li>
<li>kindergarten leadership</li>
<li>consultation with families and the community</li>
<li>planning assessment and evaluation.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Fordlands Kindergarten is located in Rotorua and licensed to provide education and care for up to 40 children over the age of two. At the time of this ERO review there were 46 children on the roll, including 23 children from a number of iwi in the area and 3 children of Pacific Island descent.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust (CNIKT) previously known as the Central North Island Kindergarten Association (CNIKA), which provides professional support for governance, administration and personnel management.</p><p>The 2012 report identified the need to strengthen quality assurance processes, self review, assessment and planning. As a result of these concerns ERO signalled a supplementary review of the kindergarten within 12 months.</p><p>After the resignation of the head teacher at the end of 2012 careful consideration was given to the appointment of acting head teachers with particular leadership capabilities in the areas for improvement identified in the ERO report. Continuity for children and families was maintained through a planned approach to induction and transition for new staff members by the dedicated teachers who remained through this time of change.</p><p>In the middle of 2013, the new head teacher joined an experienced team and there are now four fully registered, full-time, permanent teachers in the kindergarten.</p><p>As a result of these positive improvements Central Kids Kindergartens - Fordlands is now well placed to provide positive outcomes for children and their families.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>The CNIKT have effectively managed a significant number of positive improvements, including measured and strategic changes to leadership and teaching staff, since the previous review. The CNIKT management team, and in particular the focused professional leader, provided significant and effective support and continuity for the kindergarten during a time of change.</p><p>Teachers have increased their knowledge, capability and confidence through extensive, ongoing and appropriate targeted professional learning and development, mentoring and support. These effective change-management strategies have led to a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere for families/wh&#257;nau and aiga, and significant improvements in learning opportunities for children.</p><p>The new and, experienced head teacher has worked effectively to establish a collegial and cooperative team committed to continuing to strengthen the quality of teaching and learning.</p><p>Targeted professional development in self review has resulted in significant improvements to the quality and quantity of self review undertaken by teachers. The outcome of this work has addressed the area of non-compliance in relation to self review identified in the previous ERO report. This places the kindergarten in a good position to sustain and improve the quality of education and care for children.</p><p>Teachers actively promote parent involvement in the life of the kindergarten. This is evident through increased opportunities for parents to:</p><ul>
<li>express their views and aspirations</li>
<li>participate in trips and celebrations</li>
<li>contribute to the kindergarten programme and play alongside their children</li>
<li>discuss children&rsquo;s learning with teachers.</li>
</ul><p>ERO observed significant improvements in teaching practice. There is now a good range of consistent and positive strategies that engage children in meaningful learning. The environment is well planned and presented, and enables children to access a wide variety of high-quality equipment and materials.</p><p>Progress in strengthening the assessment, planning and evaluation process is evident in:</p><ul>
<li>the development of shared expectations for teaching and learning</li>
<li>children&rsquo;s learning and development that is displayed in the kindergarten and actively shared with children and their families</li>
<li>a responsive curriculum that includes flexible routines.</li>
</ul><p>Improvements to the programme include children having opportunities to explore, problem solve, sustain their play, and pursue their interests. They are building independence, self management and social skills to support them in their play and learning.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>The CNIKT and ERO agree that there is a need for centre leaders to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>support the head teacher and teaching team to sustain the progress made</li>
<li>further develop partnerships to formally consult with the parents/ wh&#257;nau/aiga and community to build on the relationships that have been established</li>
<li>enrich the programme to reflect the language culture and identity of children</li>
<li>develop assessment, planning and evaluation processes that respond to the learning needs of older children</li>
<li>strengthen the strategic approach of the annual plan to ensure a more systematic and sustainable approach to improvement.</li>
</ul><p>ERO has confidence that the kindergarten has made sufficient progress and has appropriate support in place to sustain and improve its performance. Central Kids Kindergartens - Fordlands is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children and therefore ERO will return in 3 years.</p><a id="3-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>3 February 2014</p><a id="information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Service</h2><table>
