</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>This playcentre is located in the township of Lumsden, Northern Southland. Until recently, it was the only early childhood service in the town. Parents provide four morning sessions a week for children aged from birth to five years. A significant number of parents are working towards playcentre qualifications. There are high adult-to-child ratios during each session. Most of the parents stay with their child during the sessions to support their child's learning. </p><p>Parents at the playcentre have responded positively to the recommendations in the 2011 ERO report. These include reviewing the philosophy, incorporating bicultural practices and extending self review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Important Māori concepts are strongly evident in this centre. These include:</p><ul>
<li>ako – adults and children are seen as learners together</li>
<li>whanaungatanga – a sense of family and community</li>
<li>tuakana teina – children learning from each other.</li>
</ul><p>Children and their families benefit from the warm and caring relationships that are evident in the playcentre. Children and their parents show a real sense of belonging. Parents know every child well. ERO observed children and their parents being warmly welcomed and children enjoying friendships with each other. </p><p>Children learn and play in a calm and settled environment. They make choices about what they want to do and settle quickly. Children play for sustained periods of time and have fun together. Parents follow children’s lead and interests. They help children to grow their ideas and provide appropriate resources for them. Conversations are focused on learning. Parents involve children in the decision-making, for example consulting children about the types of resources that they need to challenge themselves in their learning. Children’s learning is enhanced by the interesting experiences in and beyond the playcentre. </p><p>Parents are very good at seeking support for children who require extra help with their learning. They work positively with children to develop social and emotional skills. </p><p>Children are well supported as they move to school. Parents ensure that the child and their family are confident and comfortable about moving onto school. The parents show a very good awareness of the individual needs of children as they approach school age. They deliberately plan programmes to ensure that their children have the knowledge and skills that they will need, for example, being familiar with the school environment and routines.</p><p>The playcentre has made major improvements to the outdoor environment. The indoor environment is stimulating for the children. Children have free access to resources to support them in their play. They also have access to a spacious and well-equipped hall for physical play on wet days. </p><p>The parents have developed comprehensive systems for recognising and recording children’s learning. They acknowledge that records could be simplified to more clearly show children’s next steps and the progress they have made. </p><p>Bicultural practices are highly evident in the playcentre. Parents have made a concerted effort since the last review in 2011 to incorporate Māori perspectives into learning programmes.</p><p>There is a useful strategic plan. Parents regularly review playcentre operations and practices. There is a strong focus on improvement. Lumsden Playcentre philosophy is evident in practice.</p><p>The Southland Playcentre Association provides strong support to the playcentre through:</p><ul>
<li>ongoing adult education</li>
<li>twice-termly visits from the playcentre liaison officer</li>
<li>advice and guidance from a Māori liaison officer</li>
<li>property and maintenance advice</li>
<li>additional funding as required</li>
<li>help to meet relicensing requirements</li>
<li>a policy and strategic planning framework</li>
<li>sound governance practices.</li>
</ul><p>The SPA provides strong leadership to guide the future direction and ongoing improvement of all its centres. This includes the way the association fosters emergent leadership. Currently there are high numbers of people participating in playcentre training. The association has identified, and ERO agrees, that its next step is to improve its knowledge and understanding of self review. It then needs to support playcentres to implement effective self review.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>There are many good processes for undertaking self review. Parents now need to ensure that reviews evaluate the effectiveness of programmes and practices. They need to also develop a schedule of self review to ensure that all aspects of the centre’s operations are reviewed over time. This includes the ongoing review of the centre philosophy, planning and assessment practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lumsden Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.</p><p>In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Lumsden Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>4 April 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
