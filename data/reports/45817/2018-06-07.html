</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Gems Childcare centre is a small centre licenced for up to 25 children over two years of age. It is located in a converted house on the edge of the Opaheke, Papakura urban area. The centre provides all day education and care for children from a wide range of cultural backgrounds, many of whom speak languages other than English at home.</p><p>The centre had a change of ownership and name in late 2016. The new manager, a qualified teacher, provides professional leadership for her new staff. She currently employs a second registered teacher, and they are supported by two other staff.</p><p>The centre philosophy is consistent with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. It focuses on respectful relationships that nurture children's wellbeing while promoting a curriculum that challenges children and promotes their exploration. Cultural diversity is valued and celebrated.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy a calm and relaxed atmosphere where they experience respectful interactions with the teachers and with each other. They have many opportunities to learn through play, developing social skills, early literacy and numeracy skills and knowledge, while their sense of wellbeing and belonging are well supported.</p><p>Teachers know the children and their families well. Parents value the friendly, welcoming approach they experience from the staff and the support given to them as parents.</p><p>Teachers work effectively with children. They spend time with them supporting their play and encouraging them to explore. Their conversations with children promote oral language development and encourage them to extend their play and to take risks in their learning.</p><p>Assessment of learning and programme planning processes are becoming more effective. Teachers observe individual children regularly and share anecdotal notes with one another. In these notes they include what learning the child might be engaged in. The learning stories that teachers write help them plan for the child. Alongside the individual planning, teachers plan for groups of children. They share these plans and information about the programme with parents in a variety of appropriate ways.</p><p>The centre's commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi is evident in the educational programme and the centre philosophy. Children have opportunities to learn te reo Māori and aspects of tikanga Māori. The cultures of all children are celebrated and parents are invited to share their knowledge of their cultures with the children and staff.</p><p>The manager is new to her role and has actively sought advice and guidance to develop effective management systems. She has successfully developed a comprehensive policy framework to guide centre operations.</p><p>Internal evaluation and strategic planning processes successfully guide ongoing improvement. Useful guidelines for internal evaluation have been developed, and reviews conducted have included consultation with parents/whānau. An annual management plan guides day-to-day management of the centre.</p><p>Good progress is being made in establishing sound personnel management systems. Professional learning and development opportunities (PLD) are linked to identified centre needs and teachers are encouraged to reflect on the implications of the PLD for their practice. Further work is required to strengthen the appraisal system.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre manager agree that the centre should continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the staff appraisal system by including teaching as inquiry as a way to promote greater reflection on teacher practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment of children's learning and programme planning by ensuring that children’s learning is revisited through subsequent learning stories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>links between internal evaluation and strategic planning so that goals are clear and guide ongoing improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers’ understanding of <em>Te Whāriki 2017</em> through ongoing professional learning and development.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Gems Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Gems Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>7 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
