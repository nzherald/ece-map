</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Glen Eden Kindergarten serves a culturally and socially diverse community in West Auckland. It offers a Kindergarten Day Model so families have the choice of children attending either six hour or 3 hour daily sessions. Teachers and the community are positive about this model.</p><p>The kindergarten is licensed to provide education and care for up to 40 children, with the majority being at least three years of age. The kindergarten team includes a head teacher, three other registered teachers, a teaching assistant, a teacher aide and an administrator.</p><p>Inclusive relationships and child-led learning are aspects of the kindergarten philosophy which is founded on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The philosophy also includes a focus on bicultural practice and environmental sustainability.</p><p>ERO’s 2012 report noted that teachers provided good quality education in a spacious and interesting environment. Children’s sense of wellbeing and belonging continues to be promoted. Since the 2012 ERO review the teaching team’s structure and roles have changed and a new head teacher has been appointed.</p><p>The kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA), which provides considered leadership, a management framework, support personnel and a programme of professional development for teachers.</p><p>After extensive review, consultation and development, the AKA has recently launched a new 10-year strategic direction. Its four strategic pillars or objectives relate to educational excellence, core organisational processes, community engagement and a future focus. These objectives are intended to guide the AKA and its kindergartens in their ongoing development. The AKA’s approach to rolling out a substantial change in its organisational structure has been carefully considered.</p><p>New AKA roles have been established to provide more targeted support for kindergarten operations, curriculum and development. Professional development is planned to support kindergarten head teachers in their leadership and management roles. A Quality Improvement Process (QIP) is being developed to monitor quality in kindergartens and contribute to self review and ongoing improvement.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten kindergartens reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers provide a culturally rich environment that is welcoming and inclusive to children and their families. A focus on children’s cultural backgrounds, and an emphasis on environmental sustainability and on healthy lifestyles are strongly evident throughout the centre.</p><p>Children have a strong sense of belonging, and know that adults respect and value their play and cultures. They are encouraged to become confident and capable learners. Children are busy and purposefully engage in self-directed play. Their developing social skills are evident in the support and concern they have for others. Children share their ideas and home language with teachers and other children.</p><p>Thoughtfully presented play areas enable children to explore and initiate play. The well-equipped, landscaped outdoor area offers children opportunities for natural science, physical challenge and imaginative play. Children’s work is prominently displayed.</p><p>Teachers are committed to developing bicultural practices and embedding te Ao Māori in the learning programme. Te reo Māori words and phrases are used. Teachers show confidence and respect in the appropriate use of tikanga Māori. Displays inform families of the importance of Māori language and values. These good practices help to affirm Māori children’s cultural identity.</p><p>The programme is based on children’s interests and the kindergarten’s goals. Teachers extend children’s understanding of the world around them in meaningful ways, nurturing children’s curiosity. Creativity and the use of technologies are encouraged. Programme planning, and implementation and assessment reflects the kindergarten’s play-based learning philosophy.</p><p>Parents expressed their appreciation of the education and care provided for children at the kindergarten. Teachers know children and their families well and invite them to share their aspirations. Parents are encouraged to be active contributors to the programme and to their child’s learning. Children’s transition to school is well supported and teachers are looking for ways to enhance this process.</p><p>Teachers are reflective, improvement focused, and collaborative. They are enthusiastic about research and professional development. Teachers acknowledge that self review could be further strengthened to be more robust and evaluative.</p><p>The AKA systems for monitoring and promoting improvement in kindergarten operations are well established. A variety of useful systems and processes contribute to the teaching team’s well established self review. Centre operations are guided by a comprehensive considered plan and a shared vision, linked to the AKA’s plan and vision. There are sound systems in place for health safety and accountability.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers and the Professional Services Manager agree that key next steps could include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening the evaluative aspects of teacher practice and self review</li>
<li>exploring ways to deepen children’s thinking and learning</li>
<li>enhancing bicultural practice. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Glen Eden Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Glen Eden Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>29 May 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <colgroup> <col> </colgroup> <colgroup> <col> </colgroup> <colgroup> <col> </colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
