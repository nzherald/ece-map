</table><p>Responding to the agreed key next steps in this report should enable Small is Beautiful Pre-School to make improvements to the quality of self review and the programmes provided for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Small is Beautiful Pre-School is a small owner-operated centre located in Devonport, Auckland. It is in the process of being relicensed under the 2008 regulations and is currently licensed for 20 children aged over two years. Most children attend for the morning session, from 9 am until noon.</p><p>The owner has managed the centre since 1982 and maintains financial and governance responsibilities. The centre has two new graduate teachers employed since the beginning of 2012, and two part time teachers. They work collaboratively as a team. Close relationships have been built with families over time.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy aims to reflect learning that 'should be generated by the richness of activities and social interactions in which the child participates'. A Christian philosophy underlies the operation of the centre. Gifted children and those with learning difficulties are identified and referred to specialist agencies. Teachers are expected to facilitate the 'teachable moment'.</p><p>The centre’s 2011 ERO report noted the centre’s balanced curriculum and warm respectful relationships with parents and whānau. Some response to the 2011 ERO recommendations and areas for development and review is evident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy positive, respectful relationships with adults and each other. Teachers support children to develop physical skills, to experiment and use their imagination. Conversations between adults and children are affirming and include good use of open questioning and modelling of language.</p><p>The centre's programme provides a variety of opportunities for children to learn through their play. Teachers provide planned science and art and craft modules. They encourage the development of children’s auditory, visual and motor skills through a range of teacher facilitated opportunities. Early literacy and numeracy skills are included in the programme. To further develop centre programmes, staff should undertake curriculum self review, supported by consideration of current early childhood education practices.</p><p>Aspects of tikanga Māori are evident in the centre programme. The centre owner has commenced a review process to improve the inclusion of te reo and tikanga Māori in centre programmes and practices. This review provides an opportunity for teachers to increase their use of te reo Māori and consider how well they support Māori children, as Māori.</p><p>Teachers keep detailed records of children’s progress and parents can access this information. In 2008 and 2011, ERO recommended that teachers update their programme planning, assessment and evaluation practices. While some changes are evident, these aspects remain as areas for further development.</p><p>It is positive to note that the centre owner meets with teachers regularly to discuss the programme. Professional development would help teachers to evaluate programmes in more depth and to focus on what they are learning about children and their own teaching practice. This more targeted evaluation would provide useful information to support continual improvement in professional practice.</p><p>Further development of self-review strategies for accountability and improvement should support the centre team’s decision making and help identify priorities for development. This self review should also support the centre owner in developing the centre’s strategic vision and annual management plans.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre owner agree that that key next steps for centre review and development are:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to develop staff knowledge and use of assessment, planning and self review</li>
<li>further documenting the ways in which children’s interests and parents aspirations are used to plan programmes</li>
<li>increasing the inclusion of New Zealand’s bicultural heritage in centre programmes and the environment</li>
<li>evaluating centre programmes and teaching and learning practices in more depth</li>
<li>reviewing all policies and practices to ensure they align with the 2008 Early Childhood Regulations</li>
<li>developing a strategic plan to provide direction for centre development.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the centre owner accesses external advice to assist in the review and development of the areas agreed as key next steps</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Small is Beautiful Pre-School completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To meet requirements the centre owner agrees to:</p><ul>
<li>document an annual plan to guide the service’s operation. <em>[</em><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 1998, GMA8.]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Small is Beautiful Pre-School will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>6 March 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
