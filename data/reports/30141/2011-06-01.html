<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p>PORSE (Play, Observe, Record, Support, Extend, Evaluate) is an in-home early childhood organisation with it National Service Office located in Hawkes Bay. Area offices are located throughout New Zealand. Within the area offices, PORSE personnel, including coaches and programme tutors, work with parents, nanny educators and home educators to provide early childhood education and care for infants, toddlers and young children. Children are cared for in their own homes or in small groups in the home of their educator.</p>
<p>The PORSE mission is &ldquo;to have all people in New Zealand schooled in nurturing and educating children in their care.&rdquo; Families are valued partners in children&rsquo;s education and care.</p>
<p>The PORSE Meadowbank Q1 network provides for 102 children in the Eastern Bays area of Auckland. Programme tutors, who are registered teachers, have primary responsibility for children&rsquo;s learning. They provide support, encouragement and informative resources for in-home educators. PORSE offers many opportunities for educators to support each other and to participate in professional development.</p>
<p>Educators foster children&rsquo;s social and emotional development, and children benefit from warm, caring interactions in familiar environments. Educators use community facilities and PORSE playschools to provide children with regular opportunities to play and interact with other children. PORSE encourages educators to make the most of natural environments. Re-focusing assessment, planning and reflective practice on children&rsquo;s learning would help programme tutors to enrich outcomes for children in both home and playschool environments.</p>
<p>Parents/wh&#257;nau select their children&rsquo;s educators. They have direct day-to-day relationships with educators and are well informed about their children&rsquo;s daily activities. Parents/wh&#257;nau are generally happy with the services offered by PORSE, although they would like more involvement in programme and planning for their children. ERO suggests that PORSE review how the organisation supports staff to develop their confidence and skills in fostering bi-cultural practices and improving partnerships with M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau.</p>
<p>The PORSE coach and programme tutors agree that a next step is for them to further develop self review and strengthen planning, assessment and evaluation practices so that they provide better support for children&rsquo;s learning. It could also be beneficial for PORSE to review its support for programme tutors to help them refocus their work on outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO will review the service again within three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of PORSE Meadowbank Q1 was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by PORSE Meadowbank Q1 to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the service (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atPORSE Meadowbank Q1.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>This review of PORSE Meadowbank Q1 is informed by organisational and local documentation, visits to homes selected by PORSE, interviews with PORSE staff and educators, written feedback from parents, and observations of programmes provided for children.</p>
<p>In PORSE Meadowbank Area Office a team approach means all staff have direct contact with families and educators to support enrolment, induction and office administration.</p>
<h4>Areas of good performance</h4>
<p>Relationships. Affirming, respectful relationships between programme tutors, families, educators and children are a strength of the service. Practices that support positive relationships include:</p>
<ul><li>home-based education and care settings, which promote the formation of strong attachments between children and educators;</li>
<li>responsive and respectful interactions between educators and children;</li>
<li>educators becoming a part of the child&rsquo;s extended family;</li>
<li>increasing levels of communication by PORSE personnel with families and educators; and</li>
<li>social events for staff, educators and families to recognise and celebrate success and progress.</li>
</ul><p>Children benefit from these positive relationships.</p>
<p>Learning environments. Children learn in appropriate, well resourced home-based learning environments. Good use is made of community resources, events and weekly PORSE playschool sessions to provide children with opportunities for active participation, exploration and social contact with their peers.</p>
<p>Programme implementation. Educators develop programmes in response to children&rsquo;s identified needs and interests. Home-based experiences are complemented by a range of group sessions in community settings. Features of the programmes provided for children include educators:</p>
<ul><li>promoting children&rsquo;s social skills and fostering their sense of security and belonging;</li>
<li>encouraging children to be independent and self managing;</li>
<li>listening and responding to children&rsquo;s conversations and ideas;</li>
<li>ensuring that the home-based programme is well supported by appropriate resources;</li>
<li>providing regular opportunities for children to play and interact with other children at playschools, nature playschools and excursions; and</li>
<li>recording children&rsquo;s involvement in learning through photographic displays and journal entries.</li>
</ul><p>Reflective practice. Programme tutors reflect on and critique their professional practice. They evaluate the programme provided at playschools and music groups, and identify areas for improvement. Programme tutors have identified that their next step is to model and share these good practices with educators to further develop their understanding of assessment and evaluation of children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p>In-depth self review. Information about self review is gathered in multiple ways. It would be beneficial for the coach and programme tutors to continue to strengthen their evaluation of this information to ensure that educators are supported to extend children&rsquo;s learning. PORSE could:</p>
<p>review the quality of appraisals for programme tutors and educators to ensure there is an increased focus on teaching and learning and on the provision of constructive feedback to increase educators&rsquo; knowledge and skills; and</p>
<p>support programme tutors to focus on children&rsquo;s learning and progress by providing better quality comments in their visit notes.</p>
<p>In order to sustain a high functioning team, it would be useful for PORSE to consider providing ongoing external professional learning opportunities for programme tutors. This training should enable them to share examples of, and model, good practice with educators.</p>
<a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3>
<p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul><li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service;</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children;</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3>
<p>The PORSE M&#257;ori as Tangata Whenua policy promotes connections with M&#257;ori communities and professional development for staff on the application of the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. It aims to increase M&#257;ori participation and to ensure that training programmes reflect the bicultural nature of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Programme tutors at the PORSE Meadowbank office currently have responsibility for three children of M&#257;ori descent.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p>Relationships with families. There is a strong emphasis on building positive, respectful and supportive relationships with educators, children and their wh&#257;nau. Daily interaction assists educators to be responsive to the needs and aspirations of wh&#257;nau, and to discuss shared strategies for working with children. Daily journal entries keep wh&#257;nau informed about their children&rsquo;s activities.</p>
<h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p>Documentation. Educators&rsquo; discussions with wh&#257;nau could be more frequently included in family manuals, programme tutor records and children&rsquo;s journals. Maintaining records of how educators and programme tutors value and respond to children&rsquo;s cultural heritage and the input of wh&#257;nau is likely to contribute to the development of more effective partnerships that support children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p>Review of policy and practice. It would be worthwhile for PORSE Meadowbank Q1 to review the application of the PORSE M&#257;ori as Tangata Whenua policy and consider how they could:</p>
<ul><li>increasethe knowledge and skills of all staff so that they can ensure that aspects of bicultural practice are reflected in the organisation;</li>
<li>ensure that the bicultural nature of Aotearoa/New Zealand is reflected to a greater extent in home and playschool programmes for children;</li>
<li>consider goals and strategies to improve educational outcomes for M&#257;ori children as M&#257;ori; and</li>
<li>implement appraisal practices that reflect the service&rsquo;s expectations for bicultural practice.</li>
</ul><a id="4-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management and staff of PORSE Meadowbank Q1 completed an ERO Home-Based CareManagement Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>

<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practices, PORSE should ensure that:</p>
<ul><li>all practicable steps are taken to eliminate, isolate, or minimise hazards to help ensure the safety of children;</li>
<li>poisonous or harmful plants are removed from PORSE environments and that hygienic hand-washing facilities are provided for children; and</li>
<li>educators attain their First Aid Certificates within the required timeframe.</li>
</ul><a id="5-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Recommendation</h2>

<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-porse-meadowbank-q1" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of PORSE Meadowbank Q1</h2>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report onPORSE (Play, Observe, Record, Support, Extend, Evaluate) is an in-home early childhood organisation with it National Service Office located in Hawkes Bay. Area offices are located throughout New Zealand. Within the area offices, PORSE personnel, including coaches and programme tutors, work with parents, nanny educators and home educators to provide early childhood education and care for infants, toddlers and young children. Children are cared for in their own homes or in small groups in the home of their educator.</p>
<p>The PORSE mission is &ldquo;to have all people in New Zealand schooled in nurturing and educating children in their care.&rdquo; Families are valued partners in children&rsquo;s education and care.</p>
<p>The PORSE Meadowbank Q1 network provides for 102 children in the Eastern Bays area of Auckland. Programme tutors, who are registered teachers, have primary responsibility for children&rsquo;s learning. They provide support, encouragement and informative resources for in-home educators. PORSE offers many opportunities for educators to support each other and to participate in professional development.</p>
<p>Educators foster children&rsquo;s social and emotional development, and children benefit from warm, caring interactions in familiar environments. Educators use community facilities and PORSE playschools to provide children with regular opportunities to play and interact with other children. PORSE encourages educators to make the most of natural environments. Re-focusing assessment, planning and reflective practice on children&rsquo;s learning would help programme tutors to enrich outcomes for children in both home and playschool environments.</p>
<p>Parents/wh&#257;nau select their children&rsquo;s educators. They have direct day-to-day relationships with educators and are well informed about their children&rsquo;s daily activities. Parents/wh&#257;nau are generally happy with the services offered by PORSE, although they would like more involvement in programme and planning for their children. ERO suggests that PORSE review how the organisation supports staff to develop their confidence and skills in fostering bi-cultural practices and improving partnerships with M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau.</p>
<p>The PORSE coach and programme tutors agree that a next step is for them to further develop self review and strengthen planning, assessment and evaluation practices so that they provide better support for children&rsquo;s learning. It could also be beneficial for PORSE to review its support for programme tutors to help them refocus their work on outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO will review the service again within three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood service we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
