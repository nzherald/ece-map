</table><p>The Enchanted Garden Early Childhood Centre 2007 Limited is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Enchanted Garden Early Childhood Centre 2007 Limited is a small, privately-owned, home-like service. The centre provides education and care for infants, toddlers and children to school age in two separate areas. An increasing number of children are from a diverse range of cultures.</p><p>Children and parents experience a welcoming and inclusive environment. The philosophy statements place importance on integrating bicultural practice and concepts into the learning programmes. There is a strong focus on fostering children's wellbeing and learning.</p><p>Most teachers are qualified early childhood teachers. A number of them have worked at the centre for long periods of time. The owner takes responsibility for the operation, management and leadership of the centre.</p><p>The centre has made good progress since the 2013 ERO review by strengthening assessment practices, the appraisal system and long term planning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience positive, respectful relationships with their teachers and each other. They have many opportunities to explore ideas and make their own discoveries. Children choose from a wide range of interesting activities to foster their creative and imaginative play, oral language, literacy and mathematics learning.</p><p>Teachers are highly responsive to children's interests, strengths and abilities. They work well together to assess children’s learning and prepare the environment.</p><p>Teachers are deeply focused on providing a bicultural learning programme. They integrate Māori concepts and values into children’s learning and assessment. Children have an appropriate range of respectful opportunities to learn about their home language and culture.</p><p>Children enjoy a range of health and physical activities in their learning programme. Teachers encourage children to care for themselves, others and the environment. The outside area is well resourced with a good range of equipment to challenge children's learning and development. Children help tend the edible garden and prepare healthy food.</p><p>Infants and toddlers experience unhurried, respectful interactions with adults. They are effectively supported to develop and extend their oral language skills. Children have many opportunities to freely explore the environment and access resources. Teachers follow well-paced, individual home routines that foster children's sense of security and wellbeing.</p><p>Transitions into, within and beyond the centre are well managed, flexible and focused on child and family needs. Leaders have a positive relationship with the local school and are continuing to build purposeful links with other schools.</p><p>Parents are well informed about children’s participation, interests and learning. They have a range of opportunities to contribute to children's learning and the operation of the centre.</p><p>The centre manager provides supportive leadership, guidance and clear expectations. Teachers are encouraged to be reflective and build their knowledge and skills. Leaders and teachers have a shared, systematic approach to self review and are focused on ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that the next steps for ongoing improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing planning and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the use of parent aspirations and partnerships in learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refining long-term planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the staff appraisal system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a more strategic approach to self review and evaluation. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Enchanted Garden Early Childhood Centre 2007 Limited will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>11 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
