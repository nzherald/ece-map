</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kiddy Winks Kindergarten provides sessional or all-day care for up to 30 children over two years of age. The centre is governed by the Kiddy Winks Trust, serves an ethnically diverse community, and is closely linked to the Manurewa Baptist Church. It integrates Christian principles and family values into the daily programme.</p><p>The Trust has overseen the centre for over 25 years and continues to provide a relevant policy and management framework. Daily centre operations are delegated to the centre manager who distributes leadership roles. The current centre manager was appointed soon after the 2014 ERO report.</p><p>Almost all teachers are certificated. They are supported by regular professional learning related to their individual development goals and the direction of the centre. Teachers reflect the cultural and language diversity of the centre families.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is underpinned by the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers work in partnership with whānau to offer a learning programme that supports each child's unique interests. Providing for all children's interests and capabilities is a priority of the team.</p><p>ERO's 2014 report noted many positive practices that have been sustained. It also identified key next steps for the centre, including self review and strategic planning. These areas and next steps for curriculum development continue to be areas of focus.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Inclusive and affirming relationships help tamariki at Kiddy Winks to gain the confidence to play and learn alongside each other and to develop independence. Teachers demonstrate a real interest in children, and are increasingly responsive to their ideas as they join in children’s learning. Children are friendly and settled, and busily engage in the learning opportunities that teachers offer.</p><p>Children are valued and respected as learners. Their play is recognised as a vehicle for learning. Children learn at their own pace in a well-resourced, calm and supportive environment. They have meaningful conversations with each other and with adults, and have opportunities to engage in complex and sustained play.</p><p>The centre’s programme enacts its philosophy well, and includes strategies aimed at supporting children to be successful in all their endeavours. It is very responsive to the children's cultural heritages. Tikanga Māori is strongly evident in routines and practices that clearly reflect the bicultural underpinnings of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Programmes also feature learning experiences that acknowledge and celebrate children’s Pacific heritages and languages. They support Māori children to succeed as Māori, and all children to stand tall in their own cultures.</p><p>Teachers are increasing their responsiveness to children's interests in their planning and assessment practices. Plans reflect children's common interests, have a good emphasis on family and community and are complemented by planning for individual children. Parents can contribute to these plans by sharing their perspectives of their children's interests and developmental needs. Literacy and numeracy are integral aspects of the curriculum. Teachers are well placed to continue to implement intentional teaching strategies, focused on positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The performance management system ensures that teachers are appraised against Education Council requirements. The manager has adapted the process so it is personalised for each teacher, aligns with the centre’s strategic direction and is improving individual and collective professional practice. A next step could be to focus appraisal processes more directly on outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre is well led. The manager has received high quality external professional learning and guidance. She has established many sound systems for centre operations and for the programme provided by teachers. The manager and teachers are in the process of creating better links with local primary schools and Communities of Learning to ensure smoother transitions and pathways for children's learning.</p><p>The manager reports to the Trust against strategic goals and teaching programmes. Since there are new trust members, the Trust could further support the manager by evaluating its governance role.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps for development should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>aligning strategic and annual planning with a stronger focus on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening internal evaluation to guide improvements that foster positive learning outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiddy Winks Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the early childhood service management should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>update the personnel policy to ensure that the staff selection process aligns with current legal requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase the rigour of risk analysis and management process for excursions.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kiddy Winks Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>7 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
