</table><p>Plum Tree Preschool Millwater is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Plum Tree Preschool Millwater provides education and care for up to 30 children, including 10 children aged under two years. The centre operates in a renovated, modern home in a quiet residential area of Millwater on Auckland's North Shore. Children are based in the Kiwi, Fantail or Tui rooms. All ages combine for outside play in a newly renovated space.</p><p>The service's philosophy promotes sustainable practices and respect for the environment. Regular walks in the local bush feature in the programme. The neighbouring park is also used to extend opportunities for children's physical activity. Teachers have established relationships with local schools to support transitions for older children.</p><p>This service has been fully licensed since 2013 and was last reviewed by ERO in 2015. The current owner purchased the centre in October 2016, and has established a new teaching team with a fresh philosophy, vision, policies and practices. Most staff are qualified. They work collaboratively to support positive outcomes for children's learning and wellbeing, and have a strong bicultural commitment. This is the first ERO evaluation of the centre under its new ownership.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>In Tui Room, children aged over three years confidently explore their environment. They participate with enthusiasm and engagement in free play as well as in more structured mat times. They demonstrate good relationships with their peers and teachers, negotiating their ideas and needs for play and exploration. Children engage in their chosen pursuits for sustained periods of time, with a particular focus on imaginative play and exploring nature. Teachers provide well-considered resources, and pose questions that support children's individual interests and group projects.</p><p>Infants and toddlers in the Kiwi and Fantail rooms are well supported in their care routines. They enjoy exploring these peaceful, inviting and uncluttered spaces. Teachers know children well and connect centre and home experiences, fostering each child's developing sense of belonging and wellbeing. Teachers work respectfully and flexibly, following children's emerging interests and supporting their individual stages of development.</p><p>Parents are valued by the teaching team. Their opinions and aspirations help teachers to shape the environment and programme, and to be responsive to children's needs and interests. Newsletters and wall displays share information with parents about significant aspects of the centre's philosophy and programme. This promotes positive outcomes for children's learning and wellbeing, including social competence. Policy review is consultative and the team is quick to respond to parents' suggestions.</p><p>Children enjoy reflecting on their prior experiences through portfolios. Teachers identify their individual and group interests, strengths and challenges in these learning stories. They purposefully record ideas for how they might enrich and extend children's play and exploration. Children's voices are evident in the learning stories, and parents are also invited to contribute, creating connections with family life. The centre plans to introduce a digital platform for sharing learning stories in 2019 that should enhance communication about children's learning and development.</p><p>The owner has worked with commitment to establish a new team and relevant documents that guide systems, processes and routines. This has fostered the smooth running of the service during a time of transition. Regular team meetings support teachers to collaborate and to share information in a timely way. Appraisal has been initiated with a focus on inquiry into the effectiveness of teachers' practice. Change has been guided by self review and research into best practice in early childhood education.</p><p>The service's strategic goals are clearly articulated and align with the philosophy and vision. It is now timely to strengthen annual planning and actions to focus more deliberately on meeting these goals. This focus should also be prioritised in teachers' inquiry, team meetings, professional development and evaluation. A streamlined approach would support the team to work more cohesively to achieve future goals within relevant timeframes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>aligning strategic goals with annual action plans, professional development, inquiry and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>formalising systems for teachers' appraisal.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Plum Tree Preschool Millwater completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice the owner plans to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review routines in Kiwi and Fantail to maintain supervision ratios as children move around the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make changes to the outdoor environment to reduce the drop height from the deck to the garden</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the process for the identification and management of hazards and risk when planning excursions out of the centre.</p>
</li>

ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed</li>
<li>Well placed</li>
<li>Requires further development</li>
<li>Not well placed</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
