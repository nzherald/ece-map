</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Oakura Playcentre is a community-based service located in coastal Taranaki. The playcentre is situated adjacent to the local school and is licensed for four mornings per week.</p><p>Up to 30 children from birth to school age can attend each session. The current roll is 50 children. There has been a significant influx of new families in the last 12 months.</p><p>The centre philosophy reflects the value placed on children and families learning alongside each other in a stimulating, family environment.</p><p>The playcentre is one of 17 parent-led services governed under the Taranaki Playcentre Association (the association) umbrella. The governance of these centres has recently reverted to a structure where all centre representatives contribute to association decisions and priorities.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 14 playcentre reviews in the Taranaki Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and families show a positive sense of belonging. Older children interact with younger children in caring and nurturing ways. Some adults make good use of conversations to build on individual interests. A next step is maximising these opportunities to actively support and build on children’s learning and thinking.</p><p>There is a wide range of resources available, many of which reflect the context of the community and invite children’s exploration. Links with the local school include reciprocal visits and participating in school-based activities. Outings in the community add to children’s experiences.</p><p>A feature of the programme is regular opportunities for children and families to learn about and care for the natural environment. An emphasis on sustainable practices is evident in resourcing and curriculum activities.</p><p>Playcentre leaders have an appropriate and timely focus on encouraging other parents to undertake course training, to enable them to more consistently meet the supervision requirements. This includes ensuring there is a shared understanding of the expectations associated with a parent cooperative.</p><p>An enthusiastic office holder leads developments in the bicultural programme. This progress has been supported by the Puriri W’akamaru o Taranaki role that was established by the association to build bicultural understandings. Acknowledged next steps are to develop strategies and approaches to effectively promote Māori children and whānau to enjoy success as Māori.</p><p>Both Oakura Playcentre and the association have annual plans that inform operational decisions. However, there are few links between the association and individual playcentre goals. The association’s strategic vision is yet to effectively focus on priorities for improving teaching and learning.</p><p>The association has planned professional development for parents in 2014 about planning and evaluation. ERO agrees that this is timely, as the playcentre is yet to effectively implement useful approaches for assessing and planning children’s learning.</p><p>A recent focus for the centre has been to establish a process to formally document self reviews. Informal review processes occur to address aspects of the programme and health and safety areas. As well as the playcentre, the association is at very early stages in its understanding of, and response to developing self-review processes and practices that focus on teaching and learning.</p><p>ERO recommends the association strengthen its understanding of self review through external support in order to better support the playcentre. This includes developing more robust ways of knowing the impact of its services on children’s learning and development, and the quality of the educational programmes.</p><p>Association personnel regularly visit and provide advice and guidance. Positive relationships between the playcentre and those in support roles are evident. The association also offers opportunities for parents to train in playcentre early childhood education courses. Extending and improving the support the association offers to playcentres is an important next step.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to improve practice the playcentre needs to:</p><ul>
<li>identify more clearly the learning that is occurring and children’s next learning steps in their assessment records, including how this information is used to plan for individual children and the impact of the planned programme on children’s learning</li>
<li>describe more clearly the practices adults will use to extend children’s learning, in particular best practice interactions that build on and extend children’s thinking</li>
<li>improve self review to more clearly show the impact of adults' practices and learning on outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>The association would benefit from external support to strengthen and improve its understanding of:</p><ul>
<li>annual and strategic planning that better informs priorities for teaching and learning</li>
<li>relevant approaches to assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>fostering opportunities for Māori children and whānau to have success as Māori</li>
<li>supporting members understanding of teaching and learning; and regulatory requirements</li>
<li>current self-review approaches.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Oakura Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice the playcentre needs to ensure:</p><ul>
<li>the front gate is designed so that children are not able to leave the premises without the knowledge of adults providing education and care<em>[Education</em> <em>(Early Childhood Services) 2008, Regulation 45(1)(a)(i&amp;ii)</em></li>
<li>all heavy furniture, fixtures, and equipment that could fall or topple and cause serious injury or damage are secured.<em>[Education</em> <em>(Early Childhood Services) 2008, Regulation 46 (1) (a)</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Oakura Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>24 January 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
