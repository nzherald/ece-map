<html><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Collingwood Playcentre is one of 14 parent-led centres that operate under the umbrella of the Nelson Playcentres Association (the association). Strategic and policy direction for centre operations is provided by association personnel. They also work in collaboration with centre members to develop and maintain the quality of the early childhood facilities, taking responsibility for education, property and equipment and providing training. A liaison officer appointed by the association provides professional advice, guidance and support for the centre. The association office administrator undertakes the role of service provider contact.</p><p align="left">The strong playcentre philosophy is clearly evident in practice. Children benefit from their participation in the rich core curriculum and playing in mixed-age groupings. Adults are very responsive to children&rsquo;s self-initiated interests and learning. The high numbers of adults at sessions enables their sustained engagement with individual children and small groups.</p><p align="left">Children learn and play in a considerably enhanced environment as a result of substantial redevelopment of the playcentre facilities. It is inviting, spacious and richly resourced. Materials and equipment are well organised and easily accessible to children. There is good provision for babies and their parents.</p><p align="left">Children are settled and demonstrate a sense of belonging in this familiar environment. Infants are contented, secure and respond with delight as adults and other children engage with them. Older children confidently share their ideas and experiences, nurture the younger ones and are developing good social skills.</p><p align="left">A strong sense of community is evident. A high number of members take an active role in running the playcentre and being involved in their children&rsquo;s education. The playcentre is an important focal point in the local district. Positive and supportive relationships are well established with the adjacent school and other community groups.</p><p align="left">Centre members agree that areas for continued development include aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation and further integration of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori. In-depth, evidence-based self review as a tool for improvement is not well understood.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Collingwood Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atCollingwood Playcentre.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Collingwood Playcentre operates under the umbrella of the association. Association personnel provide guidance and support to centre members for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning practices. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>the objectives outlined in the strategic plan which set the expectations for quality learning experiences, clear communication with members and streamlining of operation and administration systems</li>
<li>a set of robust policies guiding centre practice that are regularly reviewed and updated</li>
<li>an extensive range of workshops and professional development offered in response to team goals and training modules</li>
<li>liaison officers who play a key role in the association by providing advice and guidance to centres</li>
<li>support for identified children with moderate to severe special needs through the provision of a special needs resource person and access to funding</li>
<li>Te Roopu Wh&#257;nau o Whakatu, a group of association families, to support individual centres with a range of initiatives to further the learning and development of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau at playcentre.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Centre members, with the support of the association, have worked to address the areas for improvement identified in the August 2007 ERO report.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Programme The strong playcentre philosophy soundly underpins the programme and is clearly evident in practice. Children benefit from their participation in the rich core curriculum and playing in mixed-age groupings. The high numbers of adults at sessions enables their sustained engagement with individual children and small groups. Adults are very responsive to children&rsquo;s self-initiated interests and learning.</p><p align="left">A daily evaluation form assists team discussions and records how adults respond to and extend children&rsquo;s learning and interests. Evaluations are prominently displayed with the related learning stories and used to provide continuity across sessions. These documents show that te reo M&#257;ori is well used by some members and how children are becoming familiar with the language.</p><p align="left">Assessment Children&rsquo;s individual profile folders provide a good record of their participation in the programme and their developing relationships. There are some good models that record the continuity of children&rsquo;s learning over time. Effective strategies support centre members to contribute significant moments they have noticed about children&rsquo;s play and thinking.</p><p align="left">Environment Children learn and play in a considerably enhanced environment as a result of substantial redevelopment of the playcentre facilities. It is inviting, spacious and richly resourced. Materials and equipment are well organised and easily accessible to children. There is good provision for babies and their parents. The many natural elements both inside and outdoors allow children to experience and investigate nature. Children use the whole of the environment to explore, play and follow their interests.</p><p align="left">Interactions Children are settled and demonstrate a sense of belonging in this familiar environment. Infants are contented, secure and respond with delight as adults and other children engage with them. Older children confidently share their ideas and experiences, nurture the younger ones and are developing good social skills.</p><p align="left">Centre members are calm, positive and affirming and support each other well as they interact with children. They provide relevant and realistic explanations and use good questions as they work alongside and converse with children.</p><p align="left">Self review Annual and strategic planning are soundly based on parent feedback and aspirations for their children&rsquo;s early education. These plans are discussed regularly during the year and briefly evaluated to note progress.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Planning and evaluation Daily evaluations require a stronger focus on identifying strategies to support or extend children&rsquo;s learning. Focusing on the effectiveness of these strategies rather than the provision of further activities is likely to enable centre members to support and extend children&rsquo;s learning to a higher level.</p><p align="left">Assessment While some good models are evident, the quality of assessment for learning in children&rsquo;s profile folders is variable. These records are yet to celebrate children&rsquo;s home cultures.</p><p align="left">Bicultural practice Although some members use te reo M&#257;ori regularly, te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori requires further integration across the programme.</p><p align="left">Self review Centre members identify that both spontaneous and in-depth, evidence-based self review as a tool for improvement is not well understood and requires development. ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation confirms this.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Collingwood Playcentre completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><p>&nbsp;</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-collingwood-playcentre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Collingwood Playcentre</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Collingwood Playcentre.</p><p align="left">Collingwood Playcentre is one of 14 parent-led centres that operate under the umbrella of the Nelson Playcentres Association (the association). Strategic and policy direction for centre operations is provided by association personnel. They also work in collaboration with centre members to develop and maintain the quality of the early childhood facilities, taking responsibility for education, property and equipment and providing training. A liaison officer appointed by the association provides professional advice, guidance and support for the centre. The association office administrator undertakes the role of service provider contact.</p><p align="left">The strong playcentre philosophy is clearly evident in practice. Children benefit from their participation in the rich core curriculum and playing in mixed-age groupings. Adults are very responsive to children&rsquo;s self-initiated interests and learning. The high numbers of adults at sessions enables their sustained engagement with individual children and small groups.</p><p align="left">Children learn and play in a considerably enhanced environment as a result of substantial redevelopment of the playcentre facilities. It is inviting, spacious and richly resourced. Materials and equipment are well organised and easily accessible to children. There is good provision for babies and their parents.</p><p align="left">Children are settled and demonstrate a sense of belonging in this familiar environment. Infants are contented, secure and respond with delight as adults and other children engage with them. Older children confidently share their ideas and experiences, nurture the younger ones and are developing good social skills.</p><p align="left">A strong sense of community is evident. A high number of members take an active role in running the playcentre and being involved in their children&rsquo;s education. The playcentre is an important focal point in the local district. Positive and supportive relationships are well established with the adjacent school and other community groups.</p><p align="left">Centre members agree that areas for continued development include aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation and further integration of te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori. In-depth, evidence-based self review as a tool for improvement is not well understood.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Joyce Gebbie</p><p align="left">Acting National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Central Region</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p align="left"><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
