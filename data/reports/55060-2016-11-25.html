</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Taradale Playcentre is located in the Napier suburb of Taradale. The centre is open for three morning sessions a week. It is licensed for 25 children, including 15 children up to two years. Parents stay with their children.</p><p>The centre is managed as a parent cooperative with support from experienced personnel from the Hawkes Bay Playcentre Association (the association).</p><p>Members help each other and learn together. All parents have, or are working towards a Playcentre qualification.</p><p>The association has addressed the areas for development identified in the February 2014 ERO report. It has defined the roles and responsibilities of the executive committee to provide better support for individual playcentres. Procedures for the employment of paid staff have been developed and implemented. These include police vetting and appraisal.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven in the Hawkes Bay Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Playcentre's philosophy of children and their whānau learning together through play is highly evident.</p><p>Children and their parents know each other well. Responsive, caring and respectful relationships foster children's sense of belonging.</p><p>The well-resourced environment is responsive to children's interests and strengths, and enables them to initiate their own play. They are able to make choices and are supported by adults to take risks and solve problems. Literacy, mathematics and science are well integrated into the programme. Children have fun as part of the learning process. They are affirmed for their efforts and success is celebrated.</p><p>Routines are responsive to the needs of different age groups. Younger children have access to a good range of resources to cater for their ages and stages of development. There is a strong focus on fostering independence and self-help skills.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs and their parents are well supported to participate and engage in learning at the playcentre.</p><p>The curriculum is linked to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, the playcentre philosophy and children's preference for learning. Recent developments of assessment and planning practices has increased members focus on children's learning. They notice, recognise and respond to children's emerging interests and plan activities and resources accordingly. This model is visible and assists members' understanding of the assessment and planning cycle and documentation of children's learning. Members are continuing to refine this process and have identified the need to focus on how they are evaluating the effectiveness of the programme on outcomes for children.</p><p>Profile books are personalised and capture and celebrate children's learning, development and engagement in centre activities.</p><p>A commitment to implementing bicultural practices is evident. Members are growing in confidence in their use of te reo Māori. Puriri Whakamaru o Heretaunga is an association initiative which provides support to Māori whānau attending playcentre, and guidance to individual centres to strengthen their understanding of te ao Māori.</p><p>Emergent leadership is fostered. New members are encouraged to gain a Playcentre qualification. A collaborative approach values and affirms each person's knowledge and skills.</p><p>A framework for the appraisal of paid team members has been developed. The association continues to support the playcentre with its implementation.</p><p>Members are focused on improving outcomes for children and adults attending the centre. An established process for self review informs change and improvement. The focus should now shift from investigating what the centre is doing to evaluating how well they are doing it. This should enable them to know what is working well for children and their families.</p><p>The association has put in place sound systems and processes to provide ongoing centre support until the national restructure of Playcentre has been completed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Members and ERO have agreed that there is a need for parents, with the support of the association to continue to develop their knowledge and understanding of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Taradale Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Taradale Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>25 November 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
