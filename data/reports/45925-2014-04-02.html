</table><p>Little Kingdom Christian Preschool requires external support to improve the quality of the curriculum provided for children and the effectiveness of teaching practices.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Kingdom Christian Preschool, in Mangere, is a new early childhood centre that opened in 2012. The centre is licensed for up to 30 children over two years of age. The majority of children on the centre roll are of Māori and Pacific heritage.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy highlights the provision of a learning programme based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, Montessori practices, and Christian values. The centre owners are keen to further develop the effective practices they have introduced in the time the centre has been open. The positive impact of the ongoing focus on promoting healthy eating is evident in the good lunch options brought to the centre by children.</p><p>The centre manager and head teacher lead a team that includes three qualified teachers. Teachers are now engaging in professional development to help them develop a high quality curriculum programme and effective teaching practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are curious and keen to learn. They enjoy positive relationships with each other. Children have access to a range of resources and good access to the outdoor learning environment. They are involved in simple play activities and are respectful, compliant learners. As part of the programme, children have set routines and learning activities for three age groups. Children are familiar with Montessori activities and teachers use these times well to promote mathematical concepts.</p><p>Teachers are beginning to include te reo Māori in routines and should continue to model the use of te reo throughout the day. The recognition and inclusion of children’s cultures in the programme and learning environment would also be worthwhile to support children’s sense of identity and self worth.</p><p>Teachers keep attractive portfolios of children’s progress. These records show children's involvement in the programme and are accessible to parents and children. Teachers identify children requiring additional learning support and access external assistance for them.</p><p>Teachers work closely alongside children. Their interactions are mostly directive and as such, do not support children well to make decisions and choices. It would be useful for children to have more opportunities to initiate their own play. Teachers have begun to access professional support to help them evaluate programmes, be more observant of children’s learning, and consider their own teaching responses.</p><p>Two parent surveys done by the centre show parents appreciation of the focus on developing children's oral language. Parents also note the value they place on the centre's Christian philosophy and the positive environment provided for children.</p><p>The centre has made positive beginnings in establishing a process for self review. Managers acknowledge their newness as a centre and the importance of ongoing learning and development for all staff. They have developed a strategic vision and an annual management plan. It would be beneficial for long-term planning to focus on changes that improve learning outcomes for children. Self review, that includes staff and families, should then be used to monitor progress towards these goals and identify next development steps.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teaching practice continues to develop. Teachers could now enhance the programme by focusing on extending children’s learning within the context of play. To help children to be more actively engaged as learners, teachers should increase the level of challenge and choice in the programme. They could promote children’s thinking and creativity by:</p><ul>
<li>valuing children’s potential as confident, capable learners and developing children's self-management skills</li>
<li>focusing on learning outcomes for children, rather than on activities, in their planning, assessment and evaluation</li>
<li>fostering children’s development of literacy and numeracy skills in the context of play</li>
<li>continuing their focus on developing children’s oral language and social skills</li>
<li>supporting children’s transition to school through good practices aligned to the principles and strands of <em>Te Whāriki</em>.</li>
</ul><p>Centre managers should strengthen practices by ensuring:</p><ul>
<li>the centre’s strategic plan focuses on outcomes for children and includes references to <em>Ka Hikitia</em>, the Ministry of Education’s Māori Education strategy</li>
<li>the head teacher’s appraiser is a fully registered teacher who has experience of the early childhood curriculum.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Kingdom Christian Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>To meet agreed accountabilities the centre director and manager must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>educators engage in meaningful, positive interactions to enhance children’s learning and nurture reciprocal relationships</li>
<li>educators demonstrate an understanding of children’s learning and development that is consistent with current research, theory, and practices in early childhood education</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008,</em> (GM43 6 C3-4)]</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Kingdom Christian Preschool will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>2 April 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
