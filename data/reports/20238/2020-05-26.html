</table><p>Palms Preschool is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Palms Preschool is privately owned and located on Auckland’s North Shore. It is licensed to provide education and care for 34 children, including five aged under two years. At the time of this review, 22 children attended the centre.</p><p>The licensee/managing director, a qualified early childhood teacher, is responsible for the day-to-day running of the service. Most of the staff are qualified and long-serving. The centre employs an administrative assistant and cook.</p><p>The philosophy is focused on providing a play-based programme in an environment that stimulates wonder, curiosity and a love of learning.</p><p>The November 2016 ERO report identified next steps for development that prioritised increasing the depth and evaluative nature of long-term self review, strengthening strategic planning, further developing the appraisal system, and continuing to strengthen parent partnerships in learning. There has been very good progress in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children responsively lead their learning in a calm, settled environment. The well-resourced learning area has been carefully considered to support and extend their interests. Natural materials enhance children’s play, imagination and creativity. The outdoor space provides opportunities to be involved in physically challenging experiences. The centre’s environment is highly influenced by Emmi Pickler and the cultures of the children who attend.</p><p>Highly respectful and responsive teaching promotes the learning that matters in the centre. Literacy, mathematics, science and the arts are strongly visible in the learning spaces, actions and documentation. Strategies for developing social competence are promoted through a highly collaborative approach from teachers. Children know the expectations well.</p><p>A bicultural curriculum is evident. <span lang="mi">Te reo Māori</span> is visible in portfolio books and centre displays. Significant cultural days and events are acknowledged and celebrated across the centre community.</p><p>Teachers are highly responsive to individual children’s culture, language and identity. The multi-cultural teaching team enables children to converse in their home language while learning English.</p><p>There is a strong focus on sensory exploration and messy play appropriate to the learning needs of infants and toddlers. Children are supported to learn alongside their peers. Close liaison with families about care routines supports a tailored approach. Children’s preferences are respected. Calm and unhurried interactions promote a sense of belonging. Warm relationships between teachers and young children are clearly evident.</p><p>Regular excursions into the local area are highly valued, provide strong links to the community and extend learning opportunities for children.</p><p>A well-considered transition process supports children and families when starting at the centre. Children are provided with opportunities to visit local schools to prepare them for their next learning journey.</p><p>A purposeful, collaborative approach to planning the programme is evident. Group planning is informed by observations of learners. Teachers identify their urges and plan an appropriate response. Individual planning is based on emerging interests. Their stories document progress in relation to learning over time. Portfolios are accessible to children, allowing them to revisit their learning. Partnerships with parents are evident. Further consideration of how to document their aspirations and respond to these in assessment, planning and evaluation is an area for development.</p><p>A robust appraisal process, strongly linked to centre strategic priorities, is in place. Teacher practice is observed, and high-quality feedback is provided to build their capability. The managing director regularly delivers relevant, timely Professional Learning and Development (PLD). External PLD is aligned to the centre’s philosophy.</p><p>Staff are reflective and highly improvement focused. Collaborative self-review supports team discussion and reflection, and leads to enhancement in a range of areas. To strengthen the process, the team should use measurable success indicators, based on what effective practice looks like, to evaluate the impact of their practices on children's outcomes.</p><p>The managing director works effectively with the teaching team. Together they successfully foster a collective sense of responsibility to implement the philosophy of the service. The strategic plan effectively guides and underpins centre operations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre agree that next steps are to further strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>documentation of the response to parent aspirations in assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation linked to valued outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Palms Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>26 May 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
