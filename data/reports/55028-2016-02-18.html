</table><p>Since the February 2014 ERO report the Tairawhiti Playcentre Association (the association), has built their internal capacity to provide clear direction and targeted support for Wairoa and other playcentres in the association.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wairoa Playcentre is one of eight early childhood centres administered by the Tairawhiti Playcentre Association that oversees governance operations. A board of governors provides guidance and support for members. A liaison officer is employed by the board to visit playcentres and monitor how they are meeting legislative requirements.</p><p>The playcentre operates two mixed-age sessions weekly for a maximum of 30 children, including 13 children up to two years of age. Of the 21 children enrolled, five identify as Māori. A qualified teacher works alongside the parents to cooperatively provide the programme.</p><p>The February 2014 ERO report identified that significant improvement was needed particularly in the following: assessment, planning and evaluation; the bicultural curriculum; success for Māori as Māori; and self review. Members also needed to develop a shared understanding of policies and procedures that guide centre practice and an awareness of how literacy and numeracy experiences should enhance the programme. Key next steps were identified for the association that focused on ensuring the centre was effectively governed and managed.</p><p>Playcentre members and the board of governors at the association received targeted support through a Ministry of Education funded programme, Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO). The Playcentre Federation has also provided ongoing professional development related to the key next steps. Wairoa Playcentre had a full licence issued by the Ministry of Education in June 2015.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the Tairawhiti Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Playcentre members have made some progress in assessment, planning and evaluation, the bicultural programme and self review. They have also developed a clearer understanding of how the policies and procedures guide centre practice and have strengthened a focus on mathematics in the curriculum.</p><p>Children participate in a play-based programme. Adults work alongside their own and other children. They use a range of effective approaches to support and extend their play and learning. A designated and inviting play space is available for infants. Members consider and provide for the specific play requirements of this group. Descriptive language is used to extend children’s developing vocabulary.</p><p>An atmosphere of fun and exploration is evident. Children work alongside their peers, supporting one another in the activities they engage in. There are increased opportunities for children to be involved with and learn about mathematics. Adults use the opportunities that naturally arise to support children’s developing knowledge in this area. Strengthening the focus on literacy in a play-based setting is a next step for members.</p><p>The playcentre philosophy promotes: using children’s interests as a basis for planning; respectful relationships; and expresses a commitment to bicultural practice. This shared approach is led by the supervisor and is reflected in practice.</p><p>Recent improvements to the cycle of assessment, planning and evaluation are evident. The use of goals for children assists members to provide more specific support and extension for each child. It also assists them to focus their observations to show how they are supporting the child to reach their goal. Members should continue to strengthen this approach by having specific goals related to the child’s interest to focus learning. This should assist members in being able to more effectively evaluate the impact of the programme provided.</p><p>Members have engaged in ongoing learning to strengthen the bicultural programme. At times te reo Māori is spoken and aspects of tikanga Māori are evident. Continued development of the bicultural programme is required. This should include giving greater consideration of te ao Māori through the planning cycle and through children’s assessment information. The association has identified that a next step for them in supporting playcentres is to provide more strategic guidance in promoting success for Māori as Māori. ERO's evaluation affirms this planned development.</p><p>Spontaneous review is used to reflect on aspects of practice and focus improvements. Although some progress is evident, development is still required. Key next steps should include the association supporting members to further develop their understanding of the internal evaluation process. Once this is understood, members should be supported to shift from reviewing what they do, to evaluating how well practices support children’s learning.</p><p>Adults have an understanding of the implications of the changes required to meet the requirements of the <em>Vulnerable Children Act 2014</em>. The Playcentre Association has provided initial guidance in this area.</p><p>The board of governors demonstrates leadership in supporting playcentres in their understanding of legislative requirements. Monitoring of these requirements in the playcentre has been supported through the appointment of a liaison officer. In addition, the association has developed:</p><ul>
<li>an operational manual which provides policy guidance for members</li>
<li>appointment procedures</li>
<li>a system for police vetting</li>
<li>an appraisal process for employees</li>
<li>an approach for reviewing and evaluating the services' guiding documents and ongoing developments.</li>
</ul><p>The association has identified a next step is to develop an internet safety policy. ERO agrees that social networking and appointment policies should also be developed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The association should assist members to address the key next steps to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the emphasis on literacy through the play-based programme</li>
<li>continue to develop the assessment process to focus children’s learning</li>
<li>further develop the bicultural programme</li>
<li>build their understanding of the purpose and use of internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>provide greater strategic direction for centres in prompting success for Māori children as Māori</li>
<li>develop policies for social media and staff appointments.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the association support playcentre members to develop a plan that outlines how they will address the next steps identified in this report. ERO will monitor progress against the plan.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wairoa Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Wairoa Playcentre will be dependent on the progress the centre makes in relation to the action plan.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>18 February 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
