</table><p>Tamariki Akoranga is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tamariki Akoranga is an all-day bilingual, kaupapa Māori early education and care service. It is an integral part of the Taumarunui Community Kokiri Trust. The trust has been a Whānau Ora provider since 2010. The aspirations of the trust is to see all tamariki engaged in rangatiratanga, whanaungatanga, kaitiakitanga, wairuatanga, and taonga tuku iho. These are the foundation principles of this early learning environment. The centre is licensed for 58 tamariki including 15 under the age of two years. The current roll of 49 includes 27 Māori tamariki. The centre caters for tamariki from six months to school age in three age-based settings.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in 2015, the service opened another building in partnership with the Ministry of Education to provide an additional 19 places for tamariki aged four years to school-age. Leadership has remained the same and there have been significant changes to the teaching team. The centre is working on addressing the next steps identified in the last review concerning assessment, planning and evaluation, and developing teaching as inquiry.</p><p>Most kaiako are qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Tamariki benefit from a strong sense of belonging underpinned by an integrated kaupapa Māori philosophy. The wellbeing and learning of tamariki are nurtured in an inclusive and purposeful environment by responsive and caring kaiako. Kaiako take time to listen to tamariki and foster their language development in te reo Māori and English. All tamariki have opportunities to make choices, explore their surrounds and experience success. Culturally responsive practice in the centre affirms the philosophy, vision and values of the trust and the service.</p><p>Tamariki with additional needs are well catered for and kaiako work with specialist agencies to provide wrap-around support for them and their whānau. Kaiako actively demonstrate and promote whanaungatanga with tamariki and whānau and relationships are based on acceptance and inclusion. The wharekura outdoor environment is yet to be developed to provide suitable physical challenge and development for the older tamariki.</p><p>Babies and toddlers enjoy a calm, slow pace where they have the time and space to lead their learning. They have easy access to an environment that encourages exploration and experimentation. Kaiako are responsive to their subtle cues and model and encourage oral language development.</p><p>The curriculum is designed to realise the intent of the service's philosophy. Te Puawaitanga has been developed to integrate the core values of the trust, <em>Te Whāriki</em>, Te Whare Tapa Whā, and whānau aspirations. The key elements from these four funds of knowledge drive the programme. Most kaiako and kaiāwhina use te reo Māori naturally, demonstrating good models of the language for tamariki. Kaiako actively promote the principles of tuākana teina and ako. Less confident kaiako simultaneously learn and develop aspects of te ao Māori alongside tamariki. A high level of bicultural practice is evident and children's language, culture and identity as tangata whenua is celebrated. Tamariki show pride and enjoyment in waiata, haka and karakia. Assessment, planning and evaluation to reflect Te Puawaitanga and aspirations of whānau continues to require further review and refinement.</p><p>Leadership is committed to the philosophy and vision of providing a kaupapa Māori bilingual curriculum. Relationships are collaborative and based on respect, trust and reciprocity. Leaders need to fully implement the appraisal process.</p><p>The Taumarunui Community Kokiri Trust effectively sets the overall vision, philosophy and strategic direction of the centre, which are underpinned by their kaupapa Māori core values. They receive regular reports about how the philosophy is being enacted. The board strategically resources targeted professional development to build staff capability and capacity in kaupapa Māori. There is a need to further refine the strategic plan to make improved outcomes for children explicit and to embed effective internal evaluation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>adequately resource the wharekura to provide appropriate physical challenge and development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review and refine assessment, planning and evaluation to reflect whānau aspirations and progress over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embed all aspects of the appraisal process including targeted observations and documented professional feedback on practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure the documented policy and procedure for appraisal is fully implemented. This includes regular documented observations and professional feedback on practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make improved outcomes for children explicit in the strategic plan and embed effective internal evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tamariki Akoranga completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>12 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
