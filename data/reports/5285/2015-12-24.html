</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tamatea Kindergarten in Napier provides early childhood education and care for up to 46 children aged over two. Morning sessions cater for younger children and older children attend for six hours. The current roll comprises of 49 children, including 24 Māori children.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Napier Kindergarten Association, which oversees the operation of 16 kindergartens including two based in Wairoa. A board of trustees oversees governance for the association and support for the general manager. Two education managers are responsible for building teacher capability. The head teacher provides professional leadership to the team of teachers. A recently appointed Pou Whakarewa Matauranga supports teachers to develop their knowledge and understanding of te ao Māori. He demonstrates a clear vision for Māori children and their whānau.</p><p>Since the October 2012 review there have been a number of developments in the kindergarten. These have included upgrading the inside of the kindergarten and further developing the outdoor environment. This is stimulating and inviting and reflects the cultural identify of New Zealand and the natural world. Easy indoor outdoor flow and thoughtful placement of activities and resources support children’s learning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 9 reviews in the Napier Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and parents are warmly welcomed on arrival. Children are familiar with the routine and settle quickly. Warm, mutually respectful relationships are evident and reflect the kindergarten’s philosophy.</p><p>Teachers support children in engaged, sustained, child-led play. They access a good range of activities and resources which encourage exploration, investigation and creativity. Teachers foster language development through their conversations with children. Literacy and mathematics are well integrated throughout the daily programme. Routines are responsive to the children’s needs and promote independence and self-help skills.</p><p>Portfolios are attractive and effectively inform parents about their child’s learning and participation in a wide range of learning activities. Children enjoy revisiting them and sharing their learning.</p><p>Recent developments of planning and assessment practices have increased teachers’ focus on children’s learning. Teachers notice, recognise and respond to children’s strengths and emerging interests and plan appropriate learning experiences. Planning is well displayed in order to inform and engage parents in the programme.</p><p>Children’s learning over time is documented through learning journeys. This is a recently introduced initiative. Teachers have identified the need to continue to develop learning journeys to show the complexity of children’s learning over time. Learning journeys are increasing parent's contribution and engagement in their child’s learning.</p><p>Transitions into kindergarten are well planned and responsive to the individual needs of children and their families. Well-established relationships with local schools support children’s transition to school.</p><p>Teachers recognise and celebrate the importance of whanaungatanga. There has been a sustained focus on strengthening their knowledge and understanding of te ao Māori. A Māori vision articulates a belief in the uniqueness of Māori children. Teachers acknowledge that it is timely to review this vision to seek Māori parents and whānau aspirations for their children.</p><p>Children's learning is supported by reflective teachers who work collaboratively. The head teacher values the strengths and skills of individual teachers and encourages and supports them to take on leadership roles.</p><p>Teachers are well supported to participate in relevant professional learning and development. The appraisal process enables teachers to identify areas for further development and reflect on the impact of their practice. Further developing the focus of the appraisal process should increase its usefulness in growing teaching practices.</p><p>A useful self-review process has been developed by teachers to guide kindergarten developments. Good use is made of evidence and research. Establishing a clear focus, identifying desired outcomes for children and shifting their focus to how well practices support positive outcomes for children should further strengthen the process.</p><p>The association empowers teachers to use the team’s strengths to respond to children and the parent community. Education managers should continue to lead the implementation of systems and processes to effectively build teacher capability. These include assessment, planning, self-review and internal evaluation, appraisal and leadership.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The kindergarten teachers and education managers should:</p><ul>
<li>further embed and extend the scope of the self-review and internal evaluation processes</li>
<li>improve appraisal goal setting, evidence, observations, feedback and next steps.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tamatea Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tamatea Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>24 December 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
