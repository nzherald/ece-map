</table><p>Kindy Cottage Childcare is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindy Cottage Childcare is licensed to provide education and care for up to 26 children, including 12 children under the age of two years. There are two indoor areas. The Butterfly Room is for infants and toddlers, and the Caterpillar Room is for older children. Children in both rooms share the outdoor areas. A small number of children attending are Māori or from other ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>The centre's philosophy, underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, prioritises respect, responsibility and independence as important parts of children's learning. The philosophy is currently under review.</p><p>The centre changed ownership in 2018. The two co-owners have responsibility for the daily management of the centre. The teaching team consists of two head teachers and seven teachers, most of whom, including one of the owners, are registered teachers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled at the centre. They are confident and articulate, and enjoy friendships with others that enhance their social skills and oral language. Teachers work closely with children, engaging them in conversations and fostering their curiosity. They affirm children's ideas and encourage inquiry and problem-solving. The outdoor area is used well to extend learning through children's play.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well cared for. They confidently explore and enjoy their play in a calm, supportive, unrushed pace. They benefit from the mixed-age outdoor play opportunities. Their independence and self-management skills are nurtured through teachers' practices.</p><p>Teachers have responsive and caring relationships with children and provide a welcoming environment for families. They work collaboratively, communicating well and responding to children's needs. Learning experiences that encourage children to inquire are woven into the curriculum. Inclusive practices ensure that children with additional needs are well supported. Children's transitions into and through the centre are well considered and tailored to suit each child and family.</p><p>Teachers notice, recognise and respond to children's individual emerging interests. They continue to develop strategies to document and enhance their planning, assessment and evaluation practices. It would be worthwhile to strengthen the focus on extending children's learning and making this more visible in planning. Individual portfolios inform parents about their children's learning progress. Learning opportunities promoted through the centre's programme help children prepare for their transition to school.</p><p>Children's cultures are valued and teachers' commitment to bicultural practice is evident. Centre routines and the environment acknowledge the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. Teachers are building their knowledge of te ao Māori, and use words and phrases in te reo Māori with the children.</p><p>The owners and teachers are committed to ongoing improvement, and use internal evaluation to identify areas for further development. Focusing evaluative questions to explore ways to improve teaching practices and outcomes for children could contribute to a more strategic approach. A new appraisal system is being introduced to strengthen staff performance. Teachers are taking part in relevant professional development that impacts positively on their practice.</p><p>Centre owners have high expectations of their staff as professionals, and are working to develop a strong team culture. Centre operations are guided by a sound base of policies and procedures.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers being more intentional in their responses to children in order to challenge and extend children's thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing the extent to which Māori language and culture are evident in documentation and teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building a collaborative centre culture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the philosophy and establishing a strategic plan.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindy Cottage Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>6 June 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
