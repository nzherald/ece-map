</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edukids North Road is an education and care service that is owned by Kidicorp. It is licensed for up to 67 children, including 20 under two years. Families are drawn from a wide catchment area. </p><p>The purpose-built centre is divided into three classrooms. These include a nursery for infants and toddlers, a preschool room for children aged two-to-three and a half years old, and a ‘prep’ room for older children. Each room has head teacher who has overall responsibility for children’s education and care in that area. </p><p>This centre has been open for 15 months and has experienced a time of rapid growth. This has been competently managed by the centre manager. Six of the teachers are qualified, five are in training and five have no formal qualification.</p><p>The centre is owned and managed by the Kidicorp company. A regional business manager works with the centre manager. After a long vacancy, a professional services manager has been appointed to oversee professional support for teachers in this and other Kidicorp centres. </p><p>This is the centre’s first ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy is evident in what happens each day. Children are settled in their play and learning. The programme is child-centred and play based. Flexible routines support the children’s developing independence. Children enjoy an environment that encourages active exploration and regular literacy and musical experiences.</p><p>Teachers are warm and welcoming to children and their families. They know the children and their families well. They work closely with parents to help new children settle. Children confidently approach their teachers and teachers effectively support their developing social and emotional competence. They also encourage children to help each other with their learning.</p><p>Children’s successful transitions between the classrooms are planned with parents and carefully monitored by teachers. There are appropriate resources, learning experiences and support provided to older children to help them make a successful transition to school. Teachers are continuing to improve transition-to-school processes.</p><p>Infant and toddlers’ needs and interests are well responded to by the teachers. Resources in the outdoor area support children's physical development.</p><p>Teachers work alongside the children to support and extend their learning. Some teachers provide specific feedback to children and use effective questioning. Children’s cultural backgrounds are valued and teachers intentionally learn about and celebrate these.</p><p>Teachers are beginning to include aspects of te reo me ngā tikānga Māori in the programme. The next step is for leaders to strengthen this and then regularly review how well Māori language and culture is valued in the centre.</p><p>Centre leaders have identified that they want to better understand what success for Māori might look like at Edukids North Road. They plan to:</p><ul>
<li>look further at Kahikatia (the Ministry of Education strategy)</li>
<li>ask parents of Māori children to identify what they view as success for their child.</li>
</ul><p>Planning is responsive to children’s interests and used well to extend the curriculum. Learning could be strengthened through regular evaluation of programmes and using this information to inform future planning.</p><p>Well-presented portfolios highlight children’s involvement in the programme, developmental milestones, emerging relationships and, at times, dispositional learning. Teachers use a range of ways to gather parents’ perspectives and aspirations about their child’s learning.</p><p>The next step is to strengthen assessment records to better show:</p><ul>
<li>parents’ wishes for their children’s learning</li>
<li>how teachers respond to these</li>
<li>the teachers’ role in supporting children’s learning</li>
<li>how teachers have added depth and complexity to children’s learning over time.</li>
</ul><p>The centre manager understands the importance of relationships with parents, children and teachers. This has been a strong focus in the centre’s first year. Teacher’s strengths are recognised and used well to support others.</p><p>Teachers are developing their understanding of self review and evaluation. They have established a clear process for this and regularly seek input from parents. Leaders and teachers need to continue to build staff understanding of effective review to support ongoing improvement in the centre.</p><p>There is a strong commitment to developing staff skills through ongoing professional support and learning. This is based on teachers’ identified needs. Kidicorp has a detailed framework for staff appraisal and supporting provisionally-registered teachers. The next step is to better implement Kidicorp’s expectations in these areas.</p><p>Kidcorp’s frameworks, procedures and guidelines set out clear expectations for staff. In most areas these have been well implemented.</p><p>Centre leaders have identified several next steps to strengthen centre practices. These include:</p><ul>
<li>developing a strategic and annual plan that better reflects the centre’s priorities</li>
<li>undertaking staff appraisal in a timely and thorough way.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edukids North Rd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edukids North Rd will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>30 January 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
