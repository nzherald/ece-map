<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Mahurangi Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children through effective leadership, management, curriculum planning and teaching practices.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Mahurangi Kindergarten is located on the outskirts of Warkworth and supports a culturally and socially diverse community. ERO&rsquo;s 2009 report noted that children were confident learners benefitting from a stimulating programme. Teachers were keen to develop further strategies to challenge children. The kindergarten has a history of positive ERO reports.</p><p>Since 2009 the kindergarten has extended its hours of operation. In 2011 it was relicensed under the 2008 regulations to cater for up to 40 children aged over two years. There are four permanent, fully qualified and registered teachers supported by an administrator. Teachers have engaged in worthwhile professional development. Good practices have been maintained, and self review informs service improvement. Teachers know their children and wh&#257;nau well, and are very aware of community needs.</p><p>The North Auckland Kindergarten Association provides effective operational and management structures for the kindergarten. Association personnel provide ongoing support and professional guidance for teachers.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in four early childhood education services within the Northern Auckland Kindergarten Association umbrella organisation.</p><h3><strong>The Review Findings</strong></h3><p>There is a strong sense of community in the kindergarten. Teachers have respectful and trusting relationships with kindergarten families and well established connections with the local community. They work collaboratively to support children&rsquo;s learning and development. Parents appreciate the education and care that teachers provide. Teachers welcome wh&#257;nau involvement in their children&rsquo;s education. They keep them fully informed, and encourage them to share their strengths and ideas.</p><p>Children have fun and are confident, eager learners. Their creativity is nurtured through exploring art, dance, and music activities. Teachers use a range of strategies to support children&rsquo;s inquiry, including ways to use literacy, numeracy and science concepts in meaningful situations. Children are developing a good understanding of the natural world and a knowledge of environmental issues. They play actively and imaginatively in the outdoor area. Children share ideas and are developing a sense of empathy and social responsibility.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively to foster the learning and development of all children. They provide high quality programmes based on a culture of respect for children and their wh&#257;nau. Teachers are highly reflective and their practices align with the kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy. They share leadership opportunities and enthusiasm for continuous improvement for children. These factors should assist them as they consider further ways to enrich children&rsquo;s opportunities for deeper learning.</p><p>Children learn in a stimulating, well resourced learning environment that supports their sustained engagement in learning and play. The curriculum is based on <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood education curriculum framework and is strongly influenced by the local rural and coastal context. Teachers are aware that they could build on their use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori and review how bicultural practice is fostered in the programme.</p><p>Self review is well established, purposeful and meaningful. Teachers are well supported by the Association in maintaining a focus on promoting positive outcomes for children. The teaching services manager (TSM) provides effective liaison between the kindergarten and the Association. Her feedback through head teacher appraisals and visit reports contribute to teachers&rsquo; self review and strategic planning. Teachers agree that they could expand aspects of annual planning and increase the depth and variety of perspectives in their self-review processes.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mahurangi Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>19 December 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
