<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The centre managers and leaders are well placed to provide children with a programme and environment that meets their learning and wellbeing needs.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The centre has experienced major disruption since the February 2011 earthquakes. The centre was closed for several months. It is temporarily located at the local intermediate school. The current licence is a temporary one and expires in May 2013. There is an urgent need to find appropriate and permanent premises.</p><p>Centre managers have worked extremely hard to create inviting surroundings in the temporary premises. Children are provided with a safe and nurturing setting that is supporting their learning well. A warm, welcoming environment has seen most families return.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy is well developed and effectively guides teachers&rsquo; practices and children&rsquo;s learning. There is a focus on developing a caring supportive setting that is inclusive of children&rsquo;s cultural backgrounds and their individual needs. The philosophy has been recently reviewed to make sure it reflects the values and beliefs of parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>Teachers are skilled at building positive relationships with children and their parents. This is a strong feature within the centre that results in good levels of children&rsquo;s engagement in learning.</p><p>Teachers effectively notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s individual strengths and interests. They are able to use a range of teaching strategies to meet the children&rsquo;s learning needs. Parents are recognised and valued as first teachers.</p><p>Teachers have developed useful strategies and resources to help children transition into the centre, from the nursery to the over twos area, and on to school. The next step for leaders and teachers is to fully implement transition to school.</p><p>ERO observed in the nursery:</p><ul>
<li>nurturing relationships that foster children&rsquo;s sense of belonging and wellbeing</li>
<li>teachers constantly interacting with children to develop independence and oral language</li>
<li>good use of music as a feature of the programme.</li>
</ul><p>In the preschool ERO observed children:</p><ul>
<li>interacting confidently with teachers and other children</li>
<li>sharing their learning enthusiastically</li>
<li>engaging well in a range of activities.</li>
</ul><p>The culture and heritage of M&#257;ori children and their parents is recognised through frequent use of te reo M&#257;ori in conversations and instructions, involving children in mihi whakatau, and the integration of tikanga M&#257;ori into the curriculum and environment. M&#257;ori parents are given the opportunity to set expectations for their children. They are asked to share karakia that are included in centre booklets.</p><p>The curriculum reflects the goals of <em>Te Whariki</em> (New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum) and is soundly based on current good practice. Parents' aspirations for their children are reflected in planning. Teachers are well supported by professional development that is linked to children&rsquo;s learning and teachers&rsquo; needs. Teachers&rsquo; appraisal is robust. It promotes their self review and provides them with helpful feedback.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have good knowledge of teaching practices based on research and best practice. The centre has effective systems and processes in place for programme planning and assessment. Planning and monitoring children&rsquo;s individual learning pathways are strengths of the curriculum. Teachers work cooperatively to set and review learning goals for children and identify appropriate teaching strategies.</p><p>Children's learning stories:</p><ul>
<li>have good links to prior learning</li>
<li>build from children&rsquo;s interests and include their point of view</li>
<li>are linked to show progress</li>
<li>reflect developments in early literacy and numeracy</li>
<li>identify next learning steps.</li>
</ul><p>The centre manager and head teacher are experienced and provide strong leadership. They are well supported by a capable parent management committee that works cooperatively with the staff to achieve successful outcomes for children. Teachers' strengths are recognised and they are given opportunities to develop leadership roles.</p><p>The centre has developed an approach to self review that supports a reflective culture. The review process effectively identifies what is going well. It includes plans for the future to improve outcomes for children.</p><p>The next steps to help strengthen strategic planning and self review are to:</p><ul>
<li>complete the development of the new strategic plan</li>
<li>make sure there are good connections between strategic goals, annual planning, teachers&rsquo; appraisal and self review</li>
<li>identify and prioritise the review of strategic goals</li>
<li>make sure the review of curriculum developments and teaching strategies remain central within review plans.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bishopdale Community Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.Click here to enter text.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>3 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
