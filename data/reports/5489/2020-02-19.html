</table><p>Abbotsford Kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Abbotsford Kindergarten provides early childhood education for children aged two years old to school age. It is licensed for 43 children and currently has a roll of 50. Sessions operate from 8.30am to 2.30pm.</p><p>Teachers aim to support children to demonstrate the kindergarten's values of empathy, kindness, compassion and respect. In addition, they aim that children are supported to become active explorers, risk-takers, thinkers and problem solvers, with a positive attitude to learning.</p><p>Teachers plan to achieve these outcomes through building respectful, reciprocal relationships and learning partnerships with children and families, valuing the uniqueness of each child, having a positive and strengths-based view of children and through reciprocal teaching and learning.</p><p>The teaching team has made very good progress in addressing the areas for development identified in the kindergarten's December 2015 ERO review. These included strengthening systems and practices for individual and group planning, internal evaluation, delivery of a bicultural curriculum, partnerships with families and building a positive team culture.</p><p>Abbotsford Kindergarten is one of 24 kindergartens governed by Dunedin Kindergartens (DK). Day-to-day operations are led by a head teacher, who is new since the kindergarten's last review, with the support of five experienced, qualified teachers. A senior teacher from DK provides support for professional and operational practice.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 11 DK kindergartens reviewed at the end of 2019.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families show a strong sense of belonging to the kindergarten. Supportive, warm and affirming relationships contribute to positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers have a positive view of all children, and strongly focus on fostering social competence. Their interactions effectively support children’s communication skills, oral language and early literacy. Skilled questioning provokes children’s deeper thinking and experimentation.</p><p>Children benefit from a broad and rich curriculum which is responsive to their interests and identified needs, parent aspirations and valued learning within the kindergarten. Key features include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>well-balanced opportunities for vigorous and active movement, including risk taking, exploration and challenge, and quiet, calm times</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>respect for people, places and things, including te ao Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>early literacy and creativity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a strong focus on social and emotional competence, health and wellbeing and learning about the natural world.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The language and culture of Māori children are well recognised in the programme and in individual planning. Children with additional learning needs are very well supported in their health, wellbeing and learning. Teachers are proactive in seeking and working with external experts and agencies and parents to enhance these children's learning and development. There is a strong focus on equity for children and their families.</p><p>Children's continuity of learning is effectively planned for. Assessment and planning are underpinned by sound principles and reflect the whole child as a learner, in relation to the kindergarten’s learning priorities. Teachers have improved systems to ensure all children have meaningful goals, which are known and evaluated by all teachers and children's parents. Teachers could refine group planning by aligning the intended learning and planned teaching strategies to <em>Te Whāriki</em> - the Early Childhood Curriculum.</p><p>Teachers and children are benefiting from the strong focus the head teacher has on building and supporting professional practice. She has high and clear expectations for teaching and learning. Systems for the smooth operation of the centre, including assessment, planning and evaluation, appraisal and kindergarten management, have been strengthened. The head teacher and team have developed and implemented long-term planning for the future direction of the kindergarten that is well aligned to DK's strategic goals. This planning recognises that it is timely to review the kindergarten's philosophy. This process should include clarifying agreed priorities for children's learning at the kindergarten.</p><p>There is a strong focus on continuous improvement throughout the centre. Internal evaluation is well informed by research, professional learning and the support of the senior teacher. Emergent reviews are purposeful. Teachers collaborate as part of internal evaluation processes. These lead to actions and improvement. The key outcomes of internal evaluations are appropriately shared with those involved in the kindergarten. As part of planned or regular reviews, teachers should continue to strengthen the use of evaluative thinking linked to relevant indicators.</p><p>The board of DK has made good progress in addressing the governance recommendations from ERO's 2015-2016 reviews. DK's mission and strategic priorities are well known and reflected in each kindergarten's strategic and annual plans. It has a sound policy and procedure framework that provides guidance for kindergartens and sound systems to monitor health and safety. Leaders and teachers benefit from relevant professional development and leadership support. DK actively supports equity of outcomes for all children by funding additional teaching resources to support children with additional needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>2020 signals the beginning of another strategic planning cycle for the kindergarten. The kindergarten has indicated that this will involve significant consultation with its community to identify future goals.</p><p>Group planning and evaluation could show better use of <em>Te Whāriki</em> - the Early Childhood Curriculum, to identify and evaluate the intended learning and planned teaching strategies.</p><p>The DK board has clearly identified, and ERO agrees, that the key next steps for DK to further improve outcomes for children are to ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>reporting and monitoring at all levels are evaluative, to clearly show how desired outcomes for children have been improved in relation to DK's and kindergartens' priorities for learning and other strategic priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a robust and systematic quality assurance framework is implemented to inform and monitor ongoing improvements in each kindergarten.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Abbotsford Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Southern)</p><p><span>Southern Region - Te Tai Tini</span></p><p>19 February 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 614px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
