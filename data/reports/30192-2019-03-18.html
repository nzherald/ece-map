</table><p>Central City Quality Edu-care Ltd requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Governance and leadership requires strengthening to improve key aspects of centre practice and teacher capability. This includes strengthening self-review, implementing a robust teacher appraisal process and accessing relevant professional development. Accurate records of all centre documentation need to be kept.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central City Quality Edu-care (Pukuatua St) is a mixed- age, all day education and care service, located in Rotorua. It is licensed for 27 children, including up to 8 under the age of two years. At the time of this review 28 children were enrolled, including 13 who identify as Māori.</p><p>The centre is one of two under the same private ownership. The director, who is a qualified teacher, supports both centre managers and a small teaching team, which includes qualified and unqualified teachers.</p><p>Through their philosophy, teachers aim to promote a safe, caring and healthy environment where children are supported to develop life skills working alongside their peers. Teachers aim to give children time and space to play and develop social skills. Te reo and tikanga Māori are promoted and all cultures are respected within the centre. Teachers aim to form strong connections between home and centre.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in March 2016, little progress has been made in developing and implementing an appropriate teacher appraisal system. Centre leadership has not reviewed assessment and evaluative processes. A strategic and annual plan has been developed, however, these require further strengthening.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Warm relationships have been developed among children, whānau, teachers and leaders. Low staff turnover contributes to continuity of care for children. Inclusive teaching practices support all children, including those with additional needs, to participate in centre activities. Oral language development is supported through waiata, karakia, and teachers reading and conversing with children. Teachers are responsive to the care needs of children. Infants under the age of two benefit from nurturing relationships with teachers. Children have developed a sense of belonging at the centre.</p><p>Curriculum design needs strengthening to align with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. A range of activities are offered within the centre; however, consideration should be given to the development of more opportunities for children to lead their own learning and to provide increasing levels of challenge for children. Te reo and tikanga Māori are evident in centre activities and routines. Exploration of children's whakapapa and making links to local iwi would further strengthen the bicultural curriculum and support success for Māori learners. A settled environment supports tuakana teina opportunities, fostering the development of natural relationships between older and younger children.</p><p>The assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning needs to be strengthened. Further support is required for teachers to plan and scaffold individual learning pathways for children. This includes increasing recognition of and response to children's language, culture and identity, and the frequency of individual learning stories to show continuity and progression of learning over time.</p><p>Leadership to support professional practice needs strengthening. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>building the capability of teachers through targeted professional development aligned with the centre's strategic plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing teachers' knowledge and use of <em>Te Whāriki</em> to underpin curriculum design and the development of a localised curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring self-review processes are regular and rigorous, and evaluate outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>There is a culture of relational trust and collaboration between leaders and teachers.</p><p>Aspects of centre management require improvement. A vision has been developed and the philosophy and policies are reviewed annually. There is a need to strengthen the documentation of these reviews and consult with all stakeholders, including parents. Systems and processes are in place to guide health and safety practice. Leaders must ensure that accurate records are kept relating to these systems. Strategic and annual plans have been developed. The annual plan requires strengthening to show clearer alignment to the vision and the new three-year strategic plan, and to guide centre operations focused on ongoing improvements. An urgent priority for the service is to fully develop and implement an appraisal system to ensure that teacher capability is supported and that the endorsement of teacher registrations is compliant with relevant legislation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps for Central City Quality Edu-care (Pukuatua) are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>support teachers to use the revised <em>Te Whāriki</em> to review the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve self-review practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve systems to maintain accurate records and documentation relating to health and safety, and policy and philosophy review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement a robust appraisal system for teachers.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central City Quality Edu-care Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to appraisal and the endorsement for teacher registration, safety and police checking of workforce, and curriculum. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure that a system of regular appraisal is documented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>safety checking and police vetting for non-registered teachers is undertaken for all core and non-core children's workers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide a curriculum which is consistent with <em>Te Whāriki</em> and informed by assessment, planning and evaluation that demonstrates an understanding of children's learning, their interests, whānau and life contexts.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7, GMA7A, C1, C2.</em></p><p>In order to improve practice, accurate records need to be consistently kept for earthquake drills and sleep monitoring. (HS8, HS9).</p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>18 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
