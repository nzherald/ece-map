</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Campbell Kindergarten is located in Karori, Wellington. It provides education and care for children aged from two to five years. Six-hour daily sessions are offered five days a week. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 40 children.</p><p>All teachers are qualified and registered. The programme is further assisted by support staff. Since the January 2012 ERO evaluation, a new head teacher has been appointed. The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>The Kindergarten is one of 85 kindergartens and three home-based education and care networks governed and managed by He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). This is a new kindergarten association created from joining the Rimutaka and Wellington Kindergarten Associations in 2014.</p><p>The board and managers provide governance for the organisation. Senior teachers have delegated kindergartens. Their role is to provide regular support and a range of professional learning and development opportunities for teachers.</p><p>In 2012, the association developed a framework to guide the implementation of its curriculum, Te Manawa. This document outlines criteria for curriculum delivery including expectations for assessment and planning for children’s learning.</p><p>The previous ERO report for Campbell Kindergarten identified that assessment, planning and evaluation required strengthening. Considerable progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>Areas where the association could strengthen its support for teachers were also identified, and positive progress has occurred. The alignment of individual kindergartens’ annual plans with the association’s strategic priorities has now been appropriately addressed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua kindergartens. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten's philosophy is highly evident in practice. Children are learning to be responsible, to share, explore, take risks and to play as a good friend. Teachers know children well. They promote children's emerging interests in literacy and mathematics. A useful a range of effective teaching strategies support children's learning.</p><p>Leaders and teachers effectively respond to diverse cultures at the kindergarten. Children's cultures are appropriately reflected in the environment, resources and celebrations. Teachers work well with families, whānau and external agencies to support children with additional learning needs. They are fully included in the programme.</p><p>Strong relationships with whānau Māori and the wider community have been developed. Parents and whānau regularly participate in and contribute to their child's learning. Whānau expertise is used to extend the programme. Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori is highly valued, promoted and well established in the kindergarten. Teachers use te reo Māori in general conversation with children who show confidence in using te reo with teachers and their peers.</p><p>Planning is responsive to children's interests, skills, previous learning and friendships. Teachers are continuing to reflect on their approach to planning to ensure it is meaningful for children's learning.</p><p>Learning stories are useful records of children's participation and friendships in the programme. These increasingly show children's learning and progress overtime. Links to whānau and parent aspirations and use of children's voices are key features of these stories. Leaders have identified areas where consistency in assessment practice should continue to be strengthened to show greater progression and complexity in children's learning. ERO's external evaluation affirms this direction.</p><p>Leaders value, promote and lead self review. They focus on improving the quality of education and care through ongoing, systematic internal evaluation. The head teacher promotes a culture of reflection and inquiry. She values the skills of teachers and supports them in taking leadership roles within the kindergarten. </p><p>Children and families are well supported to settle into the kindergarten at their own pace. Relationships are well established with local schools to enable children's smooth transition to school. </p><p>The senior teacher provides termly written feedback that outlines agreed development priorities and progress in relation to the quality of teaching and learning. She completes an annual internal evaluation that supports strengthening of these termly reports. There is a deliberate focus on outcomes for children and teacher/leader performance.</p><p>The previous report identified that the association needed to improve the appraisal processes. Managers undertook an internal review of the appraisal system. The revised model is being implemented across the kindergartens. The process includes focused goals that build teacher and leader capability and clearer links with the Practising Teacher Criteria. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher, staff and ERO agree that key next step for Campbell Kindergarten is to continue to strengthen assessment practice through internal evaluation.</p><p>The association should continue to support the development of formal critique of teaching practice.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Campbell Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Campbell Kindergarten will be in four years. </p><p>Joyce Gebbie<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>9 August 2016 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
