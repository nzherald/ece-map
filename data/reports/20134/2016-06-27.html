</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Eastern Bays E C (EBEC) Learning Centre is part of East City Community Trust and operates in the ASB Stadium in Kohimarama. The centre provides all-day and sessional education and care, and caters for 38 children, including up to five under the age of two years. The centre operates with generous staffing so that very favourable adult: child ratios are maintained.</p><p>The management board for the centre is made up of members from the Orakei Local Board of the Auckland City Council, representatives of the sports groups who use the stadium, Selwyn College and a community board member. Management of the centre is largely delegated to the centre manager who reports regularly to the board through the stadium manager.</p><p>The philosophy for the centre, developed by the teaching team in consultation with parents, is strongly based on the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The philosophy clearly outlines aspirational goals to guide teaching practices and relationships. The sports arena environment offers further opportunities for extended sporting experiences.</p><p>ERO's 2013 report acknowledged the positive and caring relationships between teachers and children that remain evident. Teachers have continued to develop their bicultural knowledge and practice, and continued to work at deepening self-review processes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are warm and welcoming towards children and parents. Good relationships are paramount in the centre. Children settle quickly and are comfortable in their surroundings. Teachers know and value the children and their parents/whānau.</p><p>The learning environment promotes the natural world and supportive relationships between children, whānau and teachers. Children have easy access to a variety of appropriate man-made and natural resources. Discrete areas are set up by teachers to offer children more choice of activities. Children have opportunities for individual, collaborative and parallel play. Mixed age play is encouraged and valued. The outside area is well used and children have good opportunities for physical challenge. Children experience uninterrupted play with unobtrusive centre routines.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to individual children's needs. They plan on the basis of observations of children's interests and learning dispositions, working collaboratively to follow up on children's interests and to extend their learning. Opportunities for creative, imaginative and dramatic play are included in the programme. Risky play is encouraged, and carefully monitored, to build on children's experiences and to challenge their thinking. Teachers make good use of the environment and its surrounds. Frequent excursions give children the opportunity to explore and use their natural environment and the surrounding community.</p><p>Teachers are building shared knowledge, resources and confidence in te reo Māori and the bicultural curriculum. These could now be integrated more naturally into the course of the day.</p><p>Teachers work alongside children and reinforce their efforts, encouraging them to have a go. Teachers engage with children very effectively with individualised respectful conversations. Some teachers use open-ended questions to extend maths and literacy concepts within the context of child-led play. The challenge for teachers now is to review how consistently they extend children's thinking, and to consider ways to engage boys more actively in the programme.</p><p>Teachers provide a specific programme for children over four. Consideration needs to be given to ensure that this programme relates to the principles and aims of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, and promotes learning in play contexts.</p><p>The centre manager is establishing an organisational culture that is conducive to ongoing improvement. The service has an up-to-date policy framework that guides practice. Self review for improvement is strategically and spontaneously implemented. Good guidelines are used to focus reviews. The next step in developing this process would be to be more evaluative in relation to outcomes for children, and identify a time to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of the changes made.</p><p>The centre manager is introducing a new performance management system with an increased emphasis on professional practice. The appraisal and support system could be further strengthened by teachers more regularly reflecting on the impact of their practice, and by deepening professional collaboration through mentoring and coaching. This capacity building would enable the service to sustain quality and improve outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre managers agree that the priorities for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increasing the focus on <em>Te Whāriki</em> in the programme as part of their drive to respond to children's interests and enhance their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing professional development to grow leadership capability and sustainability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further developing internal evaluation by using research and theory to support ongoing improvements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing long-term strategic planning to develop alignment with management processes such as annual plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving the quality of appraisal procedures.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Eastern Bays E C (EBEC) Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Eastern Bays E C (EBEC) Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>27 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
