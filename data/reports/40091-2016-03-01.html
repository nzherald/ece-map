</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hi Jinks Montessori is a privately owned early childhood service that has been operating in Rotorua for 27 years. The centre has been recently extended to include a new purpose-built classroom. It has been re-licensed to provide education and care for up to a maximum of 75 children over the age of two. The roll is increasing and at present includes 37 children, of whom 6 are identified as Māori, mostly affiliated with Te Arawa. The centre provides parents with flexible options, including half-day or full-day sessions.</p><p>The highly experienced owner/directress continues to provide knowledgeable and well-considered leadership for the centre and its parent community. She retains responsibility for all governance and management matters. The owner/directress is well supported by a team of long-serving teachers, including a head teacher. Teachers are trained in Montessori early childhood education, and three are fully qualified. The directress and staff have responded positively to the area for development in the 2012 ERO report relating to formalising self-review processes. Staff successfully managed centre operations and sustained the programme for children while the directress was away for an extended period.</p><p>The centre philosophy embraces ‘everything that we do’ and integrates Montessori and <em>Te Whāriki</em> curricula. It includes a focus on supporting children to be active learners, able to communicate, accept challenges and develop independence. Parents are warmly welcomed into the centre and teachers spend time talking with them about their child’s care and education. Parents choose the Montessori model of early childhood education through informed choice and are provided with extensive information about the centre programme, events and activities.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Hi Jinks Montessori Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The Montessori curriculum is highly evident in the learning environment and effectively facilitated by experienced and competent teachers. Children are able to independently access activities such as practical life and sensorial experiences, environmental activities, and language and mathematics learning. Teachers focus on the development of children’s senses, critical thinking, daily life skills, and character development. These developments guide teacher’s responses to children’s learning and behaviour and result in a calm, settled learning environment.</p><p>Children are able to initiate their own learning and play activities, and are empowered to independently manage their own care routines. Teachers help children to work with prepared resources and equipment and support their interaction with the natural environment. Children are confident communicators who play both independently and collaboratively. They make their views and needs known to adults who promote their social competencies and positive behaviour. Children, guided by teachers, were able to sustain their play, both in the indoor environment and outside, for considerable periods of time.</p><p>Children enjoy respectful and affirming relationships with adults who respond to their physical and emotional needs. They develop a strong sense of identify and belonging. Staff respond appropriately to children from different cultural backgrounds. Children have benefitted from teachers increased confidence and competence in te reo and tikanga Māori.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively in helping children interact with the prepared environment while responding to their emerging interests and strengths. Children with special learning requirements are well supported by caring teachers and appropriate external expertise. Teachers have engaged in professional learning in developing self-review strategies, with a particular focus on extending literacy experiences for children. Each teacher has initiated their own inquiry question related to the overall focus. Children are benefitting from the improvements in practice and programme resulting from strengthened self review.</p><p>Children’s learning is carefully observed and recorded in individual learning stories and plans. These are shared with parents along with considerable information about the curriculum. Children are able to access their portfolios and revisit their learning with the support of their parents and teachers. They are well supported as they transition to school.</p><p>The owner/directress has successfully established and maintained relationships of mutual trust and confidence with parents. She has well-developed educational networks, especially with the Montessori Association. Teachers feel well supported and valued.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The directress and ERO agree that the outdoor learning environment is the next area for strategic review and development. This should allow increased opportunity for children to experience all aspects of the <em>Te Whāriki</em> and Montessori curricula.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hi Jinks Montessori Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hi Jinks Montessori Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>1 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
