</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Park Estate Kindergarten is located in Papakura and is in temporary premises awaiting a rebuild. It is currently licensed for 25 children two years of age and over. The centre operates from 8:45am to 2:45pm.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association (CMKA) and operates under its policies and management framework. A CMKA education manager (EM) visits the kindergarten and provides leadership and curriculum support for teachers. The CMKA is in the process of reviewing its structures and operational framework.</p><p>The community is culturally diverse with many Māori and Pacific families. The kindergarten's philosophy values manaakitanga and whanaungatanga. Teachers aim to establish trusting relationships with children and their parents and whānau. They focus on environmental sustainability through being an 'Enviro-school'.</p><p>The teaching team includes an acting head teacher and two other registered teachers. An administrator and a teacher aide support the teaching team.</p><p>The 2014 ERO review identified a variety of good practices that continue to be evident. It also noted that teachers' goals for further development included strengthening self review and learning partnerships with whānau.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews in the CMKA.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy many opportunities to share their ideas and strengths with others. They are developing respect and understanding for others of differing backgrounds and abilities. Children are confident to lead and play in groups and establish friendships. They make choices and engage in sustained play for long periods of time.</p><p>Teachers have successfully created a sense of belonging for children and families by intentionally placing significant artefacts and resources from the old kindergarten in the temporary premises. This has helped to create a strong sense of community and shared purpose in the kindergarten.</p><p>Children are becoming self-managing learners. Teachers carefully organise the environment in response to children's interests and ideas. Their caring and supportive interactions help to build children's social and emotional skills and competence. Teachers encourage children to make choices and be independent.</p><p>Teachers provide opportunities for learning through play, and promote children's oral language. They assist children to learn about literacy, mathematics, science and technology concepts in meaningful ways. Children are well-supported as they transition to school.</p><p>Teachers build on children's interests by providing relevant activities and their documentation shows how children's views are used in planning for learning. Children’s portfolios record their engagement in the programme and some include child and parent input.</p><p>Teachers are inclusive and promote bicultural practices. Te ao Māori and Pacific languages and cultures are valued and fostered. Children have a range of opportunities to learn about cultural celebrations, art, music and dance.</p><p>The acting head teacher provides supportive professional leadership and encourages all staff to take leadership opportunities. Good support from the EM has contributed to the maintenance of consistent practices through changes of staff and premises.</p><p>CMKA strategic goals and the kindergarten's annual planning guide improvements in teaching practice, learning environments and outcomes for children and their whānau. Leaders and teachers are developing a shared understanding about important priorities for learning at the kindergarten through exploring <em>Te Whāriki</em> (2017), the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Well-established CMKA management systems, policies and processes guide the kindergarten's practices. Embedding the practice of regular documented observations into CMKA appraisal processes would enhance the support provided for teachers' professional growth.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers have identified key next steps that include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen their understanding about implementation of <em>Te Whāriki</em> (2017)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a more robust process of internal evaluation that involves deeper analysis of the effectiveness and impact of teacher practice on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make the continuity of children's learning more evident in key documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>CMKA leaders agree that their next steps are to continue:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>providing consistent ongoing support for leaders and teachers that sustains leadership and improves teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the revised early childhood curriculum, to identify priorities for learning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting teachers to increase the visibility of children's cultural identity and continuity of learning in their individual portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building capability and depth in internal evaluation across the association.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Park Estate Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Park Estate Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>17 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
