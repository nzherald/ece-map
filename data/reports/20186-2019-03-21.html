</table><p>Creative Kids is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Creative Kids is a well-established, family owned centre located in Beach Haven on Auckland's North Shore. It provides education and care for infants, toddlers and children up to school age. It is licensed for up to 60 children, including 15 up to the age of two years.</p><p>The philosophy of the centre is guided by <em>Te</em> <em>Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. It identifies a commitment to developing children in an environment that inspires and empowers them to think, investigate and be active participants in their learning.</p><p>Since the 2015 ERO report, the centre has a new owner and there have been changes in the teaching team. There has been significant building restructuring and environment redesign inside and outside, including a new room with a purpose-built outside area for infants and toddlers.</p><p>The centre has responded positively to the recommendations in the 2015 ERO report. Many of the positive comments from the last ERO report continue to be a feature of the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and families are warmly welcomed when they arrive at the centre. They experience respectful relationships that promote a sense of belonging. Children are confident and see themselves as capable learners. Inclusive practices ensure all children, including those with additional learning needs, are valued and well supported.</p><p>Children experience spacious and inviting environments that promote opportunities for exploration and imagination. They have access to high quality resources. Teachers foster children's independence and promote self-management skills.</p><p>Children are involved in leading and contributing to the programme. Older children are friendly, curious and confident. Tuakana/teina relationships are well promoted. Children engage in sustained play, show high levels of concentration, and are supported to develop their problem solving and thinking skills. Teachers use skilful questioning techniques to extend children's vocabulary and understanding. Literacy, mathematics, science and creative arts are promoted in meaningful ways that engage children. Teachers foster smooth transitions for children attending the local school.</p><p>Infants and toddlers experience respectful, nurturing relationships with staff. Their individual developments are celebrated and well documented in learning stories. Teachers help children form relationships with others. Children are well supported as they transition into and through the centre.</p><p>Tikanga Māori concepts and te reo Māori are reflected in the programme and environment. Teachers' knowledge of tikanga Māori is reflected in the depth of bicultural practices in the centre.</p><p>Teachers regularly write good quality learning stories that provide parents and whānau with a valuable record of their children's learning, strengths and interests. Learning stories recognise and celebrate children's milestones. Parents and whānau have access to relevant information about children's participation in centre programmes. Well documented assessment portfolios, planning and wall displays inform them about their children's progress. Parents and whānau are regularly consulted and have opportunities to contribute their perspectives to the centre's curriculum.</p><p>Leaders promote a shared understanding of the centre's philosophy, vision and goals. Teachers are highly reflective and continually seek ways of improving their practices. The newly formed teaching teams work collaboratively. Teachers are supported to take on leadership roles. Their individual strengths are valued and contribute to the quality of education and care. Leaders and teachers participate in a range of relevant professional learning and development opportunities. Leaders have strengthened performance management processes. Teachers' goals align to strategic goals and professional development opportunities.</p><p>The centre is well led and governed. Leaders set high expectations for themselves and staff. The centre has an effective policy framework and systems that guide its overall operation. Internal evaluation is used effectively to inform ongoing improvement. Strategic and annual planning guides centre operations. To further support the centre's strategic direction, it would be timely to refine strategic goals and identify ways to evaluate progress towards these.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers agree that key next steps are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to build the curriculum leadership team to help sustain quality practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refining strategic goals and measuring the impact of these over time.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Creative Kids completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>21 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
