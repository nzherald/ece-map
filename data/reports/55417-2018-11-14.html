</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Discovery Preschool Ltd is a privately owned early learning service in Avalon, Lower Hutt. It is licensed for 30 children aged over two years. Of the 29 children enrolled at the time of this ERO review, 14 identify as Māori.</p><p>In early 2017, the service was bought by Adhikar Enterprises Limited. The new owners are focused on providing quality education and care and attend professional training to increase their understanding of best practice in early childhood. Developments and improvements have resulted in enhanced indoor and outdoor environments for children and adults.</p><p>Since the November 2016 ERO report, the centre has experienced a significant number of staff and leadership changes. A new centre manager and centre coordinator provide overall curriculum guidance for the teaching team. Four teachers have an early childhood qualification and full certification. One educator has a certificate in early childhood practice (level 4).</p><p>The centre philosophy highlights the concepts of 'Whakamanawa, Whanaungatanga, Manaakitanga, Ākonga and Auahatanga' to express expectations for teaching practice and how children's learning and development will be supported. Currently the philosophy is being reviewed to align with the owners', teachers' and whānau values and beliefs.</p><p>The previous report identified a number of areas requiring considerable improvement. These included building management and teachers' capability in:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum development and delivery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promoting success for Māori and Pacific children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a robust appraisal process to support teachers professional growth and improving teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using internal evaluation to promote improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Significant progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The programme for children is strongly underpinned by respect and empowerment, and enables teachers to nurture and build positive, trusting relationships with learners and their whānau.</p><p>Teachers capture each child’s development through regular and useful assessment. They work collaboratively to develop an understanding of each child as a unique participant in the centre’s learning community. Whānau are beginning to share in and respond to their child’s on-line assessment information. Responsive teachers support children’s social and emotional progress.</p><p>Children are confident and active participants in learning. They make choices about play and set challenges for themselves. Children initiate interactions and conversations with their peers and adults. They develop tuakana teina relationships through regular engagement with others and are enthusiastic learners.</p><p>In collaboration with management and teachers, Māori children and their whānau are leaders in bicultural learning at the centre. Their language, culture and identities have a special place in the environment and programme. Te reo Māori is naturally incorporated into conversations with children. Teachers continue to investigate further ways to promote te ao Māori in a local, place-based context.</p><p>Teachers work responsively with children who are identified with diverse needs for learning. An inclusive environment acknowledges, and is respectful of, the range of ethnic groups in the centre. Teachers continue to find strategies to engage and support those requiring additional learning support.</p><p>Continuity between home, centre and school is acknowledged by teachers as important to children's developing confidence, competence and capabilities that transfer to the classroom. They continue to seek ways to strengthen these relationships.</p><p>Leadership is collaborative and improvement focused. The owners have a clear vision for the centre that is well communicated. The centre manager and teaching team are developing a culture, based on mutual respect and skills that encourages children’s learning.</p><p>Practices to support continuing improvement and evaluate progress are consolidating. Focused professional development has helped the manager to work well with her team to develop a shared understanding of effective practice. Strategic planning identifies priorities and associated goals aligned to the service's annual plan. A new appraisal system supports developing deliberate strategies for working towards goals and links to relevant training. The process has the potential to enhance teachers' professional growth and positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owners, manager and ERO agree on the following key next steps for Discovery Preschool Ltd, to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further embed assessment, planning and evaluation practices to guide future teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fully implement all teachers' appraisal to enhance outcomes for children and their whānau.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Discovery Preschool Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Discovery Preschool Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>14 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
