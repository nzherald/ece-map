<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><p>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</p><p>Whitford Early Learning Centre is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. A focus on improvement, along with changes to the centre&rsquo;s configuration and age range of children attending, has supported teachers to strengthen and refine their practices to a high level.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Whitford Early Learning Centre operates as one of three centres on a rural site. The business has been sold since its 2009 ERO review. In consultation with staff and parents, the new owners have made considerable and well considered changes to all three centres. One of the owners has the role of manager. She has begun an effective process of review and development to ensure that all administrative and operational policies and procedures are streamlined and systematic.</p><p>Changes for this centre have been welcomed by the teaching staff and parents. The need to rationalise the available space and to develop a clear focus on what would most benefit children has guided the changes. The Tui and Fantail rooms now cater for infants and children up to three years of age in attractive, age-appropriate settings.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled, happy and well cared for. The curriculum programmes across the two rooms are child-focused and planned to maximise enjoyable learning in the context of play. Routines are calmly followed, and children are confident and trusting with adults.</p><p>The inclusion of children with diverse needs is a particular strength of the centre. High expectations and skilled teaching help all children to achieve and learn to their potential. All children benefit from the nurturing environment generated by teachers. Learning programmes are appropriate and challenging for children. Children&rsquo;s independence is fostered and children are beginning to have a sense that they are capable and competent learners.</p><p>Teachers include early literacy, science and mathematics at appropriate levels for all children as part of play. Teachers&rsquo; in-depth knowledge about the children they teach is reflected in their purposeful planning. Assessment portfolios are well presented, interesting records of children&rsquo;s participation, and are valued by families and children.</p><p>Systems for ensuring seamless transitions within the centre and throughout the complex have helped strengthen relationships and supportive sharing between teachers. These improvements have been professionally useful and empowering to staff.</p><p>Teachers have had a focus on further developing bicultural understandings and practices in the centre. They are becoming more confident in helping children appreciate the dual cultural heritage of New Zealand, in keeping with <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood education curriculum.</p><p>Self-review practices are developing well. The manager has a clear understanding of how self review underpins improvement. Teachers review their own practices, and also review and discuss current good practice from external readings. These self-review actions enhance teachers&rsquo; professional growth and further strengthen teaching programmes.</p><p>The centre is well managed and ably led. The owners promote high quality programmes and support for children and their families. Parents speak highly of the strong partnership they have with the centre.</p><p>As next steps, ERO and centre leaders discussed the value of:</p><ul>
<li>further developing self-review processes and embedding new policies and procedures</li>
<li>continuing to focus on learning when planning and evaluating programmes</li>
<li>continuing to focus on the learning of individual children when completing learning stories.</li>
</ul><p>ERO endorses the owners&rsquo; plans to improve the outdoor learning area.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Whitford Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>28 November 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p><h3>Disclaimer</h3><p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p></html>
