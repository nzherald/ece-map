</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>E Tipu e Rea Early Learning Centre is an education and care service. It is licensed for full day care for 40 children aged birth to five years.</p><p>The centre states that it is committed to providing low cost quality care for the wide range of children and families within the local community. A feature of this centre is the strong relationships that have been built with parents, with the Māori and Pacific communities, and the wider Aranui community.</p><p>The centre is effectively run by a board of trustees. Trustees have developed very good working relationships with the centre manager and staff.</p><p>The centre’s building developments have been delayed because of decisions yet to be made about the Aranui Learning Cluster. In the meantime, trustees and staff have successfully maintained the environment and resources that support the high-quality programme the centre offers to children and their families.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from a strong centre focus on building learning partnerships among children, their parents and teachers. Parents are expected to be involved. They are given very good opportunities to participate in the programme and to extend this to home learning. Teachers have warm, respectful and affirmating relationships with children that are very effective in supporting children’s learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Teachers have developed a shared approach to guiding children’s learning. They aim to empower children to lead their own learning, and to be creative and inquiring. Teachers use their interactions with children to promote children’s thinking, problem solving, and to make decisions about their future learning. The centre manager emphasises the need for all teachers to be consistent in this approach.</p><p>The centre’s programme is based on the interests and needs of individual children. Children make a significant contribution to the planning of the centre programme. They regularly meet with a teacher to talk about the programme and make suggestions about what could be included next. Teachers appropriately respond to children’s suggestions and ideas. Resources made by children and wall displays reflect children’s learning across a wide range of interests and topics. The programme is enriched by significant input from parents, and by people and resources within the community.</p><p>Other strengths of the programme in the nursery and over two year old programmes include:</p><ul>
<li>a system of primary care in the nursery that supports children to settle and be secure, and to successfully transition to the preschool</li>
<li>a good range of opportunities for children to improve their literacy and numeracy understandings and skills</li>
<li>the centre’s approach to healthy food and eating habits that support both children and parents</li>
<li>the centre environment which gives children good access to a wide range of activities and resources, indoors and outdoors</li>
<li>children’s transition to school which is very well supported by good relationships that exist between the centre and schools.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have very good shared knowledge and understanding of children’s learning and progress. This is updated at regular meetings that review the development of all aspects of children’s learning and wellbeing. Outcomes are effectively used to extend children’s learning.</p><p>Teachers are well supported by professional development. Their appraisal helps them to develop and extend the use of effective teaching practices. Teachers set appraisal goals that include performance targets set out by the board. They also set personal goals for their future development and receive feedback on progress towards meeting them. Teacher appraisal contributes well to centre review.</p><p>Whanaungatanga is a strong focus in this centre. Families from all cultures are affirmed and well included. Many aspects of tikanga Māori are celebrated, and te reo Māori is well used by teachers. Celebrations appropriate for Pacific families are also included in children’s programmes.</p><p>Māori and Pacific parents are able to talk to teachers about expectations they have for their children. Teachers use this information to further support their children.</p><p>The centre manager implements a shared leadership model that allows all teachers to use their strengths for the benefit of children. Parents can show leadership in the centre through being members of the board, and contributing their skills and interests in many aspects of the centre programme. Children have a strong voice in their own learning and assessment, and within the centre programme.</p><p>The board continues to have a strong and positive influence in supporting and guiding centre practices for the benefit of children. Trustees work closely with staff to make sure good relationships are maintained at all levels within the centre. Trustees set useful guidelines for the future direction of the centre through the development of performance targets and by good planning.</p><p>The centre has well established and effective processes for self review. There is good evidence that reviews have improved outcomes for children. Regular reviews focus on important parts of the curriculum and how learning and teaching can be improved. Teachers’ reflections on their own teaching are an important part of centre review. All parents are regularly surveyed and their responses are valued and used in the centre’s self review. The board has a full set of policies and procedures that are regularly reviewed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre’s philosophy statement does not reflect current practices for learning and teaching in the centre. Teachers have identified that they need to review and rewrite this statement so that it gives a better overview of the beliefs and practices that are central to guiding the centre’s good practices.</p><p>There is some variation in how well teachers record children’s learning in their learning stories. The next step is to make sure all teachers are able to identify the learning that occurs during activities, and to accurately record this so it gives clear direction for all teachers to evaluate progress in children’s learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of E Tipu e Rea Early Learning Centre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of E Tipu e Rea Early Learning Centre will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
