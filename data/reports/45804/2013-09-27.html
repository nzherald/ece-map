</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Blessings for Life is a new service providing full day care and education in a home-like environment for up to 20 children. The centre largely provides for children over two years old but also caters for a small group of infants and toddlers. The owner opened the centre in November 2011 with staff who are close family members and share Christian beliefs. As a result strong features of the service are the family atmosphere, a low key approach to routines and programmes underpinned by Christian values.</p><p>Staff have engaged in first aid training but have not yet established professional development programmes. Most of the staff are registered early childhood teachers who have a strong interest in the community and in establishing learning partnerships with families. Almost half the centre roll is Māori and teachers are committed to supporting these children to succeed as Māori.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of Blessings for Life.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre is a warm and welcoming environment for children and their families. Children settle happily, quickly make choices about play and activities of interest and interact confidently with adults. They are relaxed and engage enthusiastically with their friends. Children participate well in mat-time activities and planned project work. Infants and toddlers explore independently and receive affectionate care within the whole group.</p><p>Māori children are specifically supported through the use of waiata, karakia and some Māori-themed resources. They are also learning to recite their mihi. Teachers are developing their integration of te reo Māori in the programme.</p><p>Teachers support children's involvement in the programme well. They consistently work alongside children engaging them in conversations that encourage children to share their own ideas. Teachers expect children to develop as independent learners with respect for the environment and each other. Positive guidance, trusting relationships and affirming interactions characterise teachers’ work with children.</p><p>Teachers plan programmes in response to the interests of individual children and the group. They plan associated activities and resources to provide a variety of learning experiences. Teachers incorporate science learning well and make very good use of the outdoor environment and community resources. They thoughtfully evaluate the effects of their programmes and record children's learning in attractive assessment portfolios.</p><p>Teachers are keen to support children's transition to school and provide some specific early literacy and numeracy tasks as part of this commitment. It is important that the emphasis is on children learning literacy and numeracy in more playful contexts rather than in formal literacy activities. As they continue to develop the centre curriculum, teachers could increase their focus on children up to two years old. While these children are warmly nurtured, they would benefit from a deliberate emphasis on toddlers’ play and development in the programme plan.</p><p>Parents and families are welcomed partners in the centre. They are well informed about activities, invited to share information about their children and encouraged to be involved in their child’s learning. The owner and teachers respect and value the diversity of their community and are responsive to different family needs. They are developing strategies to further involve families in planning and self-review processes.</p><p>The owner has made good progress in establishing centre management and administration systems. The family nature of the business has resulted in suitable low key practices that are supported by an appropriate range of policies and procedures. The owner has developed a long-term strategic plan that informs her annual planning. She recognises she could now strengthen this framework to align better with early childhood regulations. The establishment of professional development programmes for all staff would enhance these strategies for improvement. In keeping with the early stage of the centre’s development, documentation of self review is just beginning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre owner and ERO agree that the next steps for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening planning and assessment to more clearly identify teachers’ roles in extending children's learning</li>
<li>developing goals to further promote the success of Māori children, including increasing the use of te reo Māori in the programme</li>
<li>promptly implementing personnel policies, including the staff appraisal process</li>
<li>becoming more rigorous in the documentation of self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Blessings for Life completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practices the owner should review practices related to centre excursions to clarify strategies for risk management and to improve adult to child ratios for beach trips.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Blessings for Life will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>27 September 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
