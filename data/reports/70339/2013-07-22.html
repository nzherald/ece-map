</table><p>The Champion Centre Tamariki Toiora is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Champion Centre Tamariki Toiora is an early intervention service for infants and young children with complex developmental challenges. The service is administered by a charitable trust. All children attend with a parent/caregiver on a regular day, once a week or fortnight. Children are involved in sessions of intensive individual and small group work with specialist teaching and a therapy team.</p><p>The director and staff have continued to build on the good practices identified in the 2009 ERO report.</p><p>The programmes for children are based on the service’s philosophy that all learning occurs within the day-to-day experiences of the children and with those that care for them. All staff are strongly committed to the philosophy and this is evident in their practice. The staff include highly skilled teachers, specialists, therapists, support workers and social workers. All staff members have long experience working in this field.</p><p>Staff collaborate with parents to develop individual plans that identify their children’s priorities for development. They model and discuss with parents, useful activities that will effectively support individual children’s learning and development. Parents/whānau are well supported to continue specific programmes in their homes and other settings away from the early intervention centre.</p><p>The trustees and director are continuing to build on the skills and strengths of the staff in order to sustain the high quality education and care provided for children in the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn in a caring and positive environment. They are well supported in their learning and are appropriately extended through play-based activities. They enjoy the learning activities with the staff and their parents and have good opportunities to take the lead with their learning.</p><p>The service has a well-established culture in which children, parents and staff are valued, celebrated and affirmed. Each family/whānau is considered an essential part of the centre’s learning community. Parents’ knowledge of their children is sensitively used to help plan appropriate activities. The service leaders and staff know parents’ aspirations and work collaboratively with them to achieve these.</p><p>Programme planning is well linked to the strands of <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum. Staff show a good understanding of appropriate use of tikanga Māori. They have good access to the cultural support and advice of Māori advisers to the service. They seek support from the Ministry of Education’s Pacific support staff when necessary. Staff develop positive, trusting relationships with families that enable the sharing of useful information to support a child’s learning.</p><p>Assessment information is effectively used to guide the planning of children’s individualised programmes. Education staff support children on specific intervention programmes when they are in their local early childhood setting. Children’s transition to school is well planned and managed by key staff.</p><p>Staff are well supported by the director and board in their professional development. They are reflective practitioners who regularly evaluate their teaching practices and the impact of these on children. Many of their programmes are based on knowledge gained or supported by current research. The research currently undertaken by the director has directly contributed to the service’s early intervention programmes.</p><p>The service’s strategic plan clearly identifies the service’s priorities and objectives and how they are to be achieved. Its policies and job descriptions appropriately guide and lead to consistent practice in all aspects of the service. Performance appraisal processes are comprehensive and effectively help maintain high quality performance and focus on continual improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>Staff are highly reflective about the quality of their practices and the impact of their work with children. The next step is for the centre director and staff to extend self review by:</p><ul>
<li>taking a more systematic approach to evaluating the progress made towards achieving some key objectives for the organisation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Champion Centre Tamariki Toiora completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Champion Centre Tamariki Toiora will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>22 July 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
