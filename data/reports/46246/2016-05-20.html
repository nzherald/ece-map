</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Amanda's in the Bay home-based early childhood service is a satellite of the well-established Amanda's Homebased ECE service in Auckland. In-home childcare is offered by educators who work in their own homes. One educator can be responsible for up to four children at any one time. This service is licensed for 50 children, with 22 currently enrolled. Eighteen children identify as Māori.</p><p>The Education Team Leader (ETL) is a registered teacher who provides support and guidance for six educators currently in this network. Governance is provided through the Auckland-based service. This is the first review of this network.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate in an individualised programme that is responsive to their interests. They learn with and alongside their peers. Educators support children's interests by providing a range of activities.</p><p>Educators take a deliberate approach to settling and building relationships, particularly with infants. The small group size, in the home context supports infants' and toddlers' need for strong and secure attachments.</p><p>Parents are informed about the programme through newsletters. They are invited to contribute their ideas about aspects of the curriculum.</p><p>The ETL makes regular home visits to educators and children to coach educators to develop their practice in providing a responsive learning programme for each child. Supporting children's developing social competence is a particular strength of this network.</p><p>The bicultural programme is not strongly evident. There is a need to increase the reflection of te ao Māori through service-wide documentation and be implemented in practice.</p><p>Regular playgroups extend the home-based programme. There have been recent positive changes to the planning process. These documents show a shared focus for the programme and draw links to <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. The ETL has identified a next step is to develop closer links between the playgroup plan and the programme in homes. ERO agrees with this direction.</p><p>Assessing children's learning is a collaborative process between the ETL and the educator. The 'Waka Huia' books are a reflection of the child's individual programme. These show children engaging in a range of learning activities and developing friendships with others. It is timely to review the procedure guiding the process of assessment. Consideration should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>focusing on enhancing dispositional as well as skill-based learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing the complexity of children's learning over time to clearly identify the difference the in-home programme is making for the learner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reflecting children's culture, language and identity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The ELT is supported in her role through networking with others in a similar role. This provides opportunities to share current practice and engage in ongoing learning.</p><p>Some policy review has occurred in response to ERO's findings in the 2015 reviews of the Auckland networks. Re-establishing the regular cycle of policy review is essential. Priorities for review include policies that relate to assessment, planning and evaluation, self review and bicultural practice. The child protection policy should also be reviewed to reflect the requirements of the <em>Vulnerable Children’s Act 2014</em>.</p><p>The owner recognises the need to develop a strategic plan that sets a clear, time-bound direction for the service. Initial work has begun on this process. Consideration should be given to how educational success for Māori can be promoted through the service's strategic intent.</p><p>A recently established framework has been introduced to guide the self-review process. Building an understanding of effective evaluation in order to measure the impact of the changes on improved outcomes for children, parents and whānau is a key next step.</p><p>Useful systems have been implemented to effectively monitor the health and safety requirements expected of the service. Educators thoughtfully provide a range of opportunities for the child to be physically active throughout the day and healthy eating is actively promoted.</p><p>Since ERO's onsite phase the owner has provided ERO with an action plan. This shows how she will address the priorities for improvement in relation to governance and management outlined in the report. ERO will monitor progress against the plan.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The service provider and the ETL agree that key next steps for improving the service include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>documentation that clearly reflects the service's commitment to bicultural practice and shows how children's cultures, languages and identities are celebrated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation to support the provision of a high quality curriculum that shows how complexity is added to children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review of policies, to align them with current high quality practice and to ensure they meet legislative requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strategic planning that sets a clear and timely direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consideration of how educational success for Māori can be promoted.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Amanda's in the Bay completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><p>• curriculum</p><p>• premises and facilities</p><p>• health and safety practices</p><p>• governance, management and administration.</p><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice the owner should:</p><p>review policies and procedures to make sure they meet all the requirements of the Vulnerable Children's Act (2014).</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Amanda's in the Bay will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>20 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><p>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</p><p>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</p><p>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</p><p>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
