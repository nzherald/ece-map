</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Blockhouse Bay Christian Kindergarten is a well established centre, located in the grounds of the Blockhouse Bay Community Church. It provides sessional and full day education and care for children over two years. The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. Families in the centre are from a variety of cultural and ethnic groups. The centre has effective management practices and there is very good partnership with parents/whānau.</p><p>The centre is well staffed with a manager, fully registered teachers and one administrator. There is a high adult to child ratio. Since the 2011 ERO review the indoor environment has been refurbished and the outdoors upgraded. The centre manager and teachers have strengthened self review and developed improved strategies for extending children’s interests. Good community relationships continue to be a strength. The centre offers parenting courses for families and helps them to access social support services when needed. Sessions are now available for two and a half year old children and, at the time of this 2014 review, there was one child under three years of age enrolled.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre’s philosophy underpins the high quality, child led programme. The curriculum reflects the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum and well integrated Christian values. Teachers have a genuine commitment to being inclusive and to developing a more bicultural curriculum. Teachers affirm and build on the children’s strengths. Attractively presented assessment and planning documents shows how children’s group and individual interests shape the programme. Children’s portfolios are highly valued and show the development of children’s interests and learning.</p><p>Teachers have high expectations, interact skilfully and sustain conversations with children. This contributes to children being confident, capable learners. Children have good opportunities to experience meaningful literacy, numeracy, and science activities. Children play cooperatively, have leadership opportunities and show empathy for others. Teachers successfully foster children’s social competence and their communication and problem solving skills. Children have fun as they make discoveries and learn through purposeful play.</p><p>Respectful and trusting relationships between teachers and families contribute to the sense of community in the centre. Teachers are culturally responsive. They celebrate children’s cultural diversity, use home languages and affirm children’s cultural identities. Teachers actively encourage parent and whānau partnership in children’s learning and development. Parents/ whānau are kept well informed and are encouraged to share their knowledge and ideas. The centre has strong connections with the local community and schools. Children’s transition into the centre and on to school is well supported.</p><p>Children learn in a vibrant well resourced learning environment. This supports their sustained engagement in play. Children have very good opportunities to explore and be physically active in the spacious outdoor area. They engage in complex imaginative play and are able to be creative through an extensive variety of art, dance, and music activities. They are capable, confident learners.</p><p>Self review is robust, child focused, and used as a basis for improvements. Clear strategic goals, aligned to the centre vision statement and centre philosophy, are clearly outlined in annual plans. Rigorous performance management promotes high quality teaching practices and leadership opportunities.</p><p>Strong professional leadership enables the centre to maintain its focus on providing high quality early childhood education and care. Positive working relationships, mentoring and collaboration between management and staff help create a culture of trust and respect. The centre is governed effectively by a management committee that includes parents, church representatives and some centre personnel. There is effective record keeping, professional discussion and a comprehensive framework of policies and procedures.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers identified some areas for ongoing development. These include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen self review to maintain high quality teaching practices</li>
<li>enhance the centre's bicultural curriculum.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Blockhouse Bay Christian Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Blockhouse Bay Christian Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>3 June 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
