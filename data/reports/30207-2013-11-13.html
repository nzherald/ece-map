</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Huntly Kidz Childcare Centre is located in Huntly and provides education and care for children from birth to school age. It is licensed for 46 children, including a maximum of 16 up to two years of age. The current roll of 53 includes 37 Māori children, most of whom have whakapapa links to Tainui. This is the first ERO report for the centre since it was purchased by the current owner/directors in March 2013.</p><p>The centre responded positively to the November 2010 ERO report by making improvements to the physical environment and the learning programme. Major initiatives since 2011 have included:</p><ul>
<li>whānau (mixed age) grouping, which allows children to play and eat with family members and children of different ages</li>
<li>ongoing professional development to strengthen te reo Māori and bicultural practices.</li>
</ul><p>Managers are very responsive to the needs of tamariki, whānau and the local community. By providing transport to and from the centre, they have significantly increased opportunities for local children to receive early childhood education. The centre also provides nutritious cooked meals for tamariki.</p><p>The centre’s motto is ‘Ko ngā tamariki o ēnei rā hei rangatira mo āpōpō. The children of today are our leaders of tomorrow’. Its philosophy is to provide a welcoming and inclusive, bicultural environment for tamariki, whānau, staff, hapu/iwi and the local community. Teachers are keen to work with whānau to provide the best learning outcomes for their tamariki. They believe in building loving and trusting relationships with all tamariki, nurturing their emotional, physical and spiritual wellbeing, and empowering them to become capable and competent learners.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A very knowledgeable and experienced centre manager (appointed in May 2011) provides sound professional leadership. She has high expectations for teaching and learning. The centre manager and teachers have established a collaborative culture in which teachers’ strengths are valued. Effective mentoring and self-review practices have resulted in significant improvements to teaching practice.</p><p>The programme strongly reflects the centre’s philosophy and teachers’ understanding of bicultural practices and the principles of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki</em>. Strengths of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>te reo, tikanga and te ao Māori, and a strong emphasis on whanaungatanga (family relationships) underpins all aspects of teaching and learning</li>
</ul><p>Māori children experiencing success in an environment that enhances their identity and strongly affirms Māori values and experiences</p><p>children having rich and meaningful opportunities to learn about literacy, mathematics, science, caring for the environment, the creative arts, Tainui heritage and the local community</p><p>interactions between tuakana and teina (older and younger children) and group activities, such as karakia, kapa haka, mihimihi (greeting speeches) and mat-times, provide frequent opportunities for children to take leadership roles.</p><p>Teachers establish positive, caring and trusting relationships with children and make very effective use of whānau relationships to settle children. They notice children’s interests, engage in learning conversations, and positively affirm children’s efforts and contributions.</p><p>Children learn to be confident, capable learners and communicators. Older children and toddlers demonstrate well-developed self-care skills, and have good opportunities to develop social skills and to make friends. Children explore areas of interest to them and frequently revisit and reflect on their previous learning. Teachers’ interactions with young babies are particularly nurturing and responsive. Teachers work closely with whānau to identify and respond to babies’ individual care needs and routines.</p><p>Teachers keep whānau well informed about their children’s learning through informal conversations, portfolios and wall displays. They make good use of information shared by whānau to cater for individual children’s needs and interests.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre directors and managers agree that the next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>define governance and management roles and responsibilities</li>
<li>develop a meaningful strategic plan, informed by self review, that includes clear priorities for improving the quality of education</li>
<li>allocate sufficient resources for the ongoing operation of the service and planned improvements</li>
<li>review positive guidance policies and practices</li>
<li>strengthen curriculum self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation </h3><p>ERO recommends that centre directors access suitable external support to implement the next steps identified in this report.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Huntly Kidz Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>The directors are in the process of addressing potential earthquake hazards and re-establishing the outside grass area.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Huntly Kidz Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>13 November 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
