<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Westmere Kindergarten is well placed to continue promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Westmere Kindergarten is a well established centre operating in the Auckland suburb of Westmere. The kindergarten caters for children aged from two to five years in age-related groupings.</p><p>The community is predominantly NZ European/P&#257;keh&#257; with some M&#257;ori, Pacific and Indian families. The community is very supportive of the kindergarten, organising and managing fundraising and social family events.</p><p>The kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA). The Association provides policy, procedural and operating guidelines. It also provides teachers with regular professional development and ongoing support from professional support managers.</p><p>A recent change of head teacher has encouraged the teaching team of three to review the philosophy and to build teamwork.</p><p>The kindergarten has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The programme that teachers provide for children supports their independence and prompts them to explore and deepen their learning. Teachers involve themselves in children&rsquo;s play and respond positively to the directions that children take in their learning. Children concentrate and remain involved for long periods.</p><p>Relationships between children and teachers are cheerful and positive. Children play cooperatively in groups and show great interest in creative and imaginative games. They are articulate and eager to share their thinking with teachers and other children. Teachers provide opportunities for children to share news and be involved in decision making.</p><p>Well considered, shared changes are having a positive impact on teachers&rsquo; enthusiasm and positive outcomes for children. Teachers are aware of the need to continue this forward progress. Whole-centre professional development to refine assessment practices is booked for the near future.</p><p>An additional aim is for teachers to continue to build on their good, informal relationships with families, particularly M&#257;ori families. New ways of recording the information that parents share about their children is encouraging parents to contribute more. Teachers intend to extend these opportunities to learn more about parents&rsquo; aspirations for their children.</p><p>Teachers engage children in learning well. They help children to research ideas that interest them. Children respond to opportunities for making choices about the programme and for voting on decisions that involve their learning. Teachers intend to continue involving children in planning their own learning.</p><p>The head teacher has a clear understanding of next steps the team should take. Teachers value her leadership and are sharing leadership of different aspects of the kindergarten operations. They have established good frameworks for programme planning, self review and management of the kindergarten.</p><p>The kindergarten environment is attractive and well organised. Teachers consider the environment as an important aspect of teaching and have spent time organising playing spaces to create opportunities for children to take part in activities. Children make choices from a wide range of high quality resources and materials provided in ways that engage their interest.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop a teaching and learning philosophy to provide consistency and standardise practices</li>
<li>strengthen portfolios as a tool for linking assessment and planning</li>
<li>continue to deepen self review to identify areas for improvement.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Westmere Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.Click here to enter text.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h4>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h4><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>24 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
