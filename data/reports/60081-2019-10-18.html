</table><p>Discovery Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Discovery Early Learning Centre is a privately-owned service in Kelson, Lower Hutt. The centre is licensed to provide full-time education and care for 36 children aged from two years to school age. The centre is governed by the Discovery Christian Centre Trust and operates in a purpose-built complex, alongside other community services the trust provides.</p><p>Since ERO's November 2016 report, a new head teacher and assistant head teacher have been appointed. A general manager manages the day-to-day operations as well as supporting the teaching team. Most teachers are qualified.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy emphasises the uniqueness of every child who is a precious gift with God-given strengths. 'Through loving relationships, we nurture the growth of each child’s spirit, body, and mind - taha wairua, taha tinana, taha hinengaro.'</p><p>The 2016 ERO report identified areas requiring further improvement. These included strengthening aspects of review and evaluation, assessment and planning, Māori success as Māori, aspects of the appraisal system, and clarifying roles and responsibilities. Progress is ongoing to address some of these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play, learn and have fun in a calm and unhurried free-play programme. They are encouraged to explore and work independently and to create and learn with their peers. Teachers work alongside them, using a range of strategies to support and extend their interests. Oral language and mathematics concepts are promoted. Positive, respectful interactions are highly evident.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy was developed collaboratively by leaders, teachers, parents, whānau and children to determine what learning matters here and to define educational success. It is timely for the centre to review the philosophy to ensure it reflects current parent, family and whānau aspirations for their children.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported through an inclusive programme. The centre works with external agencies as appropriate.</p><p>Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are valued and celebrated in the centre. Purposeful kaupapa Māori rituals and resources support the programme. Excursions to the local awa enrich children’s learning. Leaders and teachers should explore how they can better promote places of value for Māori in the curriculum. This should further enhance children’s understanding of te ao Māori. Teachers should encourage greater use of te reo Māori in every day conversations with children.</p><p>Purposeful group and individual planning are based on teacher-led and child-initiated interests. Teachers recognise what is important for learning through using <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, to develop specific learning goals and meaningful learning experiences. An online assessment tool provides opportunities for parents and whānau to contribute to their children's learning stories. Leaders should consider how to better develop purposeful partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>Children’s taonga books provide a record of their developing friendships, learning and participation in a wide range of rich learning experiences. Teachers should enhance assessment documentation to show:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>explicit intentional teaching strategies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how children’s culture, language and identity are celebrated</p>
</li>
<li>how children, their parents and whānau are supported through well-considered transition processes to school.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders are improvement focused. They use internal evaluation to reflect on and improve the curriculum. A next step is to build teachers' knowledge and understanding of internal evaluation so that they can more effectively measure the impact of their practices on children’s learning.</p><p>A clear strategic plan guides the centre direction. Well-defined roles and responsibilities are in place. Leaders and teachers are highly committed to the philosophy, vision and goals of the centre.</p><p>The centre has an appropriate appraisal framework to support and grow teacher capability. Purposeful goals focus on building teacher practice and leadership. Observations are used to identify good practice and inform next steps.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that the next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review the philosophy to ensure it reflect parent, family and whānau aspirations for their children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promote places of value for Māori in the curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop learning partnerships with parents and whānau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance aspects of assessment and planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build teachers' evaluation capabilities.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Discovery Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Paterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>18 October 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
