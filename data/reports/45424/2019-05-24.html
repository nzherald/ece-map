</table><p>Henwood Kindy is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Henwood Kindy is located in a semi-rural area near New Plymouth. It is privately owned and managed.</p><p>The service is licensed to provide education and care from Monday to Friday, for 56 children over two years of age. Of the 81 children enrolled, seven are Māori.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises the living world, people, places and things and includes te ao Māori values of manaakitanga, aroha, whanaungatanga and imaginative play. Kaitiakitanga practices and the nurturing of animals and gardens are central to the learning culture of the service.</p><p>The June 2015 ERO report identified areas requiring further development. The focus areas were to strengthen systems and sustain good practice in: collaborative review; refining of the philosophy; strategic priorities; the teacher appraisal process; and ongoing self review. Progress is evident.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children, through self-directed play are highly engaged in experiences rich in literacy, mathematics, science, arts and the natural environment. They show independence and confidence when negotiating the environment as explorers, investigators and creative learners.</p><p>The curriculum design carefully weaves in <em>Te Whāriki</em>. It deliberately responds to children's strengths, preferences and needs and includes parent aspirations. Families input informs a sound foundation for planning for individual children.</p><p>There are clear guidelines for documenting assessment and planning of children's learning journeys. Teachers are intentional in their practice. Leaders should continue to strengthen consistency in implementing shared expectations of documented assessment, learning processes and practices.</p><p>Teachers promote Te Tiriti-based practices through culturally responsive practices that affirm children's cultures, languages and identities. Te ao Māori concepts and practices are culturally respectful and responsive. Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are authentically integrated into the programme though tikanga rituals, artefacts, arts, literature and symbols. Professional learning focused on localised curriculum should further build knowledge and understanding of Taranaki Māori narratives.</p><p>Transitions within the centre are flexible to meet the needs of individual children and families. Deliberate strategies to ensure smooth changeovers to schools are well considered. A number of children stay on at the service past five years of age. Children’s additional needs are well known and supported.</p><p>A distributed team approach to leadership is in place. Collective inquiry and review is actively implemented and explores what teachers are doing to encourage children's learning. Review for accountability and improvement is well understood and informs decision-making. Leaders should further strengthen to clearly identify the impact and effectiveness of their teaching on outcomes for children.</p><p>The revised appraisal process includes an external appraiser and mentor. This increased focus should further build teachers' capability and assist in meeting the Teaching Council requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and leaders agree that leaders and teachers should continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>full implementation of the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>capability to use internal evaluation effectively to sustain and continually improve teaching and learning for all children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the quality and consistency of teachers' planning to identify what strategies are making the most difference for learners and why.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Henwood Kindy completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phillip Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>24 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
