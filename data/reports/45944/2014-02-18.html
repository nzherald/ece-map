<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Educarents Queenstown is a new home-based and nanny service in the Queenstown Lakes District. It is one of four franchises in the Educarents Management Limited group. The licensee is carefully establishing very good systems and practices to provide care and education for children aged from birth to five years.</p><p>In this service the nannies and caregivers are referred to as educarers.</p><p>Key strengths of this service are:</p><ul>
<li>strong relationships educarers have with the children and their families</li>
<li>effective support educarers receive from the coordinator</li>
<li>the regular professional learning and development (PLD) provided for educarers, parents and the wider community</li>
<li>the policy and operations framework provided by Educarents Management Limited</li>
<li>the licensee&rsquo;s commitment to continuous improvement to ensure high-quality learning outcomes for the children.</li>
</ul><p>As the service grows, the licensee needs to review the philosophy to show more clearly the learning priorities for children and to ensure policies and procedures are consistently followed by all educarers.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Educarents Queenstown is a new home-based care and nanny service in the Queenstown Lakes District. It is one of four franchises within Educarents Management Limited.</p><p>The owner operator/licensee is a registered early childhood teacher and is the coordinator for the service. She has developed a local philosophy that has a strong educational focus. She provides ongoing support for the 12 educarers.</p><p>Educarents Management Limited places high importance on:</p><ul>
<li>treating children with respect and dignity</li>
<li>developing and maintaining strong relationships between families, educarers and the wider community</li>
<li>frequent personal and professional learning for parents and educarers.</li>
</ul><p>At the time of the review there were 47 children enrolled in the service. ERO visited a sample of three homes.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><p>Educarers have warm and supportive relationships with children and their families. They know the children well, including children&rsquo;s individual routines. They follow the children&rsquo;s interests in meaningful ways.</p><p>Children benefit from the high expectations the coordinator has for their learning. The coordinator encourages the educarers to provide a wide range of learning experiences. Children enjoy regular outings into the community and may attend a monthly Educarents' playgroup. The coordinator effectively supports the educarers by:</p><ul>
<li>being in frequent contact with them to answer any questions and queries</li>
<li>giving them useful information to help them recognise and extend children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>providing appropriate resources and systems to help support children&rsquo;s growth and development, and to ensure all requirements are met.</li>
</ul><p>Educarers and the coordinator use ICT well to give parents immediate information about their child&rsquo;s learning and daily activities. Parents and educarers appreciate and value the close daily communications the home settings allow.</p><p>Ongoing PLD is a priority for all adults in the Educarents&rsquo; community. Key features of this PLD are that:</p><ul>
<li>it is made available to parents, educarers and wider community</li>
<li>it covers a range of topics relevant to children&rsquo;s learning and development</li>
<li>educarers are implementing ideas gained from PLD and becoming more confident in their roles.</li>
</ul><p>The coordinator has been strategic in establishing a very good-quality service. She is well supported by the franchisor. There is clear alignment between strategic and annual planning and with self review. The coordinator is very reflective of her practices. She uses robust self-review practices to know what is going well and where improvements are required.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>ERO, the licensee and the franchisor of Educarents Management Limited agree the following are the important next steps to enhance the good practices noted by ERO.</p><p>The licensee needs to review the philosophy, and teaching and learning statement to give a greater emphasis on the M&#257;ori dimension and learning priorities for children. This should help ensure these are included in strategic and annual planning, and are the basis for self review.</p><p>The licensee must also ensure systems and expectations are consistently followed by all educarers.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Educarents Queenstown completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>18 February 2014</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>
