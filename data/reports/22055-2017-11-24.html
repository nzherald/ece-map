</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waiheke Island Playcentre is a well-established family cooperative in the semi-rural community of Waiheke. The centre is licensed for 30 children, including up to 15 under two years of age, and is open for four sessions each week.</p><p>Centre practices are based on Playcentre's philosophy of families learning together. The philosophy affirms parents as valued and best educators of their children. Sessions are guided by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. There is an expectation that during sessions te reo Māori will be used.</p><p>The centre is one of 21 in the North Shore Playcentre Association. The Association provides a management and policy framework, and centre support personnel. Playcentre Aotearoa is in the process of a national restructure and the North Shore Association is now part of Playcentre's northern region. A new regional manager has been appointed and support personnel roles and expectations are being confirmed.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO report centre members have sustained good practices and continued to enrich learning opportunities for children. They have strengthened planning and evaluation processes and worked to improve the documentation of self-review. Centre members have improved the learning environments to make spaces safer and more inviting. While there have been membership changes, most members are currently enrolled in Playcentre training courses.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the North Shore Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre members provide a play based programme that enacts Playcentre philosophy and <em>Te Whāriki</em>. Bicultural practices and a deep respect for te ao Māori are woven through the programme. A focus on environmental sustainability is another characteristic of the centre.</p><p>Parents/whānau value child-initiated play and are aware of children's strengths, interests and dispositions. The programme is highly responsive to children’s learning and development, and provides very well for the mixed-age group attending.</p><p>There is a strong sense of whanaungatanga in the centre. Responsive, respectful relationships between children, parents/whānau and the local community contribute positively to children’s emotional wellbeing and sense of belonging. Centre members affirm and share the strengths that children and their whānau bring. Children show trust, kindness and empathy towards adults and other children.</p><p>Children are confident, capable learners and they play cooperatively. Older children often lead group activities and include younger children. They have fun and use literacy, mathematics and science in meaningful contexts. Children engage in a wide range of learning experiences. The very well-resourced environment promotes investigation, innovation and hands-on learning.</p><p>Parents/whānau enrich children's conversation and language development as they affirm and build on children's ideas and strengths. They sensitively support and enrich children's play with affirmation, suggestions and additional resources. Adults ensure that the youngest children are also well provided for at the centre. They encourage toddlers to explore, make choices and try out new activities. Infants are confident and relaxed and actively engage in the programme.</p><p>The spacious outdoor area provides good opportunities for children to experience physical challenge, engage in imaginative play, and learn about the natural world. Children join in sustained, purposeful play and have a positive attitude to learning.</p><p>Highly effective systems for assessment, planning and evaluation record how adults notice, recognise and respond to children's learning. Session evaluations contribute to planning, and support continuity of learning. Children’s individual assessment portfolios are highly valued as taonga that clearly show each child's learning journey. Multiple parents/whānau contribute to individual children's portfolios. These are used by children and adults to revisit past learning experiences.</p><p>The Association management team has a strong commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and to maintaining a bicultural partnership with Māori whānau. This commitment is evident in Association operations and in centre support. Centres can access funding to help them build confidence with bicultural practices. Whānau Māori are invited to join Roopu Mahi Ngātahi o Puāwai. The natural inclusion of te reo and tikanga Māori are an integral part of Waiheke practices that affirm Māori children’s cultural identity.</p><p>Families' multicultural backgrounds are valued and celebrated. Pacific children and families are also well supported through the inclusion of aspects of their cultures and languages.</p><p>Centre members' enthusiasm for, and involvement in, Playcentre training reflects their commitment to taking an active role in their children’s education and centre operations. Sound leadership and shared high expectations support newer members to understand Playcentre philosophy, and how to support child initiated play<em>.</em></p><p>Internal evaluation contributes to ongoing sustainability and is helping to guide improvements. Centre members take a strategic, professional and collaborative approach to maintaining a high standard of education and care for children.</p><p>The Association currently has effective governance and management practices. A voluntary executive committee takes responsibility for specific management and centre support tasks. Good systems help them to monitor the quality of programmes, adult education levels, and health and safety requirements. The management team provides professional leadership to help centres respond to changes, particularly as they transition to the new national and regional structure.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members have identified appropriate key next steps, including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>exploring further ways to record child-led planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting newer members in leadership roles and Playcentre education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepening their understanding and use of internal evaluation to guide and improve practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waiheke Island Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waiheke Island Playcentre will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>24 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
