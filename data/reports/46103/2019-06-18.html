</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>New Shoots Children's Centre - Hamilton Central provides full-day education and care for children from infants to school age. It is located in central Hamilton. The centre operates five aged-based rooms with shared outdoor spaces. It is licensed for 97 children including 36 under the age of two years. The current roll of 92 children includes 18 who identify as Māori and 28 from a wide range of other nationalities. The diversity of teachers' cultural backgrounds reflects that of children and families in the centre.</p><p>Through their vision and philosophy New Shoots teachers aim to develop relationships based on integrity, respect, nurture and trust. They state that relationships underpin all learning between children, their whānau and teachers.</p><p>The centre is governed by the New Shoots Children's Centre group. The three group owners provide an overarching governance and management framework. The Hamilton centre director is supported by an assistant manager, team leaders and room leaders in each room. The teaching team consists of qualified, in-training and unqualified teachers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are empowered to make independent decisions about their learning. They are viewed as competent and confident learners. Teachers are highly responsive to the needs of children. Positive, reciprocal interactions support a strong sense of belonging amongst learners. Social competencies are well supported through the consistent use of positive guidance practices. Children with additional learning needs are fully involved in the learning environment through inclusive teaching practices.</p><p>Children benefit from attractive and well-presented environments. Children up to the age of two years benefit from individualised routines and form secure attachments with familiar caring adults. Transitions into the centre and between the age-based rooms are well supported. Bicultural teaching practices continue to grow and develop. Teachers actively seek knowledge from families about their language, culture, identities and aspirations for their children. This supports children to develop a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging at the centre.</p><p>A rich and broad curriculum is promoting positive learning outcomes for children. The provision of a wide range of activities and effective use of the natural environment encourages children to add complexity to their learning. Risk taking and challenge are well promoted with regular excursions investigating the natural world for older learners. Māori children benefit from the integration of te ao Māori into the programme including the use of waiata, karakia and whakatau to welcome guests and visitors. Literacy, mathematics, music and science are naturally woven throughout the programme. Community involvement enriches the programme with ongoing participation of a local aged care group and excursions to the city library. Children are engaged and settled in their learning.</p><p>Children's learning is captured in well-presented learning journals which are also available digitally. Teachers plan for groups of children who have similar identified curriculum learning goals. Further emphasis should now be placed on documenting the response to each child's aspirations and goals. Professional learning is planned to address these aspects of professional practise. Teachers use a wide range of effective strategies to engage children in meaningful play and to extend their learning.</p><p>Leaders base relationships on respect, trust and reciprocity. Emergent leadership amongst teachers is encouraged. There are opportunities for regular professional learning and development with ongoing mentoring and support for teachers. Leaders have developed clear guidelines and expectations for teaching practice and curriculum delivery.</p><p>A clear vision sets the direction for the service. It reflects a commitment to high-quality early childhood education for all children. The philosophy is well-embedded into practice. Current policy and systems are regularly reviewed. Management has identified the need to strengthen the appraisal system. They are currently working with external support to further develop this area. Internal evaluation is valued, effectively undertaken and leads to improved outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The appraisal process requires further development to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>show clear alignment with the Teaching Council Standards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>include clear expectations about the gathering of evidence to support the issuing and renewal of teachers' practicing certificates.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Planned developments of practices to support the assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning should also further build teacher capability in promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of New Shoots Children's Centre - Hamilton Central completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>18 June 2019</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
