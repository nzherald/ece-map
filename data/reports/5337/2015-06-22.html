<p>At this time Hutt City Kindergarten Association does not have the capacity to provide the level of targeted support necessary by this kindergarten.</p>
<p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Taita Kindergarten is located in Hutt City and provides education and care for children from two to five years of age. Morning sessions are offered each day and there is the option of an extended six-hour day. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 45 children and half of the roll identify as Māori.</p>
<p>The teaching team is fully qualified and the programme is further assisted by support staff. The September 2012 ERO report identified areas for ongoing development. These included: team work; assessment; planning and evaluation; the bicultural programme; the quality of interactions; and self review. Sufficient progress has not been made in many of these areas and they continue to be identified as key next steps in this report.</p>
<p>The kindergarten is governed by the Hutt City Kindergarten Association (the association). Two professional practice managers (PPMs) are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers. Since the previous review there have been several changes to the General Manager.</p>
<p>This review was part of a cluster of ten kindergartens reviews in the Hutt City Kindergarten Association.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children participate in a play-based programme. Their independence is promoted and they support one another in their play and learning. Music offers an extension to the programme and children actively participate. These shared experiences would be enhanced by the team working together to support both children and other staff. In addition, teachers should maximise the opportunities that arise to consistently support children’s developing social competence.</p>
<p>The association provides guidance and support to teachers for continuous improvement of teaching and learning. In this kindergarten it is not having the positive impact expected. Systems and processes are not leading to improvements to the quality of leadership, teaching and curriculum implementation. This kindergarten requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>a focused and strategic approach to building the capacity of the leadership</li>
<li>targeted reports and specific feedback from the PPM to show how effective the quality of teaching and learning is to improve outcomes for children</li>
<li>support to develop a shared understanding of the association’s expectations, particularly relating to the quality of teaching</li>
<li>the implementation of a robust appraisal process which has a development focus.</li>
</ul>
<p>In consultation with whānau, teachers should review the kindergarten philosophy to establish the shared values and beliefs. Indicators of quality practice should then be developed and used to guide and evaluate how well the kindergarten programme promotes positive learning outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Teachers provide a range of literacy experiences for children. It is timely for teachers to further develop their knowledge of current research and best practices that underpin a quality literacy programme in an early childhood context.</p>
<p>Regular narratives highlight children’s participation in the kindergarten programme. Teachers have identified that assessment, planning and evaluation requires further development. ERO agrees and identifies key next steps as:</p>
<ul>
<li>strengthening analysis to identify children’s learning</li>
<li>showing how teachers will add challenge and complexity to a child’s learning to better show progress over time</li>
<li>seeking and integrating parent aspirations, and reflecting and celebrate children’s culture, language and identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Group planning provides a shared direction in the programme. This should be improved through focused planning around a clearly stated learning goal. In addition, teachers should identify intentional teaching strategies and regularly evaluate the impact of the programme on children’s learning.</p>
<p>The bicultural programme is developing. Aspects of te reo me ngā tikānga Māori are evident particularly during routine times. Teachers should integrate the use of Māori culture and language throughout the curriculum. Success for Māori and Pacific families should be improved through consulting with them about the cultural aspirations they may have for their children.</p>
<p>Self review is not an established practice. Teachers need support to develop their understanding of the process of self review and their knowledge of evaluation.</p>
<p>At the time of this review the association was involved in a process of a formal review to determine the future direction of Hutt Kindergartens. ERO identified that, within the current operating model, the capacity of senior staff to provide targeted support that promotes ongoing improvement to teaching and learning is limited.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>ERO identified priorities for improvement. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>building leadership capacity and a collaborative team</li>
<li>reviewing the philosophy and developing clear indicators of high quality practice</li>
<li>consistently promoting children’s social competence and quality literacy practices</li>
<li>improving assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>integrating the use of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori and promoting success for Māori and Pacific children</li>
<li>developing an understanding of self review and evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The association should:</p>
<ul>
<li>strengthen the measures used to evaluate the progress of the strategic plan</li>
<li>provide evaluative reports to support decision making</li>
<li>at a strategic level, identify strategies to promote cultural responsiveness to Māori and Pacific families</li>
<li>monitor each kindergarten to ensure the robust implementation of the appraisal process.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Taita Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions for compliance</h3>
<p>ERO identified the following areas of non-compliance relating to the curriculum and self review. To meet requirements the kindergarten needs to improve its performance by:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>ensur</em>ing <em>the kindergarten curriculum supports children’s developing social competence and understanding of appropriate behaviour </em><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Service 2008,</em> C 10]</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>having an ongoing process of self review that helps the kindergarten to maintain and improve the quality of its education and care.<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6]</em></li>
</ul>
<p>To improve practice, the leader should:</p>
<ul>
<li>monitor the required documentation relating to health and safety and the authorisation for administering medication.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3>
<p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Taita Kindergarten will be within two years.</p>
<p>Joyce Gebbie</p>
<p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p>
<p>22 June 2015</p>
<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices/PART-4-ERO-s-Framework-for-review-Nga-Pou-Here"> Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p>
<h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul>
<p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
