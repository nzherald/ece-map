</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Aubrey Mason Kindergarten provides early childhood education for children two-to-five years of age. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 42 children. Children participate in half or whole-day learning programmes, running from 8.45am to 2.45pm. Children attending the kindergarten come from diverse cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The kindergarten's vision for all children is that they will develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the ability to confidently lead their own learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a sense of belonging through building positive connections with people and their local environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an awareness of, and pride in, their unique individual identity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Aubrey Mason is one of five kindergartens administered by the Ashburton Kindergarten Association (AKA). A manager oversees the association under the governance of a board. An education specialist is contracted to give professional advice and guidance on teaching and learning. The day-to-day operation of the kindergarten is managed by a head teacher, supported by three qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>Since the May 2014 ERO review the kindergarten has made good progress in responding to the areas identified for development, including increasing the visibility of Māori perspectives and children's cultural identities in assessment, and improving the documentation of self review.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five kindergartens reviewed in the AKA. The association is a member of the Hakatere Kāhui Ako|Community of Learning (CoL).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a rich and well-resourced learning programme and environment that promotes their engagement, exploration and developing competencies across the breadth of the curriculum. Opportunities to develop early literacy and numeracy skills and knowledge are meaningfully woven through the programme and environment.</p><p>Teaching practices and the learning programme very effectively support children to develop the positive outcomes identified in the kindergarten's vision for learners. Teachers use assessment practices well to get to know children's individual interests, strengths and learning needs. They value and draw on the knowledge and wisdom of parents and whānau to enhance their understanding of children as confident, capable and culturally diverse learners. They use this information to plan purposeful and authentic learning opportunities that extend children's thinking and learning.</p><p>New Zealand's indigenous Māori culture is celebrated and acknowledged throughout the programme and environment. All children hear te reo Māori being used as a living language and have Māori perspectives incorporated naturally alongside their everyday learning. Teachers take time to learn about the cultures and values of all children's families and find ways to reflect and value this in their learning.</p><p>Teachers have a deep understanding of the theories and approaches that underpin effective early childhood teaching. They are improvement focused and participate actively in ongoing professional learning. This professional knowledge is evident in the quality and intentionality of their interactions with children. Teachers are particularly mindful of the way they respect and nurture children's initiative and natural curiosity and model and encourage children's ability to enact the kindergarten's values of respect for self, others and the environment.</p><p>Children with additional needs are quickly identified and teachers work closely with families to develop appropriate learning goals and associated teaching strategies. When appropriate, teachers advocate strongly for children's access to specialist learning support.</p><p>The kindergarten is located across the road from Tinwald Primary School. Kindergarten children and new-entrant children in the school enjoy reciprocal visits and shared activities. Kindergarten and school teachers collaborate closely to support children's positive transition to school.</p><p>Effective leadership has ensured that the quality of teaching and learning has been well sustained over time. Leaders have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developed useful annual planning which keeps teaching staff focused on the vision and goals of the kindergarten and of the association</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maintained an unrelenting focus on positive outcomes for children and their families</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>led and modelled reflective practice and regular self review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>led and modelled highly respectful relationships with children and their families and with teachers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The Ashburton Kindergarten Association's vision and strategic goals are well known and reflected in individual kindergarten annual plans. The association has a sound policy and procedures framework in place to provide guidance for kindergarten operations and the monitoring of health and safety. The quality of teaching and learning in each kindergarten is regularly evaluated by the contracted education specialists. These evaluations are detailed and inform association planning and resourcing.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have access to relevant professional development and leadership support. The association actively supports equity of outcomes for children by funding additional teaching resource and a speech-language therapist to support work with children with additional needs. Some progress has been made in addressing the areas for development from ERO's 2014 review, including supporting a number of leaders and teachers to participate in professional learning about culturally responsive teaching practice. This continues to be an area of focus for the association, given the growing diversity of kindergarten rolls.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for teachers, with the support of the Education Support Manager (ESM) are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>extend the way teachers support children to lead their own learning by involving them more in assessing their progress and setting their learning goals</li>
<li>strengthen the collection and analysis of teaching and learning evidence in complex evaluations in order to more rigorously test the effectiveness of existing or changed practices.</li>
</ul><p>The association board, manager and ERO agree that aspects of governance can be improved by:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening planning for strategic and annual goals, including identifying relevant measures for knowing about the implementation and impact of goals</li>
<li>better aligning reporting from kindergartens and Kidsfirst education specialists with annual goals, in order to know about the implementation and impact of goals</li>
<li>improving monitoring of planning for, and outcomes for, priority learners across the association</li>
<li>building the internal evaluation capability of head teachers and teachers, particularly around the collection and analysis of evidence of practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Aubrey Mason Free Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Aubrey Mason Free Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>3 September 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
