<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Waitangirua Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is thelicensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support, advice and guidance to this teaching team, and for liaison with the kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten is situated in Porirua. Children attending come from twenty one cultural backgrounds, the majority of whom are M&#257;ori and Pacific. Children learn in an attractive, warm, welcoming environment in which their cultures are acknowledged, respected and celebrated. Cultural aides support children in their first language. Partnership with parents and wh&#257;nau is valued and contributes to the positive learning environment. Celebrating diversity, respecting and valuing difference underpins all that happens for children and staff.</p><p align="left">A highly positive and collaborative teaching team provides strong support and manaaki for children and their families. Warm, respectful relationships are evident between adults and children, and children and their peers. Relationships with local schools assist well-considered transitions for children and their wh&#257;nau.</p><p align="left">The programme promotes child-initiated learning. Children play cooperatively for sustained periods of time. They are confident and independent learners who accept and work through challenges. The concept of tuakana/teina is evident as children play and learn with each other. There is a focus on literacy, sustainable living and healthy life style. Te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori are evident within the environment and embedded in the programme.</p><p align="left">The children&rsquo;s ng&#257; pukapuka motuhake are treasured by all, include multiple teacher voices and provide a record of progress over time. Parents&rsquo; contributions to the pukapuka are valued and acknowledged by staff. Children&rsquo;s learning is celebrated.</p><p align="left">The collaborative kindergarten team has a shared understanding of their vision, philosophy and future goals. These are clearly evident in practice. Teachers value and use self review to inform improved practice, teaching and learning. Waitangirua Kindergarten is well placed to continue to provide high quality care and education for all children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Waitangirua Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atWaitangirua Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The 2008 ERO review was positive, noting that children learned within a warm, welcoming environment that reflected their cultural backgrounds. Strong, positive and culturally sensitive relationships established with wh&#257;nau were reflected in daily interactions.</p><p align="left">In 2009 the kindergarten reorganised its hours. It now operates on an all day licence for hours closely aligned to the school day and with consideration given to family group enrolments. Children attending come from a range of cultural backgrounds, the majority of whom are M&#257;ori and Pacific.</p><p align="left">The principles of the Treaty of Waitangi and bicultural practice are evident in the environment and underpin the programme. Children welcome visitors with support from Kaumatua and Matai.</p><h4>Programme</h4><p align="left">Te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori underpin the kindergarten&rsquo;s routines. Teachers and cultural aides support multi cultural practices within the programme. Wh&#257;nau and community strengths and interests contribute to the programme.</p><p align="left">The programme is well-considered and responsive to children&rsquo;s interests. Their curiosity is developed through child initiated activities. Children play and explore their environment for sustained periods of time. They confidently converse with their peers and adults, sharing learning and asking for assistance. Teachers use effective strategies to challenge and extend children&rsquo;s learning. Relationships with external agencies support children with diverse needs to be part of all aspects of the programme.</p><p align="left">Teachers plan collaboratively and share responsibility for children&rsquo;s learning and evaluative assessment. Interests are noticed, recognised and responded to in planning. Learning stories shows children&rsquo;s development over time. Documenting next steps within stories should help parents to see links and connections of children&rsquo;s past and future learning. Parents and wh&#257;nau contribute to assessment and share information about aspirations for their children.</p><p align="left">Children are beginning to contribute to their learning stories. This will further empower children to be involved in their own learning.</p><p align="left">The healthy living focus has been recognised by a Heart Foundation Healthy Heart Gold Award. Children learn about the natural world through their involvement in sustainable practices and their own gardens. This provides authentic learning experiences for children as they plant, tend, harvest and prepare the food.</p><p align="left">Literacy is embedded in the programme and is highly visible in the &ldquo;print saturated&rdquo; environment. Staff are using this model to continue to extend the use of and understanding of mathematical ideas.</p><h4>Environment</h4><p align="left">The high quality learning environment reflects children&rsquo;s diverse cultural heritage. Displays, artefacts, resources and structures are a feature and encourage involvement in cultural activities and interactions.</p><p align="left">A wide selection of equipment and resources encourages creative, adventurous and dramatic play. The diverse outdoor area provides opportunities for children to engage in challenging physical activities and quiet reflection time. Children move freely between activities and use readily accessible equipment and resources.</p><h4>Interactions</h4><p align="left">Whanaungatanga, partnerships and community engagement are central to Waitangirua Kindergarten&rsquo;s culture. Interactions are very warm, welcoming and nurturing. A culture of care and manaaki is embedded in relationships and actions. Families are treated with respect. Parents show a deep sense of trust in staff and are confident to discuss needs and interests with them.</p><h4>Leadership and self review</h4><p align="left">Staff are encouraged to learn and accept responsibilities and leadership roles. They are supported through focused professional development, time and resources. Their knowledge and strengths are used to facilitate learning and sharing of good practice. Teaching practice has been strengthened by using Te Manawa, the association&rsquo;s criteria for curriculum implementation.</p><p align="left">There is a shared understanding of the value, process and use of self review. Wellplanned self review informs changes within the programme, environment and children&rsquo;s learning stories.</p><h3>Association Support</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p align="left">Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p align="left">The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</li>
<li>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</li>
<li>a wide range of professional development opportunities</li>
<li>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>
<li>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</li>
<li>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice, as a result of feedback</li>
<li>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Waitangirua Kindergarten completed an ERO <em>Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-waitangirua-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Waitangirua Kindergarten</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Waitangirua Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Waitangirua Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is thelicensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support, advice and guidance to this teaching team, and for liaison with the kindergarten community.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten is situated in Porirua. Children attending come from twenty one cultural backgrounds, the majority of whom are M&#257;ori and Pacific. Children learn in an attractive, warm, welcoming environment in which their cultures are acknowledged, respected and celebrated. Cultural aides support children in their first language. Partnership with parents and wh&#257;nau is valued and contributes to the positive learning environment. Celebrating diversity, respecting and valuing difference underpins all that happens for children and staff.</p><p align="left">A highly positive and collaborative teaching team provides strong support and manaaki for children and their families. Warm, respectful relationships are evident between adults and children, and children and their peers. Relationships with local schools assist well-considered transitions for children and their wh&#257;nau.</p><p align="left">The programme promotes child-initiated learning. Children play cooperatively for sustained periods of time. They are confident and independent learners who accept and work through challenges. The concept of tuakana/teina is evident as children play and learn with each other. There is a focus on literacy, sustainable living and healthy life style. Te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori are evident within the environment and embedded in the programme.</p><p align="left">The children&rsquo;s ng&#257; pukapuka motuhake are treasured by all, include multiple teacher voices and provide a record of progress over time. Parents&rsquo; contributions to the pukapuka are valued and acknowledged by staff. Children&rsquo;s learning is celebrated.</p><p align="left">The collaborative kindergarten team has a shared understanding of their vision, philosophy and future goals. These are clearly evident in practice. Teachers value and use self review to inform improved practice, teaching and learning. Waitangirua Kindergarten is well placed to continue to provide high quality care and education for all children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Joyce Gebbie</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Central Region (Acting)</p></html>
