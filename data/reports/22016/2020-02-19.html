</table><p align="center" style="text-align: left;"><span>Freemans Bay Playcentre </span>is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Freemans Bay Playcentre is a well-established centre and operates as a parent cooperative. The centre is licensed for 28 children, including up to 15 children under two years of age. It is open for four sessions each week.</p><p>Centre practices are based on the Playcentre philosophy of families learning together. The centre's philosophy affirms parents as valued and best educators of their children. Sessions are guided <em>by Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. There is an expectation that te reo and tikanga Māori are included in sessions.</p><p>The 2015 ERO report identified a variety of good practices. Since 2015, centre members have focused on strengthening bicultural practices. There have been changes in centre membership. Most members are currently enrolled in Playcentre adult education courses.</p><p>The new Playcentre Aotearoa structure is now fully operational. It provides a sound management framework and support personnel to help parents/whānau to manage their centres. Playcentre Aotearoa administers centres’ funding and provides adult education programmes for parents/whānau to achieve Playcentre qualifications.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the Playcentre Aotearoa Auckland region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are capable and confident learners. They show a strong sense of ownership and belonging in the centre. Children have fun, play well in groups and are eager to learn. They develop independence, friendships and a positive attitude to learning in a welcoming and supportive environment.</p><p>Centre members provide a play-based programme. The learning environment is interesting and well-resourced, reflects children's interests and sustains their engagement in play and learning. Literacy, mathematics and science learning is integrated in meaningful ways. Enthusiasm for children’s creativity is reflected in a good provision of art and messy play materials.</p><p>Parents/whānau enthusiastically work alongside children, supporting their play and encouraging them to explore, experiment and make decisions. They provide extra resources, suggestions and encouragement to foster sustained play and respond quickly to comfort and assist children when needed. More experienced centre members model ways to engage children in sustained conversations and play that fosters learning.</p><p>Centre members' commitment to embedding te reo and tikanga Māori in the programme is evident. They are eager to continue to enrich their knowledge of bicultural practices. The cultural diversity and the strengths and abilities of children and their whānau are valued in the centre. Children are caring and inclusive of peers with differing ages, abilities and languages.</p><p>Parents/whānau work collaboratively to ensure infants can participate in all aspects of the programme. Toddlers actively explore the environment and join in activities with good support from adults. Tuakana/teina relationships are apparent in the ways that older children include younger peers in their play and act as role models. Children's curiosity and growing independence are fostered well, and their discoveries are valued by adults.</p><p>A strong sense of community and shared purpose underpin the centre culture. Centre members show a clear commitment to taking an active role in their children’s education and the operation of the centre. Newer centre members are well supported to build their knowledge of Playcentre philosophy and expectations. All parents are involved in programme planning, maintaining their own children's assessment portfolios and contributing to others.</p><p>Centre members have adopted planned approaches to implementing the Playcentre Aotearoa policy framework. They have many processes for internal evaluation. While much of their reflection and evaluation is not recorded in depth, whānau are highly consultative and decisions are made by consensus. Good quality meeting minutes provide evidence of reflection on practices and reporting by office-holders.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre members are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>engage in Playcentre adult education to build their confidence and enhance learning opportunities for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a shared understanding of and strengthen their processes for internal evaluation for improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make the continuity of children's learning more visible in assessment, planning and evaluation documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Key next steps for development in the Playcentre Aotearoa Auckland region include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening the use of internal evaluation to measure the effectiveness of systems and practices across the region.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Freemans Bay Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner<br>Director Review and Improvement Services<br>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</p><p>19 February 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
