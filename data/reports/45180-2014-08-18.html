</table><p>Pleasant Heights Preschool requires ongoing support to further develop aspects of:</p><ul>
<li>management</li>
<li>self review</li>
<li>leadership</li>
<li>teaching practice.</li>
</ul><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pleasant Heights Preschool is a large early childhood education service, located in Rotorua, adjacent to Western Heights Primary School. It provides all-day education and care for children from birth to school age. The centre, owned by Faith, a charitable trust, is licensed for 130 children, including 22 up to two years of age. The centre is organised into three age-based rooms, babies up to two years, Centre Two, two to three and a half years and Centre One, three and a half years to school age.</p><p>At the time of this review 79 children were enrolled, 65 being of Māori descent. The centre was previously known as Western Heights Pre-school Two. It has recently extended its licence under the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008.</p><p>In response to centre needs a Ministry of Education intervention has focused on assisting the centre to improve governance, management, administration, quality of the programme, environment and teaching practice. An ongoing challenge for the centre is the development and implementation of an appropriate induction programme for the high number of provisionally registered teachers.</p><p>The centre philosophy aspires to maintain a warm, trustworthy environment through fellowship by embracing the family, and implementing learning on every possible level. Aspects contributing to this aspiration include:</p><ul>
<li>giving children independence and freedom to play, and make informed choices</li>
<li>promoting ethical values, and love for individual children</li>
<li>experiencing diverse cultures, nurturing New Zealand’s native heritage, and honouring te Tiriti o Waitangi</li>
<li>providing a welcoming environment for families where positive values are maintained.</li>
</ul><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre management has responded positively to advice and support provided by the Ministry of Education and specialist consultants to strengthen aspects of governance, management and administration. This has resulted in the establishment of effective frameworks for maintaining regularly reviewed policies and procedures. A strategic and annual plan to guide centre direction has been developed in consultation with centre staff and whānau.</p><p>The licensee and trustees are dedicated to minimising barriers to participation for tamariki and families through the introduction of an affordable fee structure, and provision of transport to and from the centre. They have inclusive and long-standing relationships with the local and wider community, including the adjacent primary school.</p><p>The licensee and head teachers have established respectful and reciprocal relationships with families and children. There are open and transparent communication processes where teachers and families share ideas, raise issues, and make decisions. Centre leaders meet regularly to discuss teaching practice, children's wellbeing and learning.</p><p>Tamariki and families demonstrate a strong sense of belonging through the services ‘stay and play’ approach. Transition processes are responsive to the individual needs of children and families and contribute to children’s confidence and resilience.</p><p>Teachers plan and provide programmes that are based on nga tamariki interests. There is a focus on developing children's empathy for others and self management skills. Teachers naturally integrate te reo and tikanga Māori into the programme. Māori concepts such as aroha, whanaungatanga, manaakitanga, and tuakana/teina are highly evident across the centre.</p><p>Tamariki have access to spacious indoor and outdoor environments and an appropriate range of equipment and resources. ERO observed children making choices, experimenting and exploring interests over time. Teachers and leaders express the desire to include a greater emphasis on natural resources and opportunities for children to explore and learn about gifts of Papatuanuku and the natural world.</p><p>Teachers maintain clear records and displays of current programmes, nga tamariki interests and learning. Individual assessment portfolios are attractively presented and enable children to share their progress and celebrate successes with others. Parents are increasingly contributing their views and aspirations for their tamariki.</p><p>Teachers and leaders foster sensitive and nurturing relationships that value children for who they are and what they bring to the service. Teachers promote early concepts of literacy and mathematics in the context of children’s play and through their conversations with children. They consistently make use of a variety of strategies, including positive guidance to invite children’s participation in programmes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that important areas for continued development are:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening centre self review and quality assurance processes</li>
<li>establishing effective appraisal processes to ensure that teachers receive regular and useful feedback linked to documented, shared and agreed ‘best practice’ in age-specific areas</li>
<li>accessing professional development, support and mentoring for the licensee in relationship to educational leadership and management of the centre, including teacher registration requirements</li>
<li>strengthening the knowledge and confidence of head teachers to ensure ‘best practice’ in relation to age specific grouping of children</li>
<li>extending the curriculum to include local history, places of significance to tangata whenua and the language culture and identity of each child.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pleasant Heights Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to aspects of hygienic practices for infants.</p><p>To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>maintaining a safe and hygienic environment for children</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, PF15</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pleasant Heights Pre-School will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>18 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
