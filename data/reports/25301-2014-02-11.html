</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mangere East Family Service Centre is a well established centre which shares the same site as the Mangere East Family Service. It provides care and education for children from infancy to school age, the majority being of Māori or Pacific Island descent.</p><p>The centre is well staffed by a team of qualified teachers who reflect community diversity and provide high adult-to child-ratios. Children under two have a space for quiet time but spend most of the day with the older children. Since the 2011 ERO review teachers have been involved in professional development to improve teaching practices. Some well established management practices, and the encouragement of partnerships with parents and whānau continue to be evident in centre practices and procedures. Managers plan to extend the centre and improve the outdoor area.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn in a well resourced and welcoming environment. Thoughtfully presented play areas encourage children to explore and select from a range of materials. Their work is prominently displayed, as are photos of children and their whānau. The multicultural backgrounds of the families and community are strongly evident throughout the centre. Easy access to the outdoors promotes good opportunities for physical challenge and imaginative play. This environment is inviting and inclusive for adults and children.</p><p>Managers’ and teachers’ commitment to biculturalism is strength of the centre. Teachers use words and phrases in te reo Māori during routines and conversations, and in waiata and dance. They show respect for tikanga Māori. Prominent displays inform families of the importance of Māori language and culture. Centre practices and the environment acknowledge Aotearoa New Zealand’s bicultural heritage and this multicultural community.</p><p>Children are confident and eager learners. They play cooperatively, enjoy singing, dancing and being part of group games. Children make choices about activities they wish to join in. Teachers interact with children in positive and affirming ways. Children share their home languages with teachers and their peers include others of differing ages and abilities. They are developing friendships, empathy for others, and positive attitudes to learning.</p><p>Warm and responsive relationships between adults and children are a positive feature of the centre. Teachers work together collegially and supportively. They cheerfully greet and talk with parents and children as they arrive and leave. Teachers know children and their families well and use this knowledge to respond to and affirm children as individuals.</p><p>There are many opportunities for community and family involvement in the centre. Teachers regularly communicate with whānau about their children’s development and learning. Frequent visits from local community members, student teachers and other professionals are welcomed. Parents/whānau and the community are encouraged to be active partners in children’s education. The manager and teachers are keen to strengthen partnership with whānau to support children’s learning.</p><p>Teachers provide a family focused early childhood programme based on a culture of care and respect for children and their whānau. Infants and toddlers benefit from individualised nurturing care and interaction with older children. Transitions into the centre and to school are responsive to individual children and whānau needs.</p><p>Teachers have well established group planning to guide programme implementation. Vibrant displays show how children are involved in centre projects. Teachers are working to increase their responsiveness to individual children’s interests and affirm the strengths children bring. They are keen to increase bicultural perspectives in stories about children’s learning.</p><p>Centre managers review policies and procedures and have clear management plans to guide the centre’s future direction. They are aware that self review could be more robust, collaborative and child focused.</p><p>The centre manager is supportive of teachers, aware of their needs and encourages professional development. They are seeking ways to implement an appropriately documented appraisal process with stronger reflection on teaching practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager and teachers agree that next steps to support ongoing review and improvement could include:</p><ul>
<li>developing a robust process for self review that involves teachers, whānau and children, and focuses on educational opportunities and outcomes for children</li>
<li>teachers increasing the use of sustained conversations that encourage children to problem solve, think independently and engage in more complex learning opportunities</li>
<li>implementing a robust appraisal process that increases teachers' reflection about their practice and the impact of professional development</li>
<li>strengthening teachers’ assessment and planning processes to show how children’s individual interests were noticed, responded to and built on over time.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mangere East Family Service Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Prior to the ERO review centre managers identified that they need to develop an emergency management plan. ERO also identified other areas of non-compliance. The centre manager must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>robust appraisal processes are implemented for all staff and managers,<em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008; GMA7</em></li>
<li>centre policies and procedures are consistently implemented and are aligned to the health and safety practices standard,<em>Education <br>(Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008 (R 46).</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mangere East Family Service Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>17 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
