</table><p>Alphabet Academy Roslyn is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Alphabet Academy Roslyn is one of two early learning services under the Vision Community Trust umbrella. They are governed by a trust board. Day-to-day management of the centres is the responsibility of the manager. The long serving head teacher works with staff to design and implement the centre’s curriculum. Currently, four teachers hold full practising certificates.</p><p>At any one time, the centre is licensed for 45 children, including 15 up to two years of age, in the purpose-built centre. The roll includes 13 Māori children and 13 of Pacific heritage.</p><p>The centre philosophy is strongly underpinned by Christian values and virtues. Children are encouraged to show manaakitanga with their peers and teachers, reflect their individuality and their God-given talents. The kawa of respect, aligns the centre's Christian values to Māori concepts.</p><p>The May 2016 ERO evaluation identified staff needed to improve and develop: understanding and practices in effective internal evaluation; assessing and supporting children’s ongoing learning; and fostering opportunities for Māori children to experience educational success. Centre leaders developed an improvement plan to address these issues and provided ERO with ongoing evidence of progress. Governors and leaders responded positively to this requirement and evidence shows some steady progress has been achieved.</p><p>This review was part of two reviews in the Alphabet Academy Centres.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's holistic development and learning is supported through their active engagement in well-considered planned and spontaneous learning experiences. The curriculum is underpinned by the principles of <em>Te Whāriki.</em></p><p>Strong links to home learning and ongoing communication occurs with parents and whānau. Teachers know children well. Narrative assessment learning stories show children's interests and developing dispositions are responded to through appropriate teaching strategies and more challenging experiences.</p><p>Māori, and all, children experience an increasingly culturally responsive curriculum. Te ao Māori and te reo Māori are an integral part of children's daily experience. Planned professional learning in the <em>Tapasā, Cultural Competencies Framework for Teachers of Pacific learners</em>, is likely to further strengthen the curriculum and practice in support of Pacific learners and fanau.</p><p>Teachers are respectful and responsive to the needs and preferences of infants and toddlers. These very young children actively explore and learn in a nurturing, calm and secure environment. Teachers follow their lead as they promote their active engagement in well-designed experiences and activities. Children's social and emotional competence is nurtured through meaningful interactions with adults.</p><p>A positive tone and settled environment enables children to feel secure in their learning and confident in their response with adults and their peers. They know the rituals and routines of the environment and able to follow their own rhythms. Children listen and respond well to their peers showing respect for each other.</p><p>Transition practices are well considered and support children entering and leaving the service. Centre leaders are continuing to strengthen their relationships with local schools to further develop these practices.</p><p>Self review for accountability purposes and improvement is suitably implemented. Strategic goals reflect centre priorities. Annual goals are informed by relevant action plans. Regular monitoring of centre systems and processes is increasingly contributing to consistency of practice across the centres.</p><p>Centre leaders effectively manage daily operation and promote the agreed goals of the service. Involvement of staff in professional learning and development is well aligned to their identified priorities. Collaborative practice between staff ensures a cohesive response in meeting the needs of learners. Trustees are continuing to build their professional capability in systems and processes to improve sustainable governance practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders, management and ERO agree on the following priorities for ongoing improvement:</p><ul>
<li>as part of the planned philosophy review, teachers should evaluate how effectively valued outcomes are enacted and contribute to improved outcomes for children and their families</li>
<li>further develop governance practice to build collective knowledge and capability to undertake the roles and responsibilities</li>
<li>continue to develop teacher inquiry, so that staff look into the effectiveness of their practice and consistently identify significant learning and the desired outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Alphabet Academy Roslyn completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>28 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
