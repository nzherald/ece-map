</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Gonville Kindergarten is situated in Whanganui. It is one of 14 kindergartens administered by the Whanganui Kindergarten Association (WKA). The kindergarten is licensed to provide all day education and care for 40 children, age two to five years. All teachers are qualified and registered with a range of teaching experiences.</p><p>The governing board is responsible for setting the overall strategic direction for the WKA. The day-to-day running of the association is the role of the general manager, who is responsible to the board. Two senior teachers are employed to support the learning and development of teachers. Two cultural advisors were recently been appointed to support teachers to realise potential and support success for Māori and Pacific children.</p><p>Teachers have responded in a considered way to the areas for improvement in the September 2012 ERO report. Development has been well supported by focused professional learning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Whanganui Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten philosophy is focused on whanaungatanga which influences teaching practice and provides close relationships with families and the community. It directly connects to the Priorities for Children’s Learning, which have been collaboratively developed by teachers, children, whānau, community, iwi, local schools and the association. The spirit of a community of learners is strongly evident.</p><p>Te ao Māori and the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum are clearly evident and influence ongoing curriculum development. Children’s holistic growth is promoted through developing their sense of belonging, wellbeing and social competence.</p><p>A calm, unhurried and positive tone prevails. Interactions between adults and children are nurturing, respectful and reciprocal. Families and whānau are warmly welcomed and work in partnership with teachers to support their children’s learning.</p><p>Children enthusiastically participate in a varied and culturally rich curriculum. Te Tiriti o Waitangi based practices are honoured, enacted and recognised in models of good practice. A Pacific teacher and teacher aide speak to children in their home languages.</p><p>Leaders and teachers use assessment information well. Individual learning portfolios celebrate children’s achievements, culture and learning as well as their developing skills, knowledge and attitudes. Teachers analyse assessment information to identify children requiring additional support and inform ongoing programme planning.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to determine the direction of their own learning. Teachers support this skilfully. They are intentional in the teaching strategies they use and provide children with complex learning experiences. Many activities include te ao Māori, Samoan and the learning of literacy, mathematical and science skills. Children’s learning is further enhanced through regular outings and experiences in the community. Highly inclusive practices help all children and whānau to celebrate their differences.</p><p>Children and whānau transitioning into the kindergarten and to school are well supported. Positive relationships and dialogue between kindergarten and school personnel greatly assists this process. The head teacher networks with a range of professional leaders to pursue the best outcomes for children locally.</p><p>Internal evaluation for improvement is well understood and effectively guides ongoing change and decision- making. It provides a useful framework for teachers to reflect on their practice. This process is aligned to policies, procedures, philosophy, and all aspects of teaching and learning and is responsive to the cultural curriculum. Leaders and teachers and ERO agrees that using this process as a tool to better understand the impact of practices on outcomes for children will further strengthen internal evaluation.</p><p>A useful appraisal process supports teachers to reflect on their practice in relation to professional teaching requirements. The association leadership team is in the process of implementing a revised approach. This should include focused observations of teachers’ practice in relation to their professional goals. Once the new approach is fully implemented, evaluation of its impact on teachers’ development should be a next step for the association.</p><p>The kindergarten annual plan reflects the association’s strategic direction and incorporates the priorities for children’s learning. Teachers at Gonville Kindergarten have a strong sense of ownership of their annual plan.</p><p>The head teacher values children and teachers for who they are and what they bring to the kindergarten. She provides staff with opportunities to build their own leadership capability. These link to appraisal and focus on teacher inquiry and research. Teachers are collaborative and highly reflective practitioners who seek out current theory and best practice to adapt their teaching. They are advocates for all children.</p><p>The ‘Priorities for Children’s Learning’ kindergarten initiative is guided by the senior teachers’ response to a recent ERO National Evaluation report. This comprehensive, sound and strategic framework is being used to strengthen planning, assessment and evaluation processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher, head teacher, staff and ERO agree on the following key next step to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to evaluate how well teachers support the development of children’s social competencies to further strengthen teacher practices to support all children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Gonville Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Gonville Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>23 December 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children.

<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
