</table><p>Fundamentals Merivale Preschool is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fundamentals Merivale is one of two privately owned centres owned and operated by the current owner. It was opened in 2013 in a large villa and provides full-day care and education for up to 50 children including 12 children under two years of age.</p><p>The leadership team is made up of a supervising manager, an assistant manager and a lead teacher in the preschool and nursery. Other teachers have leadership roles in the daily running of the centre.</p><p>Concepts of physical development and challenge underpin the centre's programme to support children to think, act and succeed in mind, body and spirit and to be confident learners.</p><p>This review was part of the review of the two centres in the Fundamentals Preschool organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers welcome children and their families and use a number of effective ways to help children settle easily into the programme. They are comforted promptly, where necessary, and sensitively helped to settle into the programme.</p><p>Children learn through a range of structured activities, and planned group times. During the day children have free choices in their learning. Teachers provide a good range of opportunities for children to develop their imaginative and creative play, and to follow their interests.</p><p>Teachers give literacy and numeracy prominence in the programme during group times. In the best practices observed, teachers integrated these skills and understandings in meaningful ways during children’s free play.</p><p>Teachers deliberately plan for the intended learning. They regularly reflect on the programme and the intended outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers sometimes use te reo and tikanga Māori and phrases with children to increase their understanding of New Zealand's bicultural heritage.</p><p>Transition into and within the centre is well planned and managed.</p><p>The quality of interactions with teachers and children is variable across the centre. In the preschool a high proportion of the morning programme involves teacher-directed activities. This limits children’s ability to follow their interests and make decisions about their own learning. Effective interactions observed included teachers having meaningful conversations with children about their learning.</p><p>Children would benefit from greater opportunities to explore, to experiment and make their own discoveries. They would also benefit from having more in depth and meaningful conversations with teachers about their learning and to extend their thinking.</p><p>Children in the under two programme each have caring, calm interactions with primary nursery teachers who are familiar to them. They help strengthen children's sense of attachment and growing independence as they progress through their time in the nursery.</p><p>In the nursery ERO observed:</p><ul>
<li>caring, nurturing and responsive interactions between children and teachers</li>
<li>calm and unhurried routines</li>
<li>a well-resourced learning environment</li>
<li>teachers communicating with each other about children’s needs and routines.</li>
</ul><p>The Fundamentals Preschool owners and leaders have provided suitable resources and equipment to support the philosophy of children's physical development.</p><p>As a result of research and professional learning and development (PLD):</p><ul>
<li>teaching teams are working more collaboratively</li>
<li>the appraisal process has been improved to meet the requirements of the Teachers Council and is more effective in improving teaching practices. It now needs to be further strengthened by including more critical and formal feedback to individual teachers.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders have identified priorities for improvement through evaluation practices, including gathering parents' ideas and opinions. Relevant PLD and appraisal goals have been aligned to the areas for improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified and the licensee and head teacher agree, that the following next steps would support the on-going improvement to provide high-quality learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>Leaders and teachers now need to review and evaluate the:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum to ensure it is responsive to children’s strengths, interests and capabilities</li>
<li>quality and depth of interactions between teachers and children.</li>
</ul><p>Fundamentals Preschool leaders need to:</p><ul>
<li>develop a strategic plan that shows how the identified priorities for improvement will be progressed over a two to three year period</li>
<li>develop evaluation practices so that the effectiveness of programmes and interactions, in relation to centre's philosophy and policies</li>
<li>develop a procedural manual.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Fundamentals Merivale will be in three years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>27 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
