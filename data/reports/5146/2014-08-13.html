</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hukanui Kindergarten is located in Chartwell, Hamilton and provides sessional education and care for children from two years to school age. The kindergarten is licensed to provide education and care for up to 40 children over the age of two years at any one time. At the time of this ERO review 80 children were enrolled, of whom 12 are identified as Māori.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable trust, and does not operate for profit. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement ‘Every child reaching their full potential’. This emphasises a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. All kindergartens provide an <em>Enviro-School</em> focus as a key curriculum feature to encourage children to better understand caring for the environment.</p><p>The Educational Service Manager (ESM) monitors and reports to the association on the kindergarten’s quality of education. A kaumātua from Tainui provides advice, guidance and support about Māori language, culture and identity. The kindergarten’s administrative responsibilities are well supported by association resource personnel.</p><p>The kindergarten benefits from the WKA's clear guidelines and expectations for practice, and the availability of good self-review processes for monitoring and evaluating the quality of education and care it provides for children.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy states that children learn best in an environment that is safe and welcoming. It is noted that <em>Te Whāriki</em> and the Treaty of Waitangi will be reflected throughout the programme, which will be primarily based on children’s strengths and interests. The whānau and wider community are recognised as having a vital role in the kindergarten.</p><p>Since the last ERO review the kindergarten has continued to develop bicultural practice. Staffing has remained stable and the kindergarten has been renovated to provide an area where children’s artistic and creative development is encouraged. An additional outdoor area has been developed as a natural play space. The kindergarten is part of a programme that promotes a sustainable environment, which influences its philosophy, planning and programme. Teachers also implement a programme to promote children’s health and wellbeing.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 12 kindergarten reviews in the Waikato Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are welcomed and quickly settle to explore and play in the attractive, well-resourced environment. Teachers encourage children to follow their interests and choose freely from a variety of well-presented, challenging learning opportunities, including:</p><ul>
<li>artistic and creative activities</li>
<li>imaginative play</li>
<li>construction, using blocks, carpentry and a variety of other materials</li>
<li>active play that develops muscle skills and a sense of balance</li>
<li>sand and water play, working cooperatively or as individuals to explore theories</li>
<li>natural materials.</li>
</ul><p>Children have many opportunities to investigate the world of nature and learn how to take care of themselves and the environment.</p><p>Skilled and experienced teachers know children well. They support and extend children’s learning by listening to their ideas, using questions to prompt further thinking, and suggesting new possibilities to investigate. Teachers ensure that children are increasingly competent in using oral language to communicate with others, taking regular opportunities to work with children who are speakers of other languages. They naturally integrate te reo Māori, literacy and mathematics as important aspects of the daily programme. Children develop good social skills and are supported to make easy transitions to school.</p><p>Teachers also support the identity of Māori children by incorporating tikanga Māori, through singing waiata, using karakia to bless the food, and featuring poi, rākau and piupiu. They are increasingly developing their understanding of other cultures and developing ways of acknowledging them in the programme.</p><p>Teachers plan the programme to respond to children’s individual and group interests, and also to introduce new ideas and experiences. They observe children’s play and exploration, and share their understanding of the learning with parents through interesting displays. Teachers use this information to plan the environment and their teaching interactions. They record assessment information about children’s individual and group experiences in portfolios. Teachers have a very good understanding of individual children’s learning. They prepare summaries of children’s progress and development to share with parents.</p><p>It would be beneficial for teachers to review their current learning story assessments to develop practices that track the individual learning of each child over time. Consideration needs to be given to making the process manageable for the high number of children attending this sessional centre.</p><p>Whanaungatanga and manaakitanga are highly evident throughout the kindergarten. The environment is welcoming, inviting and homelike. Teachers and children have recycled furniture using natural materials to provide comfortable working areas and accessible storage. The environment provides many opportunities for children to investigate the world of nature and learn how to take care of the environment.</p><p>Teachers have developed strong, reciprocal and respectful partnerships with parents and whānau. Parents often show a sense of belonging to this learning community. They spend time in the kindergarten, listening to mat time, participating alongside children, and contributing to the programme. They value the kindergarten’s philosophy of free play, and teachers’ responsiveness to their aspirations for their children. Parents readily participate in events and trips into the wider community.</p><p>The head teacher is highly experienced, knowledgeable and supportive of staff. She develops strong, reciprocal partnerships with parents and whānau, and works to fulfil the vision and philosophy of the kindergarten. The collaborative staff team focuses on kindergarten goals. Its members share their individual strengths and respond to opportunities for leadership. There is an overall commitment to building professional practice. Teachers recognise the value of focusing programme self review and teacher reflections on the quality of outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identifies, and service managers agree, that teachers should give consideration to reviewing learning story assessments to:</p><ul>
<li>make each child’s learning visible</li>
<li>show how individual children’s learning is developing over time.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hukanui Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hukanui Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>13 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
