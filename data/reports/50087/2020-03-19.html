</table><p>Lots of Hugs Childcare 2 is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lots of Hugs Childcare 2 is located near the central business district of Palmerston North. The service is licensed to provide education and care for 52 children, including 15 aged up to two years. Separate areas are organised for over two-year-olds, and infants and toddlers. Of the 60 children enrolled at the time of this ERO review, 20 identify as Māori.</p><p>The service is one of two local centres owned by Kids World Childcare Limited, whose staff provide administrative and governance support. A newly appointed area manager supports the local operation of four centres in the Manawatu/Rangitikei area. She is also the centre manager and is supported by an assistant manager and team leader.</p><p>The centre philosophy promotes the values of identity, respect, social relationships, expression, inquiry, and independence.</p><p>The March 2017 ERO report identified key next steps in relation to strengthening systems to build leaders' and teachers' capability and defining clarity around leadership roles. Some progress is evident in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's philosophy is clearly evident in practice. An emphasis on developing strong relationships between children, teachers and whānau promotes consistency of care. Parents are valued for the knowledge they bring to the service. Relationships are warm and responsive.</p><p>Children enthusiastically engage in a range of child-initiated, play-based experiences. Teachers select and introduce a variety of learning opportunities as part of individual and group programme planning. E-profiles record learners' participation and enjoyment in activities of choice. Observations of children in everyday activities build a picture of what they know, understand, feel and can do.</p><p>Infants are encouraged to become active communicators and explorers. Programme provision for these very young learners focuses on nurturing their wellbeing through responsive caregiving. Teachers are attuned to children's non-verbal cues. Adults play and work alongside children and support their developing skills.</p><p>Teachers continue to further their understanding of ways to reflect and respond to Māori learners. Te reo Māori is heard throughout the daily programme. Te ao Māori is reflected in the environment, activities and resources. Manaakitanga is highly evident. Leaders and teachers should continue to introduce ways to promote te ao Māori through a local, place-based curriculum.</p><p>Transitions in to the centre are flexible and responsive to the needs of individual learners and families. Children are well supported for their move to school. Teachers assist older children to plan their own learning and help them to further develop the skills and dispositions to promote their seamless transitions.</p><p>Children requiring additional support are promptly identified, planned for and very well supported in their learning and wellbeing. Teachers work collaboratively with parents to create purposeful and achievable goals. They work hard to access external support as available.</p><p>A clear vision sets direction for the service and guides long and short term planning. Teachers engage in systematic, on-going evaluation that is responsive to service priorities. This has led to improvements in the environment and teaching practice. Maintaining a clearer focus on promoting positive outcomes for children should further strengthen internal evaluation.</p><p>Regular appraisal effectively supports the development of teacher capability. Professional learning opportunities are ongoing and informed by teachers' goals and service priorities. There is a strong focus on continual improvement through inquiry. Collaborative leadership is encouraged. Leaders agree that strengthening observation of teacher practice should include opportunities for constructive critique. The groups operation manager should ensure that the newly appointed area manager is appraised against the <em>Standards for the Teaching Profession.</em></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and ERO agree that the key next steps are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>refine assessment and planning practices to guide future teaching and learning</li>
<li>strengthen internal evaluation and teacher appraisal.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lots of Hugs Childcare 2 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Leaders and ERO agree that the key next steps are to continue to: refine assessment and planning practices to guide future teaching and learning strengthen internal evaluation and teacher appraisal.</p><p>Darcy Te Hau</p><p>Acting Director Review and Improvement Services (Central)</p><p><span>Central Region - Te Tai Pūtahi Nui</span></p><p>19 March 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
