</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids Rock Early Learning Centre is a privately owned early childhood centre situated in the rural Waikato town of Tirau. The service provides education and care for children from birth to school age in two adjacent, age-based rooms. The centre is licensed for up to 50 children, including 15 aged under two. At the time of this ERO review there were 62 children, including 20 children who are of Māori descent.</p><p>Since the previous ERO report of June 2011, new owners have governed and managed the service, one of whom is the Service Provider. Head teachers who have leadership responsibility for each of the age-based areas have been appointed. A number of new teachers have joined the teaching team.</p><p>Some good progress has been made in the area for development identified in the 2011 ERO report about assessment and programme planning. Teachers have participated in relevant professional development and are now providing a programme for children which is more centred on their interests and includes flexible routines to meet their needs. In addition, positive and meaningful partnerships with whānau are being established. The new centre owners highly value the integration of Māori perspectives to promote success for Māori children. They are building the opportunities for children to learn about New Zealand as a bicultural society.</p><p>As identified in the 2011 ERO report, the new centre owners agree that there continues to be a need to:</p><ul>
<li>develop strategic planning that reflects community aspirations</li>
<li>strengthen self-review processes to identify specific priorities for centre improvement and development</li>
<li>support teachers to increase their confidence and competence in the use of te reo and tikanga Māori practices.</li>
</ul><p>The centre philosophy places priority on promoting positive and inclusive relationships with families and whānau, and providing a supportive and stimulating environment for children’s learning and development. Centre owners are working actively towards achieving these objectives.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Families and whānau are welcomed into an environment that is well designed and equipped to provide for the education and care of infants, toddlers and older children.</p><p>Teachers in the under two-year-old area are responsive and respectful practitioners. They work in a positive partnership, and have a shared approach to providing high-quality care for children. Infants and toddlers are calm, confident and settled. They demonstrate high levels of enjoyment as they socialise, communicate and play alongside their teachers and peers. Teachers offer nurture and affection to children during flexible care routines. Particular strengths are evident in the way infants and toddlers are encouraged to develop and progress at their own pace, solve problems, and experience challenge as they explore and investigate the interesting centre environment.</p><p>Children in the over-two area enjoy ready access to a wide variety of good quality equipment and materials.</p><p>ERO observed some examples of good teaching practice. These included:</p><ul>
<li>meaningful learning conversations with children</li>
<li>integrating concepts of early literacy and number into children’s play</li>
<li>opportunities to extend children’s thinking and problem solving skills</li>
<li>encouraging children to use and build on their self-managing and self-care skills.</li>
</ul><p>Centre leaders now need to ensure these good practices are consistently evident amongst all staff.</p><p>A particular strength of the curriculum is the focus on exploration evident in the environment, planning and children’s learning stories. The visually appealing and creatively planned indoor and outdoor environment provides physical challenge and promotes learning about natural science. It enables children to make choices, follow their curiosity, and explore alongside their friends. An important next step is for teachers to plan, assess and evaluate programmes that better engage active learners and boys in sustained, meaningful and purposeful learning.</p><p>Teachers record aspects of children’s participation in the programme in attractive displays and individual profile books. These books enable children, families and teachers to share and revisit learning together. An important next step is for teachers to make the language, culture and identity of each child and their family central to their learning, and evident in centre displays and profile books. Teachers and ERO agree that there is now a need to document the many ways that teachers foster children’s developing communication skills.</p><p>Head teachers are experienced practitioners who model appropriate early childhood practices that promote quality learning experiences for children. They are establishing a collegial approach to teaching. In addition, they are increasingly sharing professional knowledge and promoting regular development opportunities. There are clear expectations for roles and responsibilities. This is contributing to greater consistency in day-to-day organisation and centre operations.</p><p>The centre owners have implemented initiatives that contribute to effective governance, and which have resulted in positive outcomes for children and their families. These initiatives include:</p><ul>
<li>leaders seeking appropriate guidance and support from external agencies and the Ministry of Education</li>
<li>appointing capable and experienced head teachers for each age-based area</li>
<li>implementing self review, which has led to improved communication processes and a more child-centred curriculum</li>
<li>establishing positive and meaningful relationships with staff, children and families</li>
<li>providing relevant and ongoing professional learning and development for all staff.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that the key next steps for development are for leaders to improve self-review systems and processes, giving particular attention to:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing the centre philosophy in consultation with families, whānau, teachers and children</li>
<li>making greater use of Ministry of Education guidelines</li>
<li>developing, implementing and documenting systems and frameworks for reporting and monitoring progress towards strategic goals and priorities</li>
<li>strengthening the teacher appraisal system.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that centre leaders seek support from the Ministry of Education to:</p><ul>
<li>build teachers' knowledge, understanding and integration of te ao Māori perspectives across the curriculum</li>
<li>ensure strategies for positively and respectfully managing children’s behaviour are known and consistently implemented by all teachers</li>
<li>plan, assess and evaluate a curriculum that is responsive to the needs of active learners, particularly older boys.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids Rock Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids Rock Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>26 June 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
