</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Matairangi Community Kindergarten is located in Hataitai, Wellington and is an important part of the Hataitai Community House. Plunket and a playgroup, other community services within this building, complement the kindergarten. The centre is licensed for 22 and caters for children aged from seventeen months to three years and six months. Of the 46 children enrolled, four are Māori. This kindergarten model was established to meet community needs, primarily for children aged under two years old. A recent development is children's increased access to the outside area to enhance their enjoyment of the environment.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy promotes a welcoming, fun and loving environment that reflects the values of manaakitanga, wairuatanga, kaitiakitanga, rangatiratanga and kotahitanga.</p><p>Matairangi Community Kindergarten is one of 85 kindergartens and three home-based education and care networks governed and managed by He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). This is a new kindergarten association created from joining the Rimutaka and Wellington Kindergarten Associations in 2014.</p><p>The board and managers provide governance for the organisation. Senior teachers have delegated kindergartens. Their role is to provide regular support and a range of professional learning and development opportunities for teachers.</p><p>In 2012, the association developed a framework to guide the implementation of its curriculum, Te Manawa. This document outlines criteria for curriculum delivery, including expectations for assessment and planning for children’s learning.</p><p>The July 2012 ERO report for Matairangi Community Kindergarten identified that teachers needed to enhance aspects of teaching and learning. Areas where the association could strengthen its support for teachers were also identified, and positive progress has occurred. The alignment of individual kindergartens’ annual plans with the association’s strategic priorities has now been appropriately addressed.</p><p>All four teachers at the kindergarten are qualified and registered. Staff changes since the previous ERO report include a new head teacher and two teachers.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The programme is child-initiated. Teachers effectively respond to children’s emerging interests by providing inviting experiences that link to a range of curriculum areas. Children frequently revisit their previous activities and learning captured in their portfolios.</p><p>The centre is well resourced and organised for children. Wall displays successfully document the learning and planning happening for children. The outdoor area suitably provides for physical activity and investigation of the living world. Early literacy and numeracy understandings are integrated into the programme.</p><p>Teachers consider that children are competent and capable and encourage them to make choices. Positive guidance is used effectively to promote social competence and independence in self-care. A calm and purposeful tone is evident throughout the session. Teachers have a clear focus on ensuring that practices are supportive and inclusive.</p><p>Secure, child-teacher-family relationships encourage the development of children's identity. Their wellbeing is nurtured and they settle happily. The practice of teachers as primary caregivers helps to ensure the specific needs of infants, toddlers and their families are recognised and well catered for. Their transition to the next early childhood setting area is sensitively managed and children are well supported as they prepare for this move.</p><p>Teachers' responses effectively support participation, attendance and engagement of Māori children and their families. Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori continue to be successfully embedded within teaching and learning. Teachers show a willingness to increase their capability to be responsive to Māori children’s culture, language and identity.</p><p>Practices to support continuing improvement and evaluate progress are strengthening. The head teacher is working very well with her team to grow a shared understanding of effective practice. Internal evaluation for improvement continues to develop and contributes to positive changes in the kindergarten.</p><p>The senior teacher provides termly written feedback that outlines agreed development priorities and progress in relation to the quality of teaching and learning. She completes an annual internal evaluation that supports strengthening of these termly reports. There is a deliberate focus on outcomes for children and teacher/leader performance.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified that the association needed to improve the appraisal process. Managers undertook an internal review of the appraisal system. The revised model is being implemented across the kindergartens. The process includes focused goals that build teacher and leader capability and clearer links with the Practising Teacher Criteria.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher, head teacher, staff and ERO agree on the following key next steps for Matairangi Community Kindergarten:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further refine and embed assessment, planning and evaluation practices to guide teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop and use shared understandings of internal evaluation to enhance teaching and learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association should continue to support the development of formal critique of teaching practice.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Matairangi Community Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Matairangi Community Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>14 July 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
