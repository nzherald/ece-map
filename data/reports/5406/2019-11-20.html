</table><p>Stoke Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Stoke Kindergarten is situated in Nelson. It provides all-day education and care for up to 40 children, aged over two years.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy emphasises the importance of working together to foster respect and build foundations for future learning in a fun and supportive environment. Ehara taku toa i te toa takitahi, he toa takitini; ‘My Strength is not mine alone, but the strength of many’. This service is a member of the Enviroschools programme reaching silver level to promote environmentally sustainable practices.</p><p>A new head teacher has recently been appointed. They manage the day-to-day operations and support for the teaching team. All teachers are fully qualified.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed and managed by the Nelson Tasman Kindergarten Association (the association). Since the 2013 ERO reviews, a new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has been appointed. The CEO and a board of trustees are responsible for the governance of the kindergarten. A team of senior education advisors (SEA) oversee and support the professional practice of the teaching team. The 2018 ERO reviews identified a number of key next steps for the board. These included improving their planning to support the achievement of the board’s strategic objectives and ensuring that reporting is evaluative and focuses on outcomes for children. Progress is ongoing.</p><p>ERO's September 2013 report identified key next steps for this kindergarten. These included continuing to build the capacity of teachers to evaluate and continuing to develop assessment documentation. Progress in these areas is ongoing.</p><p>This review was one of four kindergartens in the Nelson Tasman Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers use a wide range of strategies to effectively engage with children in a play-based programme. Children are encouraged to explore, problem solve and lead their own learning. They experience warm and respectful relationships with teachers and their peers.</p><p>Sustainable practices are effectively promoted. Children’s understanding of the living world is enriched through meaningful learning experiences that promote environmental sustainability.</p><p>The kindergarten’s philosophy has recently been reviewed by leaders and teachers. A next step is to consult with parents and whānau Māori to determine what educational success looks for them. This should assist the teaching team to develop a shared understanding of what learning matters in this context.</p><p>Children's sense of belonging is highly evident in the programme. It is promoted through their parents and whānau contributing to their learning. A well-considered transition to school process is effectively supported by teachers.</p><p>Meaningful kaupapa Māori based concepts, and teacher led activities that include te reo and waiata Māori, enrich the programme. Whānau expertise is used to further extend children’s learning. Teachers have identified that furthering their knowledge and implementation of bicultural practices is required.</p><p>Group planning provides a shared learning focus and enhances the programme. The teaching team should continue to work with the association to develop a useful planning for learning framework that guides group and individual learning. Once this is established, teachers should be able to evaluate the impact of the programme on children's learning.</p><p>Children’s assessment documentation provides a useful record of their engagement, friendships and emerging interests. Key next steps are for leaders and teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>acknowledge the breadth of the curriculum</li>
<li>celebrate children's progress over time.</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers are improvement-focused. They regularly engage in reflection and review. Strengthening the depth of analysis and the evaluative reporting should support the teaching team to more clearly measure the impact of their practices on children’s learning.</p><p>The board is well informed about outcomes from association-wide strategic reviews and the progress being made to achieve strategic goals.</p><p>The board and association are taking deliberate action to better support Māori, Pacific and children with diverse learning needs. The association have developed strong relationships with community organisations to support children and their whānau.</p><p>Appraisal is supporting growth in teacher capability. The association should update the performance management policy and the appraisal procedure. In addition, the association should now introduce the Teaching Council appraisal summary annual report as part of the endorsement process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>consult with parents and whānau Māori to determine what education success looks like for them and their children</li>
<li>enhance aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>strengthen internal evaluation practices.</li>
</ul><p>To improve practice the association should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review with urgency all policies that are not current.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Stoke Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>20 November 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
