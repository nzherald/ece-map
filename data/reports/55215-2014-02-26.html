</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Village Kids Childcare Havelock North is licensed to provide all day education and care for up to 50 children aged between two and five years. The service is one of three well established, privately owned centres operated by Village Kids in Hawke’s Bay. Many children and their families transition here from Village Kids Childcare Centre Te Mata Road which caters for up to two year olds.</p><p>A strong feature of this centre is stability of staffing that contributes sustained positive relationships with children and their families. Providing ongoing support for children with additional learning needs is highly evident.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of the three Village Kids early childhood centres. These centres are associated with the Village Kids home-based care network, after school care programmes and play groups.</p><p>Village Kids Childcare Havelock North has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy emphasises building trusting relationships between teachers, children and their families. Positive relationships encourage regular information sharing that support children’s learning and development. Children are free to learn through playing at their own pace. They benefit from a carefully considered learning environment and resources that support their interests. Attractive outdoor areas foster an interest in nature and encourage physical activity.</p><p>Responsive teaching enables children to have fun leading their learning. Staff support children to effectively self-manage and contribute to centre routines. Teachers identify children with additional learning requirements and proactively seek appropriate external agency help. Parents and families are partners in developing plans and strategies to assist children.</p><p>Profile folders contain attractively presented records of children’s learning in centre activities and group play. Teachers are beginning to improve their recording of how individual interests are extended over time, particularly in literacy and numeracy. Children take pride in revisiting learning and sharing this with others. A key next step is for staff to evaluate the effectiveness of assessment and planning practices in promoting children’s learning.</p><p>Children from other cultures are well known and affirmed through respectful teaching. The centre environment and resources reflect New Zealand’s bicultural heritage. Teachers are aware they are at early stages of using te reo Māori and more culturally responsive practices. Management and staff have identified further development of the bicultural programme as a key strategic goal for 2014.</p><p>Children’s transition to the centre and on to school is well-supported through strategies that respond to each child and their family readiness and preferences. Younger children’s age-specific needs are sensitively managed. Each child is well known as an individual and their learning is extended by teaching practices. Cooperative group play is strongly encouraged.</p><p>Self-review practices are developing well. Recent improvements in the transition-to-school process resulted from an in-depth review that included staff reflections, research and surveying key people. Teachers are becoming more confident in, and want to improve, their use of self review. Staff performance management and appraisal has progressed to include more useful goal setting and collection of evidence. This area continues to be an area for ongoing development.</p><p>Village Kids management and owners provide a robust policy and procedure framework for centre operations. Professional leadership is encouraged and head teachers model effective practices and encourage staff and children to lead. Teaching teams display high levels of professional and collaborative practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Management, staff and ERO agree on the following as key next steps:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop assessment, planning and evaluation of the effectiveness of teaching in extending individual learning</li>
<li>strengthen teacher use of te reo and culturally responsive practices to support Māori children's learning, as Māori</li>
<li>continue to develop, embed and extend the use of self review and staff appraisal for ongoing improvements in high quality education and care.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Village Kids Childcare Havelock North completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Village Kids Childcare Havelock North will be in three years.<img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>26 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
