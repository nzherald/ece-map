</table><p>Systems and processes for managing and leading the service need to be further developed and strengthened to ensure positive outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Twizel Early Learning Centre is a community-based early childhood service located beside the school in Twizel. It provides all-day education-and-care for up to 39 children. In response to community needs, the service now provides for up to 12 children under two years of age.</p><p>The service is governed by a board of dedicated parents. Since the last ERO review in 2013, there have been significant changes to management and leadership within the centre. The current head teacher was appointed in October 2015 and holds a fixed-term position until September 2016. An office administrator has been recently appointed to help with the business aspects of the service.</p><p>Most of the key areas for improvement in the last ERO report remain key areas for improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Board members show they have a good understanding of their roles and responsibilities as governors of the service. They meet regularly and have reviewed many aspects of the centre operations to ensure it continues to be viable and responsive to the needs of the Twizel community. They receive reports from the management team about the daily operations of the service. These reports would be more useful if they were evaluative rather than descriptive. The board has developed a strategic plan to guide the direction of the service but the plan needs strengthening. The board should ensure that planning over time:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>shows in more detail the actions and resources necessary to achieve the vison and associated goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is carefully monitored and documents the progress towards meeting the vision and goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>With ongoing changes to leadership within the centre, board members have identified that they need to grow the leadership and management capability. The board should develop planning to ensure that leadership growth is well supported, including planning for external support and ongoing professional development for service leaders.</p><p>In 2014 leaders had professional development to support self-review practice but with ongoing changes little of this learning was applied. Two teachers have very recently had professional development in this area but leaders identified that self review is in the early stages of implementation. The next step is for leaders and teachers to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further develop procedures to guide self review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure self review is guided by an evaluative question or focus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use indicators aligned to the review focus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitor the impact of the changes and report the findings to the board</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and implement a schedule for self review.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The procedures for teacher appraisal need strengthening to clearly state what is expected for teachers. For example, the procedures should reflect the expectations set by the Education Council. This includes gathering evidence to support the practising teacher criteria and observations of teaching practice.</p><p>In 2015 the teaching team redeveloped the centre philosophy. This could be strengthened by more clearly stating the desired outcomes for children in this centre. The team should then review how well the philosophy is evident in practice. The philosophy and policies state that leaders and teachers are committed to providing a bicultural curriculum. Teaching practice and the programme require further development to ensure this commitment is realised.</p><p>The team regularly undertakes spontaneous self review in response to emerging concerns. These reviews indicate that the curriculum for children aged two and over needs to be more responsive to individual and groups of children. There has to be a stronger focus on learning. Teachers need to further develop their understanding of how to implement Te Whāriki, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The new head teacher has been leading the development of planning, assessment and evaluation practices. This is still work in progress. The associated policies and procedures need to be strengthened to better guide teachers in their work. Records should show how teachers:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>use children’s interests and dispositions to foster learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>include children’s language, culture and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>show continuity of learning and progress over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>plan experiences and teaching strategies to support individual and group learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate the effectiveness of strategies and experiences in supporting the desired learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>There is a separate area for infants. Records show that teachers are responsive to the changing needs of babies and toddlers in this area. Teachers provide a range of experiences for this age group that support their language and social development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Board members and leaders need to address the areas for improvement identified within this report.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Twizel Early Learning Centre Inc completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Some systems and procedures need to be strengthened so that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the child protection policy allows for direct reporting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>policies and procedures are updated to include the Vulnerable Children's Act</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>written procedures are developed for guiding staff when police vetting signals a conviction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>medication and illness forms have parental acknowledgement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>risk-assessment and management plans for outings require more detail and ratios are included on the outings form.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Twizel Early Learning Centre Inc will be within two years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>26 July 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
