<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is an evaluation of the performance of the Timaru Kids Preschool governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the January 2013 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>strategic and annual planning</li>
<li>self review</li>
<li>curriculum theory and practice, including assessment, planning and resourcing.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Timaru Kids Preschool is one of two privately-owned and operated preschools in Timaru. The preschool provides education and care for children from 3 months to 6 years of age. The service&rsquo;s programme is based on the Montessori philosophy.</p><p>At the time of the review, there had been recent changes in staff. The owner and managers were in the process of restructuring and defining leadership roles and responsibilities. The supervising teacher had been appointed temporarily to fill a maternity-leave position and had been in the role for four months.</p><p>Many of the positive features identified in the January 2013 education review continue to be evident. These include the warm and caring relationships the teachers have with the children and the way children respect one another&rsquo;s work and cooperate in their play. The teaching team continues to take a professional approach to planning and the centre is well organised.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><h4>Strategic and annual planning</h4><p>A new manager was appointed at the preschool. She facilitated an analysis of the situation in the centre in relation to ERO's recommendations and led the team to develop some actions to ensure progress with improvements. Her focus has been on her role as manager and building effective organisational systems.</p><p>Research and consultation in the wider community has developed her understanding of strategic management and gained support in developing a centre strategic plan. Six strategic goals, based on the analysis, were gained with some ideas about how to achieve these.</p><p>A format and draft for an annual plan has been developed as an organisational tool to help with the management of the service. This is still a work in progress.</p><h4>Self review</h4><p>The manager, supervisor and teachers engage in a high level of reflective practice and are focused on improvement. The centre's philosophy has been revised to better reflect the teachers&rsquo; key beliefs and intentions. This is becoming more evident in what teachers do with children.</p><p>Self review has been ongoing with some changes resulting in positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Curriculum theory and practice, including assessment, planning and resourcing</p><p>Managers accessed external support to help build teachers&rsquo; understanding of the Montessori philosophy and to help identify ways to integrate Montessori ideas with <em>Te Wh&#257;riki,</em> the New&nbsp;Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum. Some Montessori resource kete were compiled consisting of age-appropriate activities for use at group times. Montessori training is underway for some teachers.</p><p>Good progress continues in developing systems for planning group experiences for children. This has been a key focus for the supervisor. She is monitoring the quality of the learning stories with a focus on improving assessment. There is evidence of programmes and teaching practices that respond to the learning requirements of children in the infant area and in building practical life skills for older children.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><h4>Strategic and annual planning</h4><p>The manager needs to strengthen the links between the centre vision, strategic goals, annual plan, and the centre philosophy and establish how progress will be monitored and evaluated.</p><h4>Self review</h4><p>The manager and teachers need to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen their understanding and use of self-review processes and practices and develop key indicators to review against when evaluating success</li>
<li>develop a schedule for self review that ensures a regular focus on aspects of teaching and learning and shows that all aspects of the centre's operation will be reviewed over time.</li>
</ul><p>Curriculum theory and practice, including assessment, planning and resourcing</p><p>The manager acknowledges the next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>ensure teachers make clear how they assess children&rsquo;s individual learning requirements and use this information when planning and implementing programmes and group activities</li>
<li>build on teachers' understanding of bicultural practices and plan ways to integrate M&#257;ori perspectives into programmes</li>
<li>continue to develop the curriculum and expectations for high quality teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><p>Currently programmes are mostly teacher directed and need to better reflect children&rsquo;s strengths, abilities and interests.</p><a id="3-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore, ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>15 May 2014</p><a id="information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Service</h2><table>
