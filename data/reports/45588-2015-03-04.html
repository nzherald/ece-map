</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Village Kids Home Based Care is a recently licensed home based education and care network operating in Hawke&rsquo;s Bay. The roll of 74 children includes 27 who are M&#257;ori and 18 less than two years of age. The service is one of two Village Kids home based care networks in Hawke&rsquo;s Bay. They are associated with three Village Kids early childhood centres, play groups and an after school care programme.</p><p>A director and management coordinator oversee service operations. Educarers work in their own homes to provide education and care for up to four children at any one time. Three qualified early childhood teachers are coordinators who visit homes and support educarer practice. The coordinator team are experienced in home based education and care and within Village Kids early childhood education services. The recently-created consultant role positively supports relationships with parents and wh&#257;nau when they enrol their children, by providing a central point of contact.</p><p>The &lsquo;PAUA&rsquo; philosophy guides expectations staff relating to participation, appreciation, taking responsibility and attentiveness to the needs of children and families.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of two Village Kids home-based education and care network reviews.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The service is well placed to promote positive and sustainable developments in education and care of children.</p><p>The curriculum is responsive to the needs, interests and strengths of children and their families. Parent and wh&#257;nau views inform the programme in homes and the community. Provisions for children up to two years support their care and wellbeing. A focus on investigating and exploring in outdoor environments and natural resources extend the learning experiences of infants and toddlers.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported through partnerships with external agencies. Inclusive practices are encouraged through carefully considered individual plans for children.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s cultural identities are valued and affirmed. Coordinators have sustained a focus on developing the confidence of staff and educarers to provide a bicultural curriculum.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation have become more responsive to children&rsquo;s needs and interests. Educarers are supported by coordinators to use assessment to respond to each child. Coordinators provide additional resources and ideas to extend children&rsquo;s thinking and enjoyment. Weekly playgroups and regular community excursions provide children with an extensive range of new experiences and social connections.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s individual profiles are attractive records of their learning and activities over time. Moving to online recording of children&rsquo;s learning provides future opportunities for parents and wh&#257;nau partnership to further enhance the quality of the curriculum.</p><p>The consultant and coordinators work closely with educarers to support each child&rsquo;s transition into homes and on to school. There are well considered processes to assist children and their families.</p><p>Managers and coordinators effectively support the growth and development of educarer teaching practice. New educarers participate in a thorough induction programme and ongoing professional development. They are encouraged to study for early childhood qualifications.</p><p>Coordinators records demonstrate how they work collaboratively, model expectations and teaching strategies with educarers. They provide regular exemplars of high quality assessment. They give ongoing constructive feedback during their monthly visits to educarers&rsquo; homes and in playgroups. Educarer learning and development programmes are well planned and personalised to their needs and those of the children in their care. They set monthly goals for improving teaching practice, complete journal reflections and collect regular evidence against educarer teacher criteria. Coordinators emphasise the importance of collecting evidence to review the effectiveness of teaching practice.</p><p>Recent governance and management restructuring has focused on strengthening the provision of high quality home based education and care for children. Consultation with families and educarers has contributed to a deliberate governance decision to focus on quality rather than network growth at this stage.</p><p>A newly-formed management committee assists collaboration and sharing of expertise across Village Kids services. Strategic planning clearly identifies appropriate key goals in relation to the service's vision. Systems for monitoring and sharing information are well developed. Roles and responsibilities expectations for educarers, coordinators and parents are clear.</p><p>The service has made very good progress in developing shared understanding and use of self review to inform ongoing improvements. The use of a wide range of evidence results in reviews that are responsive to parent and educarer ideas and wishes. As the result of an extended review, a new weekly music playgroup has been introduced to extend children&rsquo;s enjoyment of the programme. The management committee plans to further strengthen their reviews of the policy framework.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The management committee is currently reviewing how well the service PAUA philosophy is enacted in the home based education and care curriculum. Within this review, it is timely to consider how culturally responsive teaching and learning is supported and embedded.</p><p>Managers and coordinators identified that the coordinator appraisal process requires strengthening. The 2015 system should provide increased opportunities for more regular constructive feedback and more rigorous evaluation of personal and service goals. ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation supports this as a useful development.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Village Kids Home Based Care completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h3>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h3><p>The next ERO review of Village Kids Home Based Care will be in three years.<img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="index-html-m2a7690f7.gif"></p><p>Joyce Gebbie,</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central,</p><p>4 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
