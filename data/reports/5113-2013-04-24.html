<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Whiteacres Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Whiteacres Kindergarten is located in Pakuranga and operates under the Kindergarten Day Model with four fully qualified teachers. A new head teacher was appointed in 2012. The kindergarten has a history of positive ERO reports and was last reviewed by ERO in 2010. Since then, there have been major property developments and improvements to the kindergarten&rsquo;s internal and external environment. Teachers have sustained the good practices identified in the 2010 ERO report. They have engaged in professional development and continue to improve the quality of education provided. There continues to be a highly supportive parent group and good links with the local community.</p><p>Whiteacres Kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA). The association provides policy, procedural and operating guidelines. It also provides teachers with regular, topical professional development and on-going support from professional services managers.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers plan and implement a stimulating programme that is influenced by <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and incorporates bicultural practices. Their respect for child-initiated play, in particular creativity and exploration, is evident in the meaningful learning opportunities they offer to children. Teachers interact with children in supportive and affirming ways. Literacy, numeracy and science concepts are appropriately integrated throughout the programme.</p><p>Teachers are developing consistent and collaborative planning practices. These could be further strengthened by reviewing how effectively the progressions of children&rsquo;s individual interests are reflected in children&rsquo;s assessment portfolios and the programme.</p><p>Teachers provide an inclusive and welcoming environment in which children develop a strong sense of belonging. Play areas are well equipped, attractive and carefully presented. The large outside area offers many choices to support children&rsquo;s physical development and understanding of environmental sustainability. Teachers' skilful interactions and sustained conversations contribute to children being curious and eager to learn. Displays of past and current projects show children&rsquo;s involvement in the programme and provide good information for parents. Children share ideas, solve problems and make good choices.</p><p>Children are confident, busy learners. They play cooperatively and choose their own activities. They are supported by teachers to use Information Communication Technologies (ICT) for research, play and revisiting past experiences. Parents and wh&#257;nau participation is encouraged and their ideas are valued. Transitions into and out of the kindergarten are well supported. Good relationships underpin the centre&rsquo;s culture of trust and respect.</p><p>The kindergarten has a clear vision and strategic goals that closely link to the Association's strategic plan. Teachers are supported by AKA personnel and procedures. Appraisal promotes high quality practices and leadership opportunities. Teachers are enthusiastic about professional development. Efficient administration helps to ensure that the kindergarten operates smoothly and that the teachers&rsquo; focus remains on children&rsquo;s education.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teaching team identified self review as an area for ongoing development. They agree that they could increase the depth and breadth of perspectives of their self-review processes. Key next steps could include teachers:</p><ul>
<li>reviewing how the kindergarten philosophy is evident in their teaching practice</li>
<li>increasing the focus on M&#257;ori in centre reviews and further promoting M&#257;ori language culture and identity</li>
<li>increasing ways to foster a more child-led programme.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Whiteacres Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.Click here to enter text.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h4>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h4><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>24 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
