</table><p>Little Kiwi's Learning Centre has recently experienced significant change in management roles. The owner/team leader has an increased workload and is improving systems with external support to guide centre direction and teaching and learning. These developments are at an early stage of implementation.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Kiwi's Learning Centre is a privately-owned early childhood education and care facility. It is licensed to cater for up to 30 children aged over two years. Currently there are 10 Māori children on the roll. Since the June 2013 ERO report, aspects of the centre's outdoor play area have been redeveloped. Improvements have resulted in an enhanced environment for children.</p><p>The centre owners share financial and property-related aspects of service operations. Management of the day-to-day education and care is the responsibility of one owner whose role includes team leader of the teaching team.</p><p>The philosophy, values and beliefs promote a welcoming environment and encourage teachers to respond to children's strengths, capabilities and learning interests. It is timely to revisit the philosophy with this teaching team.</p><p>Since the previous ERO report managers and educators have made some progress in strengthening internal evaluation, assessment and planning and te reo me ngā tikanga Māori. These areas continue to require further refinement and development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are active, purposeful, busy learners engaging in, and motivated by, spontaneous and planned learning experiences. Teachers increasingly foster and encourage emerging interests, and support child-led inquiries and investigations.</p><p>Children play amicably with their peers. Attentive teachers respond promptly to children’s requests and play and work alongside them. They help with their developing abilities and skills that support them as capable, confident lifelong learners.</p><p>A positive tone is evident in the centre. Teachers are respectful and affirming in their relationships with children. The team leader and staff understand the importance of relationships. They work collaboratively to determine and responsively achieve parents' aspirations and expectations.</p><p>Narratives and photographs record children's engagement in the programme. Observations of their participation in individual and group experiences are reflected in portfolio books and a variety of visual displays within the centre. A recently introduced part of planning is the collection and sharing of assessment information with families through e-portfolios. This approach has the potential to extend children’s learning and further encourage parent contributions and communication.</p><p>Daily routines and programmes reflect the centre’s bicultural and multicultural community. Some te reo Māori is spoken by staff, and children recognise and use Māori words and phrases. Continuing to build teachers’ cultural awareness, knowledge and responsiveness is important as part of the ongoing integration of tikanga Māori in teaching and learning.</p><p>Children’s sense of belonging and wellbeing is effectively supported during and after transitions into the centre. The pre-school group requires review to ensure this programme is always relevant and responsive to children’s interests and not just adult-initiated ideas. Integrating early childhood approaches into the more structured times should enhance children's learning.</p><p>Provisionally certificated teachers do not receive appropriate mentoring from externally-based early childhood practitioners. Appraisal processes have yet to be implemented for all teaching staff. Management has identified these as immediate areas to address. ERO’s evaluation affirms this. Appraisal should be aligned to strategic intent and include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing appropriate leadership goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring opportunities for support and professional development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making use of <em>Tātaiako - Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners.</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Internal evaluation is in the early stages of development. The team leader and teachers use evidence systematically to review processes and practices and, to some extent, to reflect on the quality of teaching and learning. They continue to refine and develop various systems, policies and procedures. Strategic planning provides useful direction for centre operation and teaching and learning. Further consideration should be given to reviewing the desired objectives in the strategic plan and how these contribute to improving outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and managers should continue to seek external support to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop assessment, planning and evaluation practices that more effectively highlight individual children’s progress over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop teachers’ capacity for internal evaluation to promote inquiry into the impact of teaching practice on outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement robust systems and processes that build leaders’ and teachers’ capabilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build effective and sustainable governance and management practices that promote long-term, high quality education and care for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Kiwi's Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>To meet requirements, the service needs to improve its performance in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>fully implement a system of regular appraisal and ensure provisionally certificated teachers receive appropriate mentoring from externally-based early childhood practitioners.<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7.]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consults with the Ministry of Education and plans to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Kiwi's Learning Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>16 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><ul>
<li>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</li>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
