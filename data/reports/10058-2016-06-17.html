</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Next Generation Infant Care in Birkenhead provides education and care for children up to two years of age. This is one of three centres in Birkenhead owned and operated by the owner. Children from this centre often transition into the centre for children from two to five years of age.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 20 children and is operated and managed by an experienced and long serving management team, including the owner. Children attend at varying times and, some, for a variety of days. The centre is led by a supervisor. A newly formed management leadership team visit regularly and provide advice and guidance.</p><p>The philosophy for the centre has recently been reviewed and updated. It clearly expresses teachers' intentions for their teaching and relationships with children and their families. The document also comments about their growing understanding and knowledge of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Next Generation Infant Care has had a positive ERO reporting history.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Next Generation Infant Care continues to provide good quality education and care for young children. Teachers greet children and their parents warmly on arrival. They share news with parents about their children, fostering the close partnerships that are evident. Children confidently transition from parents to teachers. The shared care philosophy teachers follow works successfully to ensure children are trusting with all the adults in the centre. Children are settled and playful in the care of teachers.</p><p>The centre provides two indoor playing spaces and a generous and interesting outdoor playground. An upstairs room is designated for the younger babies who are not yet mobile, while the older children play in a more spacious area downstairs which leads directly to the outdoors. The younger children frequently visit downstairs with their teachers. These provisions provide good opportunities for children to make choices about their play and to enjoy each other's company.</p><p>Children make choices about where they want to play, making very good use of the newly shaded deck. Teachers provide resources and activities that successfully encourage children's exploration and interest. Children challenge themselves on thoughtfully placed balancing and climbing equipment.</p><p>Children's routines are well managed. The flow of the day is responsive to their needs and, for the younger babies, based on their home routines. Teachers place value on parent's aspirations for their children by striving to give them a sense of belonging and wellbeing. Teachers take the opportunity during hygiene processes to talk and sing to children, making these special one-to-one times. All of the children are responsive and cooperative, and indicate their affection for teachers.</p><p>The majority of the children are Pākehā, with small numbers from other cultures, including Māori. Teachers are aware of the need for their curriculum to reflect the bicultural heritage of New Zealand and do this well. They include words and phrases in te reo Māori in their conversations with children and sing waiata with and to them. The centre resources and decorations also indicate teachers' intentions to reflect both Māori and Pacifica cultures. Teachers use some words in children's home languages for those who are learning English as an additional language.</p><p>Teachers' assessment and planning processes are well established and provide effectively for children's development. They place a strong focus on children's dispositions as a guide for planning that helps to foster physical, emotional and social skills and abilities. Teachers provide a wide and varied curriculum. Evaluation of programmes is regular.</p><p>A particular focus in the programme is on talking to children. Teachers recognise that children need to hear a wide variety of spoken language in order to build vocabulary and confidence as communicators. Teachers are using Baby Sign language with children to help them to communicate.</p><p>Parents are informed regularly about their children's progress through learning stories in attractive and informative portfolios and on-line reporting. Teachers depend on daily face-to-face communication to give them greater awareness of children's health and happiness each day.</p><p>Teachers' teaching has undergone a significant, positive change towards reflective examination of the impact of their work on their own learning and on children's positive learning outcomes. New appraisal processes have generated this change and encouraged teachers to continue professional and open to learning. The increased focus on evidential files to meet the practicing teacher accreditation has also had an impact. Self-review processes are well established and add a further dimension to teachers' knowledge about the effectiveness of programmes.</p><p>Management of the centre, including personnel management, is well organised and efficient. Leadership is thoughtfully shared to take advantage of teachers' professional knowledge, skills and interests. Capacity building is becoming a strength of the service.</p><p>External professional development, including the leadership team as well as teachers, is creating a team culture of shared responsibility. The new appraisal processes, instigated last year, have a focus on professional practice and the identification of appropriate professional learning and development to further strengthen teachers' work with children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre management identified and ERO supports the following key next steps for the centre. These are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>effectively use the centre's ongoing self review process to strengthen communication ties to families, children and their team,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the bicultural focus on using te reo Māori and implementing appropriate protocols</p>
</li>
</ul><p>access professional learning and development that will enable teachers to stay current with good practices that have a positive impact on children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Next Generation Infant Care completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Next Generation Infant Care will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>17 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
