</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Naval Community Daycare – Calliope House caters for children over two years old and operates in conjunction with nearby Tamariki House which provides for babies and toddlers. The centres provide full day education and care for the children of staff at the Devonport Naval Base.</p><p>The centre is governed by a management committee which includes parents, naval officers and centre leaders. Its day to day operation is delegated to the head teacher and the administrator who report to the committee. Members are responsible for personnel matters and contribute to strategic planning and self review. They endorse the centre philosophy, which recognises the Treaty of Waitangi and fosters respect, partnerships with families and child initiated learning.</p><p>The centre has a high proportion of qualified teachers. They take leadership roles in the centre and regularly participate in professional learning opportunities. Teachers are developing their knowledge of Māori and many naturally integrate te reo Māori in their conversations with children. This practice particularly supports the large number of Māori children to feel a sense of belonging.</p><p>In 2011 ERO reported the positive progress made in the centre overcoming concerns that had been reported in the previous two years. Improvements had occurred in teaching and learning, planning, assessment and leadership. Leaders and teachers have continued improvements and have worked on areas for further development including self review, bicultural practices and behaviour management.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and confident in the centre. Many are articulate and enthusiastically engage in conversations. They have positive relationships with teachers and their peers, frequently playing in small social groups. Children confidently make choices about their play and they benefit from taking learning risks as part of their ‘courageous play’. Older children use early literacy and numeracy skills for meaningful purposes and often support younger ones as they learn together. Children have opportunities to develop self-management skills and show a sense of wellbeing and belonging in this environment.</p><p>Teachers consistently support children's play. They frequently work with small groups encouraging exploration of resources and social conversations. Teachers lead four age-related groups for short periods each day to foster appropriate learning experiences and support older children in their transition to school. Teachers particularly encourage children to extend their interests through ongoing project work. They could now consider how they could build further on children's skills and knowledge in their incidental play.</p><p>Teachers keep good records of children's experiences through learning stories, project books and a daily diary for parents. They constantly discuss the programme and ideas to supports children's interests but do not document plans to guide their work with children. Teachers could now be given leadership roles to promote different aspects of the curriculum. This delegation would enable them to become more deliberate in extending learning in areas such as maths, literacy, science and technology.</p><p>The centre provides an interesting learning environment. A new outdoor area enables flexible options for different age groups. Open-ended resources foster problem solving and courageous play.</p><p>Parents are enthusiastic about the centre. They appreciate the warm relationships their children share with teachers. Parents feel they are well informed about the programme and their child’s learning. They have good opportunities to contribute to decision making through the committee, questionnaires and parent meetings. They report that teachers respond positively to their aspirations and are sensitive to the needs of children who often deal with the long absence of a parent.</p><p>The committee and centre leaders responded positively to the last ERO report. They have established a comprehensive strategic plan that incorporates the centre values and vision. An annual plan guides the work of the committee and provides a timetable for regular policy review. An extensive appraisal process ensures teachers are assessed against the <em>Registered Teachers Criteria</em>. Some refinement could make this a more useful process for teachers. Centre leaders have considerably improved self-review processes and recent reviews of bicultural practices and ‘what makes a quality centre’ are resulting in positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and committee representatives agree that their next steps for development should include:</p><ul>
<li>formalising programme planning and strengthening evaluation and assessment practices</li>
<li>further developing learning extension and the centre’s responsiveness to Pacific cultures</li>
<li>reviewing the effectiveness and efficiency of the staff appraisal process</li>
<li>continuing to develop leadership roles for staff.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Naval Community Daycare - Calliope House completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Naval Community Daycare - Calliope House will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern Select Region</p><p>26 January 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
