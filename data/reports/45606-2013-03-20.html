<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Kiwi Kids Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. The service is developing its use of self review. Centre leaders are committed to continual improvement.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Kiwi Kids Early Learning Centre is located in the residential area of Onerahi, close to Whangarei city. The centre is privately owned and was opened in January 2011. It was purpose built for early childhood education and includes spacious indoor and outdoor environments.</p><p>The centre is organised into three areas to cater for children's developmental needs, and children are placed according to what best fits their physical, mental, social and emotional wellbeing. One area is primarily for children up to the age of 18 months, another for children aged between 18 months and three years of age, and one is for children from three to five years of age. The service offers full-day and sessional care.</p><p>The licensee and owner, who is an experienced ECE teacher, has made thoughtful staff appointments to ensure leaders and teachers have a range of skills and expertise. The centre serves a diverse community and includes a number of families from outside the immediate area. Low staff turnover helps to ensure continuity of care for children.</p><p>Teaching teams are well established and have a clear understanding of the philosophy of the centre. Centre leaders ensure teachers access a range of external and internal professional learning development opportunities.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well supported to develop as confident learners. They settle quickly and demonstrate a sense of belonging at the centre. Teachers encourage children to make decisions about their learning. They benefit from teachers who know them well. Children have positive, respectful relationships with each other and with their teachers, contributing to the calm centre atmosphere.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well provided for and benefit from flexible care routines that cater for their individual needs. Caring teachers have developed a good understanding of effective teaching practice for these learners. They make effective use of current theories and research to underpin their practice.</p><p>Older children benefit from teachers who promote communication and exploration. Learning environments and areas of play are well resourced. The focus on child-led learning supports children to initiate and sustain their play. Teachers respond to children's&rsquo; interests well and work collaboratively to engage them in purposeful learning. Children are also well guided in their social and emotional development and to take responsibility for their physical needs.</p><p>Teachers have developed good planning systems and provide useful documentation on children's learning. To improve outcomes for children teachers could now:</p><ul>
<li>increase their evaluation and documentation of children&rsquo;s learning to show progress over time</li>
<li>strengthen the role of the teacher in promoting complex learning</li>
<li>find more ways to integrate literacy and mathematics within play</li>
<li>review the appropriateness and success of the transition to school programme.</li>
</ul><p>Parents appreciate the open communication and welcoming environment. Centre leaders and teachers have established good relationships with families and wh&#257;nau. They are now looking for ways to collect more parent contributions and develop partnerships that further promote children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>M&#257;ori children are well known and valued. Teachers are developing their understanding and use of te reo M&#257;ori. They are committed to finding meaningful ways to better integrate te ao M&#257;ori into the programme. Strengthening partnerships with wh&#257;nau and building a centre p&#275;peha could help support leaders and teachers build stronger connections with the wider local community.</p><p>Children with special education needs are well catered for. Good links with external agencies and the inclusive centre culture ensures these children receive the care and support to help them succeed with their learning.</p><p>The centre is well led and effectively managed. Staff are guided by well established policies and procedure. Leaders consult with parents, wh&#257;nau and staff to make improvements. Ongoing review informs centre developments and is used to identify further areas for key consideration. Performance management and increasing teacher reflection remain key priorities for centre leaders. Inclusive leadership approaches support teachers to share in decision making.</p><p>Centre leaders have a good understanding of self review. To continue to improve outcomes for children and sustain good practice, centre leaders and ERO agree that next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>developing a strategic plan that includes goals, actions, timeframes, measurable indicators and key responsibilities</li>
<li>connecting annual plans with centre goals and targeted professional development</li>
<li>making positive outcomes for children more explicit in centre self reviews</li>
<li>aligning and documenting effective teaching approaches to the centre philosophy.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kiwi Kids Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>20 March 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
