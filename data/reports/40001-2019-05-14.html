</table><p>Kawerau Preschool Learning Centre (Incorporated) is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kawerau Preschool Learning Centre (Incorporated) is located in Kawerau situated alongside the Tarawera River and at the foot of Pūtauaki maunga. The centre is licensed for up to 55 children, including 18 aged up to two years. At the time of this ERO review the centre had a total roll of 58 children, including 31 of Māori descent.</p><p>The centre provides all-day education and care for children from six months to school-age. It operates two areas, the Kiwi room for infants and toddlers and the Kea room for young children. Tamariki move freely within these areas, exploring and following their interests.</p><p>Kawerau Preschool Learning Centre (Incorporated) is a community-based, not-for-profit, incorporated society. The governance committee consists of parents, the centre manager and community members.</p><p>The values and beliefs of whanaungatanga and relationships underpin the centre’s philosophy. This philosophy guides centre practices physically, emotionally and spiritually.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Relationships with whānau are focused on knowing children and their families well to better support learning. A strong focus on manaakitanga for children and their whānau is evident. A wide range of communication approaches gathers wellbeing and learning information about children and their whānau. Whānau participation in the life of the centre is actively encouraged. Positive interactions and nurturing relationships with children and whānau supports their sense of belonging and security.</p><p>Children are given time and encouraged to make choices to lead their own learning. A welcoming and caring environment is fostered for each child and their family. Teachers know the children and their families well. Respectful interactions are highly evident. Teachers work alongside children and support their play through conversations and sharing ideas. Children are confident to take risks and challenge themselves.</p><p>Responsive caregiving contributes to quality education and care for children up to the age of two. A genuine curriculum of care guides the personalised programme. Teachers are mindful of individual children’s non-verbal cues and preferences. The tailored environment promotes exploration, curiosity and risk taking. Purposeful resourcing is highly accessible to children. Calm and unhurried teaching interactions support children’s confidence and sense of security.</p><p>Teachers promote and provide opportunities to extend children’s oral language, numeracy and literacy skills. The teaching team are reflective and discuss strategies to enhance children's learning through play. Transition processes into, through and beyond the centre are well considered.</p><p>Meaningful hīkoi into the community extend children’s knowledge and promotes connections to the local environment. A wide range of experiences and opportunities supports a rich curriculum. Most teachers are using te reo and tikanga Māori throughout everyday conversations and interactions. Te ao Māori is purposefully woven throughout the localised programme and contributes to all children learning about Māori culture, language and whenua.</p><p>Learning portfolios reflect and celebrate individual children’s interests and strengths. The key values of whanaungatanga, kaitiakitanga, manaakitanga, and rangatiratanga, are reflected well in individual portfolios. Children’s choices are respected and their interests fostered through a wide range of provocations. Teachers are regularly discussing ideas, activities and events to engage children. It is timely to strengthen the shared understanding of effective assessment, planning and evaluation. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing clear expectations for teachers about high-quality assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly identifying and incorporating intended outcomes for children’s learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>documenting how teachers are adding depth and complexity to children’s learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embedding a consistent approach to enhance evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders give priority to equitable outcomes for children. Staff are actively encouraged to engage in relevant professional learning and development opportunities. Collaborative ways of working are fostered with the collegial teaching team. Leaders are extending their understanding and implementation of effective appraisal to guide improvements in teaching practice. A clear framework has been established to guide inquiry and internal evaluation. Embedding these recent developments, alongside building the shared knowledge and understanding of the revised childhood curriculum <em>Te Whāriki</em>, has been identified as a priority by the centre.</p><p>Parents and whānau are consulted and have opportunities to contribute to centre operation and self review. The governance committee receives detailed information to support decision making to enhance children's learning and engagement. Policies and procedures are regularly reviewed to effectively communicate expectations and inform practice. An action-focused strategic plan is in place that focuses on improving outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To support and build ongoing improvements the key next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen teachers' understanding of effective assessment, planning and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop and embed effective appraisal for improving teacher practice</p>
</li>
<li>develop a shared understanding of <em>Te Whāriki</em> to ensure it is fully implemented in the centre<em>.</em></li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kawerau Preschool Learning Centre (Incorporated) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>14 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
