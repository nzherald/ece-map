</table><p align="center" style="text-align: left;">Amber Early Learning Centre is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Amber Early Learning Centre is a privately-owned centre located in Tauranga, licensed for 45 children. It offers full-day education and care for children from birth to school age in three age-based rooms. At the time of this ERO review 42 children were enrolled, including 21 who identify as Indian. One of the centre owners is early childhood qualified. She provides professional leadership and guidance to the onsite team leader, who manages the day-to-day running of the centre and supports the teaching team.</p><p>The centre's philosophy focuses on respecting children’s individuality and enhancing their self-esteem and confidence. An holistic approach aims to nurture and empower children’s physical, cognitive, social and emotional wellbeing, through a play-based programme. Children are encouraged to develop a sense of wonder, curiosity, connection and discovery through exploration in authentic and meaningful contexts for learning. The individual cultural heritage of each child and their family is acknowledged and valued.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2016 a new team leader has been appointed and there have been some changes to the teaching team. There has been a significant upgrade to the outdoor learning environment. The centre has a positive ERO reporting history and has responded very well to the areas identified in the previous report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre's curriculum is highly inclusive and responsive. Language, culture and identities of Māori and other diverse groups are strongly valued and visible in the centre. Kaupapa Māori concepts are well embedded in centre planning and documentation. High-quality comprehensive planning and assessment practices are clearly aligned to <em>Te Whāriki</em> and explicitly acknowledge children’s strengths, interests, dispositions and next learning steps. Children with additional learning needs are well identified and catered for through individualised planning and external support. Learning is enriched through a range of well-planned authentic contexts, including special centre events and trips into the local community. Children grow in confidence and capability while experiencing a strong sense of belonging and connectedness to their cultural heritage.</p><p>Teachers use very effective strategies to enhance learning. Warm and affirming relationships contribute to calm and settled environments for learning. Children are well supported to develop social and emotional competence, and tuakana teina interactions are fostered. The provision of multilingual teachers supports learning and communication for children and their families who are from non-English speaking backgrounds. Attractive and well-resourced environments with deliberate provocations promote high levels of engagement and self-directed learning. Effective integration of literacy, mathematics and oral language in meaningful contexts supports and scaffolds learning. Personalised communication with parents, families, whānau and responsive transitions contribute to success for children.</p><p>Children up to the age of two benefit from very caring and respectful interactions and practices. Their individual needs and routines are well met. Children are actively encouraged to exercise choice, play and explore in a calm and nurturing environment. Teachers skilfully respond to non-verbal cues, focus on oral language development and extend meaningful learning opportunities.</p><p>Effective professional leadership builds collective capacity to improve outcomes for children. Well-documented guidelines and shared understandings about all aspects of teaching and learning, promote consistency of practice. A positive team culture with high levels of relational trust enables the team to uphold the centre’s vision and philosophy. Leadership is highly focused on improving the quality of education and care through systematic self review and internal evaluation that is clearly linked to readings and research. A strategic centre-wide focus on strengthening culturally responsive practices informs changes to teaching practices and improved outcomes for children.</p><p>The owners provide effective governance for the centre. They have positive and reciprocal relationships with the team leader and together they ensure the successful running of the centre. Strong systems and processes guide all operations including policy, financial, and health and safety management. A clear vision and philosophy reflect a commitment to cultural diversity. Internal evaluation is highly responsive to identified priorities and improving outcomes for children. Robust teacher appraisal documentation is well aligned to centre strategic planning and Teaching Council of New Zealand requirements. Resourcing of professional learning and development opportunities supports building teacher and leadership capability. Governance prioritises decision making and resourcing to support families and enable equitable opportunities for children to learn.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To build on the existing positive centre practices, leaders and teachers should consider ways to streamline the planning, assessment and evaluation cycle. This is necessary to further support positive partnerships for learning and promote sustainable practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Amber Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Darcy Te Hau<br>Acting Director Review and Improvement Services<br>Central Region - Te Tai Pūtahi Nui</p><p>25 February 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
