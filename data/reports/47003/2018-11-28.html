</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mt Wellies Childcare is a family owned and operated centre located in Mt Wellington. The purpose-built centre is licensed for 90 children from three months to school age, including up to 30 children under two years of age. It offers full day education and care, operating from 7am to 6pm. The culturally diverse teaching team reflects the diversity of the families that attend the centre.</p><p>Children are catered for in three age-related rooms, each with ready access to outdoor areas. Children from the infants' room transition to the toddlers' room at approximately two years of age, and then to the preschool group at about three-and-a-half years of age.</p><p>The director recently appointed a new manager and a professional learning and development (PLD) leader to ensure high expectations are being met by the centre. They work closely with the director. The centre manager is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the centre and is supported by a head teacher in each room. The three head teachers are newly appointed to their positions.</p><p>Mt Wellies Childcare's vision is to encourage children to become explorers of their own learning in a well-resourced, supportive learning environment that promotes and sustains positive relationships. Children develop dispositions to help them become competent and confident learners. The vision recognises the importance of strong relationships with family/whānau and the community.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of this centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from a caring environment that promotes their wellbeing and sense of belonging. They experience positive relationships with adults and show respect for one another. Children engage in conversations with teachers that foster valued outcomes including language development, social skills, early literacy and numeracy skills and knowledge.</p><p>Babies and toddlers are well catered for in a calm, emotionally secure environment. Care routines are used as language learning opportunities. Independence and self-help are encouraged. Children can independently access age-appropriate resources.</p><p>Communication between parents and teachers is well managed. Babies are assigned a primary caregiver who carries out most of their care routines and liaises with the parents and the other staff members. Teachers communicate well with parents to ensure home routines are continued for babies.</p><p>In the other rooms a key teacher is assigned to each child. The key teacher takes the overall responsibility for the assessment and planning of that child and is often the first point of contact for parents.</p><p>Teachers have strengthened processes for assessing children's learning and curriculum planning. They discuss with parents, goals and aspirations for their child's learning to inform planning for individuals. Electronic portfolios help teachers and parents share information about children's development and encourage parents to contribute to planning. Printed copies are easily available to children.</p><p>The centre is generously staffed. The building is well designed and appropriately resourced to promote learning and encourage children to be active learners. Resources are well organised and presented to children in ways that promote curiosity and exploration. There is physical challenge in the outdoor environment.</p><p>Transitions into, within, and on to school are well managed and support children's emotional wellbeing. Teachers are flexible in the time available for children and their parents to make the transitions.</p><p>The centre is ably led by the director and centre manager. Effective evaluation of centre operations has identified appropriate goals that form the basis of a well-considered strategic plan. This plan will enable the centre manager to report progress towards meeting the intended outcomes for the centre.</p><p>The director demonstrates a commitment to supporting the language, culture and identity of Māori and Pacific children and their families. Some strategies are already in place. She could consider including other related and identified strategies into the centre's strategic plan to support ongoing development in these areas.</p><p>A comprehensive policy framework is in place, and policy review is regular, with input from staff and families/whānau. There are good systems to guide and monitor aspects of health and safety and ensure that requirements are met.</p><p>Effective strategies support teachers to improve their professional practice. A new appraisal system has been introduced to promote teachers' self-reflection and improve professional practice. The PLD leader has sound pedagogical knowledge to guide improvements in teaching and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leadership team agrees to continue building staff capability by fully implementing the improved appraisal process and accessing relevant professional learning and development. Areas identified as key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening the use of strategies that promote success for Māori and Pacific learners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encouraging all staff to engage in professional dialogue that supports children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building staff capability to reflect on their practices and conduct internal evaluation that improves positive outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mt Wellies Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mt Wellies Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>28 November 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
