</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidzone Public Servants Childcare Centre is a not-for-profit, parent community-based early learning service located in Newtown, Wellington. It is licensed to provide all day education and care for 25 children, including eight aged up to two years. The centre serves a culturally diverse community.</p><p>A group of parent volunteers is responsible for the overall governance of the centre. Each member has clearly defined roles and responsibilities. They work in collaboration with the centre supervisor, who is responsible for day-to-day operation. All teachers are fully qualified and registered.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises the importance of children learning through play and being assisted to grow as competent, confident learners and communicators. The February 2015 ERO report identified the need to strengthen assessment for learning, the bicultural curriculum and self review. These areas continue to require development.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Building and maintaining positive relationships with children and their parents continues to be a priority. Parents' views are sought and valued and contribute to decisions made about the operation of the centre and aspects of children's learning. A well-established process is in place for supporting children and their families to transition to school.</p><p>Teachers are caring. They work collaboratively to settle children into the routines of the day and promote their participation in activities. The centre is suitably resourced to meet a range of interests and learning experiences. Children co-operate with each other and play happily together.</p><p>Much effort goes into planning activities and documenting centre happenings. The curriculum should be further developed to respond to children's strengths, interests and emerging ideas. Consideration should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>providing increased opportunities for children to make choices about their participation and lead their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing children's access to learning materials and areas for play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing creative, open-ended learning opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that core learning areas are integrated into the programme in authentic, play-based ways</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maximising opportunities for one-to-one engagement between teachers and children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The supervisor agrees that teachers need to refocus as a team on the development and implementation of the learning programme. Next steps are to: increase the emphasis on noticing, recognising and responding to children's interests and strengths; and make visible the strategies to progress children's learning. Group and individual planning should be aligned to desired learning outcomes, to better support the evaluation of plans and inform decisions about next development steps.</p><p>Leadership for teaching and learning requires strengthening to more effectively promote the outcomes referred to in guiding documents and for ongoing improvement to outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers should continue to inquire into the effectiveness of the strategies they are using to promote individual's learning, in line with their philosophy, values and the intent of <em>Te Whāriki</em>.</p><p>Toddlers are cared for by staff who know them well. However, support for these young children's learning requires development. A stronger focus on identifying and responding to their needs should be implemented. This should include ongoing communication and engagement that recognises their competence as learners.</p><p>Teachers are inclusive in their practice and celebrate the diversity of the community. They prioritise the integration of cultural activities into the programme. There has been ongoing development of a bicultural programme through resourcing and time dedicated for teachers to focus on te reo Māori. One of the teachers leads children and staff in developing their knowledge of Samoan culture and language, speaking to the Samoan children in their language.</p><p>Parents are well-informed about centre activities. Progress reports are regularly shared with parents in children's profile books, and through parent/teacher interviews, displays and newsletters.</p><p>Comprehensive, well-documented planning guides the centre's strategic direction and operation. A focus on ongoing improvement is documented.</p><p>The appraisal process includes teacher reflection and appropriate feedback about their practice. An effective process for mentoring teachers working towards full certification is evident. Changes are needed to the appraisal policy and processes to reflect the Standards for the Teaching Profession.</p><p>The supervisor and teachers reflect on their processes and practices and make changes for improvement. Policies are regularly reviewed by the governance group. Further development of the current review process to strengthen collaborative sense making and evaluation with increased emphasis on outcomes for children, is a next step.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO's evaluation has found that next steps for development are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further develop the curriculum, including the programme for toddlers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen internal evaluation to support continuous improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidzone Public Servants Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to curriculum responsiveness. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following area:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the service curriculum is informed by assessment, planning, and evaluation (documented and undocumented) that demonstrates an understanding of children's learning and their interests. <em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008]</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidzone Public Servants Childcare Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>5 March 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
