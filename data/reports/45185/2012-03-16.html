<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Topkids Motutaiko Toddlers and Preschool is located in the central North Island town of Taupo and provides education and care for children from two years to school age. The centre opened in August 2009. It is owned by Kidicorp Ltd and benefits from their professional services and support personnel. The centre operates alongside another licence, in the same building, that caters for infants and toddlers. This is the first ERO review of the centre.</p><p align="left">The centre is licensed for 43 children over the age of two. At the time of the ERO review there were 51 children enrolled, including 19 M&#257;ori children.</p><p align="left">Centre leaders have worked collegially to develop a clear strategic direction for the centre that strongly reflects their philosophy of working in a partnership with families for the benefit of children. Effective self-review processes contribute to the sustainability and development of the centre.</p><p align="left">Teachers know children and families well and have established a positive, welcoming environment, where parent participation is valued and encouraged. The centre is inclusive and caters for the needs of children identified with special needs, and their families. Children are able to take increasing responsibility for their own learning and care.</p><p align="left">ERO and centre leaders agree that important areas for ongoing development include: rationalising management roles, and enhancing programme planning and aspects of the learning environment.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Topkids Motutaiko Toddlers was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atTopkids Motutaiko Toddlers .</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Since the centre opened in 2009, managers and staff at Topkids Motutaiko Toddlers &amp; Preschool have worked towards establishing a clear philosophy about learning, which is focused on teachers and families working together for the benefit of children. At the time of the review the centre manager of the two age-based licences was also the head teacher. During 2011, whole-staff professional development with a focus on literacy was undertaken. This training included working with another local early childhood service. As a result of self review, the centre is undertaking a major redevelopment of the outdoor environment.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left"><b>Leadership:</b> The centre manager has worked cooperatively with staff and Kidicorp Ltd personnel to provide clear direction for centre development. She provides a good model of teaching practice for teachers. In a relatively short time, this leadership team has developed strong and trusting relationships with children, families and wh&#257;nau. Clearly documented guidelines and expectations guide all aspects of centre operations. Experienced business and professional services managers provide valuable support for centre management. Together with the centre manager, they have established a systematic approach to self review, an appropriate appraisal process and regular, relevant professional development for staff.</p><p align="left"><b>Relationships:</b> Teachers have established a positive, welcoming environment where parents&rsquo; participation is valued and encouraged. The strong team culture values individual strengths and supports staff in extending their range of skills and expertise. Children are respected and affirmed, their culture valued and their strengths and interests identified. There is a strong emphasis on developing children&rsquo;s growing social and emotional competence.</p><p align="left"><b>Interactions:</b> Teachers model appropriate behaviours and make good use of positive behaviour management strategies. ERO observed examples of good teaching strategies including:</p><ul>
<li>open-ended questioning and learning conversations that extended children&rsquo;s thinking and language skills;</li>
<li>teachers engaging in play alongside children; and</li>
<li>educators responding promptly to children.</li>
</ul><p align="left"><b>Programme:</b> Features of the learning programme include:</p><ul>
<li>children&rsquo;s emerging interests being recognised;</li>
<li>flexible routines that allow for sustained individual and small-group play;</li>
<li>effective use of computers for research and extending learning;</li>
<li>bicultural perspectives, through some use of tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori, and centre displays;</li>
<li>opportunities to learn to care for a range of pets; and</li>
<li>trips and excursions, designed to extend children&rsquo;s knowledge of the wider world.</li>
</ul><h4>Agreed priorities for development and review</h4><p align="left">Centre management have identified, and ERO agrees that, important priorities for ongoing review include:</p><ul>
<li>rationalising senior leadership, with a view to separating and strengthening the roles of professional leader and administrative manager;</li>
<li>enhancing programme planning to ensure that children experience increasing complexity and challenge; and</li>
<li>ensuring that the learning environment, equipment and materials consistently provide the range of experiences and opportunities necessary to support the curriculum and children&rsquo;s developing learning dispositions.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Topkids Motutaiko Toddlers completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

The centre opened in August 2009. It is owned by Kidicorp Ltd and benefits from their professional services and support personnel. The centre operates alongside another licence, in the same building, that caters for infants and toddlers. This is the first ERO review of the centre.</p><p align="left">The centre is licensed for 43 children over the age of two. At the time of the ERO review there were 51 children enrolled, including 19 M&#257;ori children.</p><p align="left">Centre leaders have worked collegially to develop a clear strategic direction for the centre that strongly reflects their philosophy of working in a partnership with families for the benefit of children. Effective self-review processes contribute to the sustainability and development of the centre.</p><p align="left">Teachers know children and families well and have established a positive, welcoming environment, where parent participation is valued and encouraged. The centre is inclusive and caters for the needs of children identified with special needs, and their families. Children are able to take increasing responsibility for their own learning and care.</p><p align="left">ERO and centre leaders agree that important areas for ongoing development include: rationalising management roles, and enhancing programme planning and aspects of the learning environment.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p></html>
