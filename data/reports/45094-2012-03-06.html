<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2>
<p>Te Whare Totara has been operating since July 2009 and this is the first ERO review for the centre. This early childhood education and care centre is privately owned and located in Whakatane. The centre caters for children over the age of 2 years and provides bilingual education within the framework of Te Wh&#257;riki, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum and the Montessori approach to learning.</p>
<p>At the time of this review 24 children were enrolled, most of whom identify as being of M&#257;ori descent. There is a shared understanding among centre staff and wh&#257;nau about the centre&rsquo;s aims and philosophy. Positive partnerships and whanaungatanga contribute to collaboration, reciprocal relationships and high-quality education and care for tamariki.</p>
<p>Children are happy and confident to make choices about their play and learning with support and encouragement from highly skilled teachers. Features of interactions, the environment and programme that effectively promote children&rsquo;s learning include:</p>
<ul><li>extensive opportunities to gain foundation skills and concepts relating to literacy, mathematics, science, technology and the wider world;</li>
<li>the opportunity to learn te reo M&#257;ori and other languages, and gain an appreciation of other cultures and world views;</li>
<li>fostering considerate and respectful relationships, and a sense of responsibility for self, others and the environment;</li>
<li>promotion of inclusive behaviours, and responsive practices that contribute to children&rsquo;s health and safety;</li>
<li>assessment practices that enable teachers to make timely responses to individual children&rsquo;s readiness for the next stage of learning; and</li>
<li>a vibrant environment that motivates children&rsquo;s interests, contribution and participation in complex learning.</li>
</ul><p>Since opening, the centre has made significant progress. Further development of assessment practice, and continued enrichment of te Ao M&#257;ori within the context of Montessori education in Aotearoa/New Zealand, should more fully realise the aims and aspirations of the centre&rsquo;s mission statement and philosophy.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Te Whare Totara was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atTe Whare Totara.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>This is the first ERO review of Te Whare Totara. The centre is privately owned and opened in July 2009. There are a number of teachers who have both New Zealand early childhood teaching qualifications and Montessori teaching qualifications. The centre&rsquo;s mission statement and guiding principles express aspirations that aim to provide:</p>
<ul><li>an environment that is supportive, responsive and challenging;</li>
<li>a unique experience of bilingual learning;</li>
<li>opportunities for the &lsquo;genius&rsquo; in each child to be explored. &lsquo;Children are guided at their own pace through a range of learning skills and experiences so they do what they love and love what they do&rsquo;; and</li>
<li>a Montessori approach where children direct the learning in a structured and well-resourced environment. Areas include, practical life, sensorial, language, mathematics, geography, science, art and music.</li>
</ul><p>This review evaluates the centre&rsquo;s progress since opening, and the influence of its expressed aims on the quality of education provided for children, and responsiveness to families.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>Philosophy in action: The centre owner has a clear vision and provides effective leadership for centre direction. She has formed positive partnerships with teachers and wh&#257;nau, who have a shared understanding about the centre&rsquo;s aims and philosophy. Together they have established an informed and collaborative learning community that reflects the concept of whanaungatanga and provides high-quality education and care for tamariki.</p>
<p>Programme: Highly perceptive teachers notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s interests, strengths and learning. Children confidently make choices and direct their own play and learning. Effective assessment, planning and evaluation practices enable teachers to act in response to children&rsquo;s readiness for next learning steps within the Montessori curriculum. Aspects of children&rsquo;s learning are well documented by teachers and children in individual profiles. Features of the programme include:</p>
<ul><li>a skilled kaiako who speaks fluent te reo M&#257;ori with children and adults;</li>
<li>children&rsquo;s involvement in decisions and contributions to the everyday tasks of the centre;</li>
<li>extensive opportunities for children to gain foundation skills and concepts for literacy, science, mathematics, technology and the wider world;</li>
<li>creative expression through the arts; and</li>
<li>a strong emphasis on the gifts of papatuanuku, the living world, everyday life skills, health and well-being.</li>
</ul><p>Interactions: Adults have high expectations for children&rsquo;s competence and capability. They skilfully model and promote considerate and respectful relationships. Teachers hold in-depth learning conversations to extend children&rsquo;s thinking and problem-solving skills. They trust children, encourage risk taking and foster independence and resilience. Children demonstrate high levels of enjoyment, self responsibility and cultural connection.</p>
<p>Environment: Children are welcomed in to a deliberately planned, well-presented and resourced learning environment. This home-like setting is designed to engage children in meaningful activities such as food preparation, gardening and animal care. This ever-evolving and vibrant environment invites children&rsquo;s curiosity, exploration and experimentation. High-quality, specialist equipment and resources engage and sustain children&rsquo;s interest in complex learning for long periods of time.</p>
<h4>Agreed priorities for development and review</h4>
<p>The centre owner has identified and ERO agrees that an important consideration for this new centre is to continue to enrich and embed te ao M&#257;ori within the context of Montessori education in Aotearoa/New Zealand.</p>
<p>In addition, children&rsquo;s assessment portfolios could be further enhanced through:</p>
<ul><li>developing a shared understanding and consistent practice among staff about profiles as tools for assessment; and</li>
<li>greater inclusion of parent voice in setting goals and sharing aspirations to strengthen their role as partners in the ongoing learning process.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3>
<p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul><li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs;</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners; and</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4>
<p>There have been no children who have been identified with moderate to severe special needs prior to enrolment. However, through their observation, teachers have identified several children with special learning needs and have made referrals to the appropriate specialist services.</p>
<h4>Area of strength</h4>
<p>Inclusion: The centre offers a highly inclusive service in a home-like setting. The centre philosophy promotes the concept of whanaungatanga and places high value on the &lsquo;genius&rsquo; within every child. Teachers are experienced and engage in focused professional development in order to meet individual children&rsquo;s needs. The Montessori approach emphasises the importance of child-led learning at their own pace. Teachers are highly responsive and skilled at recognising and responding to children&rsquo;s readiness for specific next learning steps. These aspects place the centre in a good position to cater for children with moderate to severe special needs.</p>
<a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Te Whare Totara completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve current practice the centre owner should:</p>
<ul><li>review the placement of some heavy items of equipment to maximise the safety of children and adults in the event of an earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>

<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-te-whare-totara" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Te Whare Totara</h2>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Te Whare Totara.</p>
<p>Te Whare Totara has been operating since July 2009 and this is the first ERO review for the centre. This early childhood education and care centre is privately owned and located in Whakatane. The centre caters for children over the age of 2 years and provides bilingual education within the framework of Te Wh&#257;riki, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum and the Montessori approach to learning.</p>
<p>At the time of this review 24 children were enrolled, most of whom identify as being of M&#257;ori descent. There is a shared understanding among centre staff and wh&#257;nau about the centre&rsquo;s aims and philosophy. Positive partnerships and whanaungatanga contribute to collaboration, reciprocal relationships and high-quality education and care for tamariki.</p>
<p>Children are happy and confident to make choices about their play and learning with support and encouragement from highly skilled teachers. Features of interactions, the environment and programme that effectively promote children&rsquo;s learning include:</p>
<ul><li>extensive opportunities to gain foundation skills and concepts relating to literacy, mathematics, science, technology and the wider world;</li>
<li>the opportunity to learn te reo M&#257;ori and other languages, and gain an appreciation of other cultures and world views;</li>
<li>fostering considerate and respectful relationships, and a sense of responsibility for self, others and the environment;</li>
<li>promotion of inclusive behaviours, and responsive practices that contribute to children&rsquo;s health and safety;</li>
<li>assessment practices that enable teachers to make timely responses to individual children&rsquo;s readiness for the next stage of learning; and</li>
<li>a vibrant environment that motivates children&rsquo;s interests, contribution and participation in complex learning.</li>
</ul><p>Since opening, the centre has made significant progress. Further development of assessment practice, and continued enrichment of te Ao M&#257;ori within the context of Montessori education in Aotearoa/New Zealand, should more fully realise the aims and aspirations of the centre&rsquo;s mission statement and philosophy.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>
