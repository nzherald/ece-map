</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Island Bay Childcare is a privately-owned centre. It is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 56 children, including 21 up to the age of two years. Of the 71 enrolled, one child identifies as Māori. The centre is purpose built with separate playrooms for infants and toddlers and the older children.</p><p>The leadership team comprises of the centre manager, two team leaders and an external consultant. Some staffing changes have occurred since ERO's October 2013 review.</p><p>The October 2013 ERO report identified that significant improvement was needed, particularly in relation to developing shared expectations of effective early childhood teaching and learning. Key next steps included: improving the quality of teaching and respectful interactions; responding to children’s culture, language and identity; strengthening the appraisal process; and reviewing the transition to school programme.</p><p>Leaders, with regular Ministry of Education monitoring, have worked with centre staff to address the areas in need of improvement. A wide range of professional development has been accessed to address these areas of concern.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders and the teaching team have made good progress in developing shared expectations for high quality early childhood practice. They have participated in a range of professional learning and development to further their understanding of teaching and learning, children’s culture, language and identity and the appraisal process.</p><p>The philosophy promotes a child-centred focus in the curriculum, partnerships with parents and respect for Te Tiriti o Waitangi. This approach is evident in practice. Leaders have developed indicators that make clear the quality teaching practices that enable the philosophy to be realised. Further work is required to include a stronger focus on the role of the teacher in adding complexity to children’s learning. This would strengthen these indicators.</p><p>Teachers know children well. They are warm and welcoming to them and their families. They work alongside children, engaging in their conversations and offering choices in their learning and help children relate to others in positive ways. Although some progress is evident in the quality of interactions teachers use with children, continued development is required. A key next step for leaders, in partnership with teachers, is to define what quality interactions are, so that expectations for practice are clear. These can then be used more successfully to target observations of teachers' practice for appraisal and self review.</p><p>Leaders have been responsive to building bicultural practice in the centre. A bicultural perspective is evident through the environment and aspects of the curriculum. Teachers integrate te reo me ngā tikānga Māori throughout the programme. <em>Tataiako</em>: <em>Cultural competences for teachers of Māori learners</em> has been explored in-depth in relation to teachers’ professional practice. Children’s culture, language and identity is affirmed and celebrated through the centre curriculum and assessment information.</p><p>Children’s profiles highlight their involvement in centre activities. Partnership with parents is actively promoted through regular communication and involvement in their child’s programme. Assessment documentation requires development to clearly identify the learning and show how teachers add complexity, extend learning and show progress over time.</p><p>Group planning provides a shared focus for the programme. Clearer learning outcomes should assist teachers to evaluate the impact of the curriculum on children’s learning.</p><p>Self review and internal evaluation have resulted in improvements to practice. A clear and well-analysed process is in place. To strengthen internal evaluation capability, leaders should support teachers to shift from reviewing what they do, to evaluating how well practices support children's learning.</p><p>Transition to school has been a recent self-review focus. Leaders and teachers reflected on current research and have sought multiple perspectives through this process. Improvements have been made to practice to better support children's preparation for school.</p><p>Regular appraisals are undertaken. Although some progress is evident, further work is required to strengthen the quality of the documentation. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>developing a clear appraisal procedure</li>
<li>use of formal observations to inform professional practice conversations</li>
<li>teachers identifying clear, specific and measurable goals</li>
<li>reflecting the additional responsibilities of the designated role through the appraisal.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre management and leaders should continue to focus on strengthening practice to improve outcomes for children. Next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>identifying the role of the teacher in adding complexity to children’s learning and reflect this through the philosophy</li>
<li>making explicit centre expectations regarding quality interactions between teachers and children</li>
<li>strengthening the analysis of children’s learning and planning accordingly</li>
<li>building the evaluation capacity of teachers</li>
<li>establishing a clear appraisal procedure and improving documentation of the process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Island Bay Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Island Bay Childcare will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>25 November 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
