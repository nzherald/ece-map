</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Learning Curves Early Childhood Education Centre is located in Morrinsville. It is a privately owned centre that provides full-day education and care for infants and children until they are ready for school. The centre is licensed for 50 children, including up to 15 aged under two. Fifteen of the 67 children currently enrolled are identified as Māori. The owner manages the centre and maintains regular contact with children and teachers. Two head teachers are responsible for the daily programmes in the separate infants/toddlers and older children’s play areas. Staffing is stable and there is a strong emphasis on employing and retaining qualified and registered teachers.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy is to maintain a community of learners that incorporates children, families, teachers and the wider community. Parents are recognised as the primary educators of their children and teachers aim to provide a programme that combines child-led and teacher-guided activities based on children’s interests. Bicultural perspectives are recognised and valued.</p><p>The 2010 ERO review identified many areas of good performance, including a high-quality responsive programme for infants and toddlers. An interesting, varied programme for older children effectively integrated literacy and mathematics within meaningful contexts. Across the centre, interactions between teachers and children demonstrated respectful affirming relationships and sustained conversations that enriched children’s learning. The well-designed indoor and outdoor areas were resourced to promote independent and social play. Parents and whānau were well informed about the care and education of their children. A strong sense of well being and belonging was evident in a safe and settled environment.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO review, the centre manager has continued to emphasise the development of bicultural understanding and awareness and many other areas of centre operation have been reviewed and further developed. The recent purchase of adjacent land is planned to enhance the already spacious and inviting outdoor play area.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>This review finds that the positive features identified in the 2010 ERO review have been sustained. Learning opportunities have been enhanced by a focus on the use of computers as tools for investigation and learning, and increasing the integration of Māori culture and language. There are many opportunities for physical challenge, gardening and developing environmental awareness.</p><p>Teachers continue to respond respectfully to children’s interests and requests. Social skills are developed through in-depth conversations. Open questioning facilitates problem solving and encourages children to share and extend their ideas. Early literacy, mathematics and science concepts are spontaneously integrated within the programme. The stimulating and attractive environment includes well-considered resources targeted to engage children in exploration and learning. High-quality assessment involves parents as partners in children’s learning. A family-like atmosphere fosters confidence and a sense of belonging. Children are settled and purposefully engaged in a variety of interesting learning and play experiences.</p><p>Infants and toddlers benefit from nurturing, respectful relationships in a warm and caring atmosphere where teachers know and understand them well. Transition to the older children’s area is sensitively managed with respect for children’s individual needs. In the older children’s area, an effective, but optional, preschool group programme affords opportunities for the centre manager to unobtrusively assess and foster children’s skills and concepts that will ease their transition to school.</p><p>The experienced centre manager and senior teachers model effective teaching practices. They promote a collaborative staff culture based on continual professional reading and development. Strategic and business planning provide clear long term direction. Effective self-review processes assist the centre in maintaining a momentum of continuous improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre manager agree that key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>further revise the staff appraisal process, which should include ensuring that teachers have consistently measurable goals that are focused on improving teaching practice and leadership capability.</li>
<li>develop an annual plan that expands strategic and business plans by identifying specific objectives, delegations, budgets, timelines and expected outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Learning Curves Early Childhood Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Learning Curves Early Childhood Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>22 July 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
