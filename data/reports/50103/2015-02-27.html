</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Nancy Winter Early Childhood Centre is a community-based service located in Raetihi. The centre is licensed for 53 children, including 10 under two years of age. Full-time care and education is provided in a purpose-built building. Many children attend the centre part time and almost half of the children on the roll identify as Māori.</p><p>The centre is governed by the Raetihi Early Childhood Trust (the Trust) that has a focus on sustainable early childhood provision. A manager acts as the conduit between the trust and the centre and oversees the day-to-day running of the service. A leadership team of experienced teachers provides mentorship and supports teachers' professional growth.</p><p>The teaching philosophy states the mana of people is nurtured through reciprocal relationships. The interests of the child, family and community are the basis for what occurs in the centre.</p><p>Most of the teaching team members are qualified in early childhood education or are in training. The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and whānau are warmly received and welcomed into the centre. Leaders and teachers know their families and community well. They are committed to providing a caring and supportive learning environment for children.</p><p>The curriculum is child-led. Children's risk-taking within a safe environment is well supported. Children make choices from the wide range of rich learning experiences. This includes a focus on mathematical learning across the curriculum. A next step is for teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of the mathematics programme provided.</p><p>Teachers promote children’s independence skills and their developing social competence throughout daily interactions. They work alongside children involved in their play and learning. It is timely for teachers to reflect on the consistent use of deliberate teaching strategies and how these are used to extend and challenge children’s thinking and learning.</p><p>Responsive and consistent care-giving supports infants' and toddlers' need for a strong and secure attachment. Teachers are flexible and responsive to their individual needs.</p><p>Teachers' use of te reo Māori and aspects of tikanga Māori is developing. They have indicated they plan to further their understanding of the local indigenous history. ERO strongly supports this direction. This should also include a discussion with whānau about what success for Māori as Māori should look like in this centre.</p><p>Well presented portfolios highlight children’s engagement in the programme, developmental milestones and emerging friendships. A next step is for teachers to show how they plan to add depth and complexity to children’s learning over time. Parents' aspirations for their child should be used to inform the programme offered.</p><p>The manager efficiently leads day-to-day centre operation. Through this role connections are formed with the wider Waimarino education community, including liaison with other agencies to advocate for children. The experienced teaching team established since the last review provides strong support and professional guidance for teachers.</p><p>The appraisal process is well managed and improvement focused. A next step is to strengthen the level of critical assessment in this process. Teachers have recently participated in professional learning focusing on self review for improvement and accountability. The evaluative process should continue to be strengthened by deliberately considering the impact for children.</p><p>The community-based Trust effectively governs centre operation. The strategic plan appropriately identifies priorities including staff professional development and support for teaching qualifications. To strengthen sustainable practices the Trust should rigorously monitor the progress towards achieving the identified strategic goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Next steps to improve the quality of teaching and learning are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>the consistent use of effective teaching strategies</li>
<li>the bicultural programme and promoting success for Māori as Māori</li>
<li>assessment and planning</li>
<li>the level of critical assessment through the appraisal process</li>
<li>self review and evaluation, including evaluating the impact of the mathematics curriculum and monitoring the implementation of the strategic plan.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nancy Winter Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Nancy Winter Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central Select Region</p><p>27 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
