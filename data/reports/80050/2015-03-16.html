</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Dunstan Educare Ltd, Ngapara Street is one of two independently owned centres in Alexandra. One of the owners is the head teacher. It provides a full-day education and care service for children over three years of age. The children who attend this service mostly come from the second centre in Gregg Street. There are high levels of qualified staff.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy/vision is to support children’s developing interests and to promote a love of learning. As part of a centre-wide focus, children learn to care for the environment. Older children participate in a programme, two days per week that helps prepare them for going to school.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2011 teachers have improved their planning and the quality of children’s records of learning. The outdoor area has been extended. Improving strategic planning and self review continue to be areas for the centre to develop.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Relationships at the centre are positive, caring and supportive. Teachers support children in respectful and inclusive ways. Children play well together for sustained periods of time. The staff work as a team to provide many learning opportunities for the children. Children are familiar with their teachers and freely approach them for support and acknowledgement.</p><p>Teachers are very responsive to children’s needs and interests. They take time to genuinely listen to children and explore the deeper meanings in their learning. Teachers extend children’s learning through meaningful questioning and conversations. Parents are warmly welcomed into the centre and encouraged to share key information about their children’s care and learning.</p><p>Learning programmes often arise out of individual children’s interests. They have many opportunities for authentic learning through excursions into the local community and visits from adults with experiences and skills to share. A special feature of this centre is the depth and richness of group learning experiences such as visiting the local x-ray department to learn more about the human body.</p><p>Children benefit from:</p><ul>
<li>a bicultural dimension in the programme</li>
<li>readily sharing their mihi, learning about Mātariki and legends and hearing some te reo Māori</li>
<li>the many opportunities they get for music and movement and to be creative.</li>
</ul><p>Mathematics concepts are well integrated into the everyday activities and conversations between teachers and children. The centre is well resourced to support children’s mathematics learning. Many other activities focus on learning about how to care for the environment.</p><p>Individual teachers take responsibility for settling new children into the centre. A transition to school programme operates twice weekly to build children’s independence, confidence, literacy and mathematics skills. Parents appreciate the progress and success children have in this programme. Teachers have developed strong links with local schools to support children’s transition to school.</p><p>Children’s records of learning are useful. They clearly identify children’s interests, dispositions and what teachers will do to extend the learning. They also summarise the learning that has taken place over time. Teachers include children in decisions about the resources and centre environment.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers are developing their understanding of in-depth self review. They have carried out several spontaneous reviews to make improvements at the centre. Planned reviews should be carried out and documented. A schedule for self review would be useful.</p><p>The centre’s priorities and associated goals need to be reviewed to ensure the most important aspects for centre development are focused on and monitored. There should be closer links between the annual plan and the strategic plan.</p><p>Aspects of the indoor and outdoor environment should be reviewed with a view to improving general maintenance and presentation.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Dunstan Educare Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Dunstan Educare Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>16 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
