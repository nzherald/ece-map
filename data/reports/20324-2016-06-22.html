</table><p>ERO recommends that the centre manager and staff access centre-wide professional learning and development to review and improve the quality of the learning environment, the curriculum and teaching practices.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Koru Early Learning Centre, in Birkdale, provides full day education and care for 32 children, including up to 10 children under two years of age. Children come from diverse cultural backgrounds. The centre's philosophy focuses on the importance of parents and families, and providing a variety of learning opportunities and meaningful experiences in a welcoming, home-like environment.</p><p>The centre provides for children in two rooms, one for toddlers, and one for children up to school age. The rooms have adjoining outdoor play areas, and all age groups are able to mix freely with each other throughout the day.</p><p>The centre owner provides leadership for the centre, and has responsibility for management and administration systems. Future plans are to establish a management committee and appoint an assistant manager to share leadership and management responsibilities. Four staff are registered teachers and one teacher is in training.</p><p>ERO's 2013 report affirmed the atmosphere of security and trust and the encouragement of children's independence and initiative. These aspects have been maintained. Teachers have improved opportunities for children and their families to express their own cultures in the programme and learning environment. Internal review to extend opportunities for the babies and toddlers has been well progressed by teachers in the centre.</p><p>In December 2015, the long serving manager became the centre owner. The manager and staff have focused on building and maintaining positive relationships and support for families and children. A new leadership structure is now in place and includes the owner/manager, an assistant manager and a senior teacher.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers have positive relationships with children and provide an inclusive and welcoming environment for families. Routines for infants and toddlers are responsive, and interactions with all children are attentive and frequent.</p><p>Children are settled, happy and have a strong sense of belonging. They are free to choose from resources or general play activities. Mixed age play is encouraged and valued. Children's play is uninterrupted and routines are unobtrusive. A recent review has resulted in more respectful interactions and some meaningful learning opportunities at meal times.</p><p>Teachers skilfully follow children, in their play experiences. Teachers could now use open-ended questions more deliberately to challenge children's thinking and promote problem-solving skills. They could also develop strategies to foster extended and reciprocal conversations to promote children's language development.</p><p>Teachers have developed opportunities for children to learn about Māori culture and language. They are starting to promote educational success for tamariki Māori as Māori, by including whānau and iwi information on the whānau board display. More work and increasing staff commitment will help to ensure that the focus on bicultural practices gains the desired traction.</p><p>Children have a range of learning experiences that promote creativity, exploration and physical challenges. Teachers in the under-two area have reviewed and improved the learning environment to stimulate interest and encourage exploration. Recent reviews of the indoor environment and the whānau board display have strengthened teachers' focus on celebrating children's interests, learning experiences and cultural backgrounds. Portfolios are an attractive collection of stories about children's activities and experiences in the centre.</p><p>The centre has a variety of strategies to support children and their families as they transition to school.</p><p>Teachers should strengthen the programme by planning more intentionally to respond to and extend children's interests and strengths. Deliberate planning and teaching strategies to integrate literacy, maths, science and music into the programme would enrich children's learning. Teachers should also include children's and parents' input in the curriculum and consider ways to make children's learning more visible in the environment.</p><p>The new leaders are enthusiastic and keen to learn. The centre manager recognises the strengths of her teachers and is sharing leadership responsibilities to build teacher capability. Teachers work well as a team and have good opportunities for professional learning. The centre manager is aware of the need to review and improve teacher appraisal systems in the light of new requirements.</p><p>The centre manager has developed management and action plans to guide future decisions related to finances, property, staffing, marketing and professional learning and development. The centre's philosophy provides a framework for centre values, beliefs and goals. Leaders and teachers should consider reviewing the philosophy to help align teachers' thinking with practice. They could develop this philosophy into a more practical tool by collaboratively producing explicit indicators of good practice to guide their teaching. These could then be used to better evaluate teacher practices and how they impact on children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders should access external expertise and support to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop strategic and annual planning that includes links to the development of curriculum and teaching practices, and to improved outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen planning, assessment, evaluation and teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish systems and processes for effective internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>carry out an in-depth review of the learning environment and how effectively it is supporting children's learning and engagement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build leadership capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review and rationalise policies and procedures, including those that promote positive guidance for social competence.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Koru Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance. To meet requirements the service needs to ensure that there is:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>an ongoing process of internal evaluation to maintain and improve service quality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an appropriate variety of good quality resources and equipment to support children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a curriculum that is informed by assessment, planning and evaluation that demonstrates an understanding of children's learning, their interests, their whānau and life contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a system for checking sleeping children every 5-10 minutes for warmth, breathing and general well-being</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a set of appropriate policies, procedures and practices in place to promote children's health and safety.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS9, GMA7, PF4, C2, Education (ECS) Regulations 2008, 46.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Koru Early Learning Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>22 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
