</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Wonders (St Kilda) is a large, all-day education and care centre licensed for up to 100 children. It is one of eight Little Wonders centres throughout New Zealand. There are four classrooms with a fifth one to begin construction. The children are grouped in the classrooms according to age. The centre was operating under 2 licences and is now under the 1 licence. Teachers provide a warm, trusting and nurturing environment for children. </p><p>The centre employs 80% qualified staff and supports the training of other staff members. The centre manager and all head teachers are new since the last review in 2011. They are working well together. Since the last ERO review the outdoor environment has been upgraded and further developed to provide a range of challenges for the children. The centre has made good progress in improving individual records of children’s learning and extending self-review processes and practices. </p><p>Little Wonders is a responsive service where staff reflect on their practice and are focused on improvement. The centre’s philosophy that “teachers believe that children learn and thrive within warm, trusting and nurturing relationships” is evident in the programmes and practices in all classrooms.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><h4>Curriculum and teaching and learning</h4><p>Children’s interests, development and next steps are carefully observed, responded to and recorded by teachers. Children are purposefully challenged to extend their learning and skills. Teachers know the children well and have conversations with them about what they know and about their lives outside the centre. Teachers keep up to date with current theories about children’s learning. This impacts positively on centre programmes.</p><p>ERO observed welcoming, positive and respectful relationships between teachers and children and between teachers, other staff and parents. The manager and teachers encourage parents and whānau to contribute to group programmes and share their expertise. </p><p>Children play cooperatively. Older children’s independence is fostered through the deliberate strategies teachers use. They enjoy frequent excursions into the local environment and community, including the nearby beach. </p><p>Teachers recognise and respond to children’s strengths and needs. Children’s individual records of learning are very useful. They:</p><ul>
<li>guide teachers to think about and plan children’s next learning steps and focus goals</li>
<li>show what teachers will do to support and extend learning</li>
<li>identify how children’s learning is linked to the Early Childhood Curriculum (Te Whāriki)</li>
<li>describe what the children have achieved in relation to their learning focus</li>
<li>encourage parents to respond to their child’s records of learning.</li>
</ul><p>These records are available for the children to share with others and to revisit.</p><p>Children’s transitions between classrooms have been recently reviewed and improved. These are flexible and occur when the child, teacher and parent think that the child is ready. Transitions are supported by very good systems for passing on key information about children.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well provided for. They learn in a calm, nurturing environment where children’s language and development is deliberately fostered. There is a strong focus on one-to-one interactions where teachers follow the child’s lead and talk with/to the child. </p><h4>Leadership and governance </h4><p>The new manager and head teachers have strengthened the way that teachers work together. They are successfully building a professional learning community where teachers share current teaching and learning theories and practices. This is evident in the way leaders and teachers have worked to answer some research questions. </p><p>Leaders have a very strong commitment to positive outcomes for all children. They critically reflect on their practice and how they can develop and extend teachers’ professional development.</p><p>The centre’s self-review practices have significantly improved since the last ERO review in 2011. Leaders and teachers have a good understanding of self review and are confidently using self-review practices. Self review is:</p><ul>
<li>valued and effectively led</li>
<li>implemented with a useful guiding framework</li>
<li>recorded and revisited by teachers</li>
<li>used to improve outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>The centre’s comprehensive strategic plan and goals clearly show the centre’s priorities. Ongoing monitoring of the strategic and annual plans would provide useful information about how well the goals are being achieved overtime.</p><p>The licensee provides regular support and guidance to the manager. He is helping the manager to gather information about the effectiveness of staff induction processes.</p><h4>Key Next Steps</h4><p>Leaders and teachers need to review and improve all aspects of the bicultural programme across the centre.</p><p>Leaders and teachers should also review and clarify the centre philosophy to show more clearly centre beliefs and practices</p><p>Leaders should develop better systems to analyse centre-wide information and share the findings. This would:</p><ul>
<li>better inform decision making</li>
<li>help leaders observe and respond to trends and patterns overtime</li>
</ul><h4>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h4><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Wonders Early Childhood Centre(St Kilda) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Wonders Early Childhood Centre(St Kilda) will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>7 March 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
