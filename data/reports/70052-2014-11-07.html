</table><p>Fendalton Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>This playcentre operates under the guidance of the Canterbury Playcentre Association. The playcentre is a parent cooperative. Parents are encouraged to be involved in all aspects of the programme and centre operation.</p><p>Fendalton Playcentre has four morning sessions a week. The centre operates a ‘Babies Can Play’ (BCP) programme for babies and infants on Wednesday afternoons. This is facilitated by the centre coordinator in conjunction with another BCP coordinator.</p><p>Since the February 2012 ERO review, the centre has improved the ways parents and the coordinator discuss and record what children are learning and identify what they will do to extend children’s learning. Self review is developing and the team approach has contributed to parents’ increased understanding of the process.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 11 playcentre reviews in the Canterbury Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>This is a long-established centre that has a comfortable, supportive and welcoming learning environment for children and families. It is well resourced with a wide variety of learning activities and equipment that is accessible for children’s play.</p><p>Children make decisions about where and how they will play. Parents respond positively to requests from children to support them in their play.</p><p>The coordinator and parents have a shared responsibility and involvement in:</p><ul>
<li>observing children at play and recognising the emerging learning</li>
<li>sharing the information at the beginning and end of sessions to identify ways to build on the interests of children</li>
<li>selecting appropriate directions for learning to extend children’s interests and developing skills.</li>
</ul><p>A core group of parents is responsible for the well-written learning stories. These learning stories provide new parents with useful strategies for writing learning stories for their own and other children. The parent management team is encouraging parents to participate in training which will better support them in contributing to children’s assessments.</p><p>Children with learning needs and from diverse cultures are well supported by the caring relationships between parents and children.</p><p>The process of self review is well organised. However, only a small group of parents is making purposeful use of self review to make improvements in the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The association, centre parents and ERO agree that the next steps for the centre include:</p><ul>
<li>using information about children to make closer links between home cultures and experiences and those of the centre</li>
<li>building parents’ capacity to respond to children’s learning</li>
<li>strengthening the self-review process to involve more parents</li>
<li>continuing to build the confidence of leaders to share their skills and knowledge during sessions.</li>
</ul><h3>Canterbury Playcentre Association</h3><p>This is the third cluster review of a number of playcentres that ERO has undertaken in collaboration with the association. Each of the previous cluster reviews have identified emerging strengths from all the playcentres reviewed. This process has resulted in key next steps for the association to further support playcentres to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The association has made some good progress in addressing the recommendations from the previous two cluster reviews. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>supporting children’s transitions to school</li>
<li>re-establishing the centre managers’ appraisal system</li>
<li>improving feedback from the centre support team to parent groups about the quality of teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><p>Further work is required to develop a stronger understanding of the government’s focus on priority learners so that the association can better support parent groups to respond to these children.</p><p>There continues to be significant change occurring in the structure of governance and management at association and federation levels. This has had a major impact on the association’s positive response to ERO’s recommendation from the previous cluster review, to document future planning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps for the Canterbury Playcentre Association</h3><p>During this cluster review the association has identified, and ERO agrees, that the next steps for the association include:</p><ul>
<li>helping parent groups more effectively sustain the developments in bicultural practices and strengthening the focus on Māori achieving success as Māori</li>
<li>reviewing assessment and planning processes to help adults identify children’s learning and the ways that adults can help children with their learning</li>
<li>developing a clear understanding of the process of strategic planning at association level and sharing this with parent groups</li>
<li>continuing to support and grow emergent leaders in playcentres.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fendalton Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Fendalton Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
