</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Orchards Preschool-Douglas Street 3, located in Whakatane, provides education and care for children from three years to school age. Known as the Tui room, it is one of four Little Orchards licences on the same site. The Tui room is licenced for 30 children and at the time of this ERO review had a roll of 66 including 37 children of Māori descent.</p><p>Little Orchard’s philosophy makes a commitment to creating a warm, loving and safe environment that complements the home and reflects New Zealand’s unique natural heritage. Tui room has a particular focus on reflecting aspects of Maria Montessori education.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in June 2012 there have been significant changes to the Little Orchards’ organisation. A new general manager has been appointed, as well as a centre leader to provide professional leadership for all of the Douglas Street licences. Each licence has a specific room leader. The room leader is new to the Tui room since the previous ERO review and there have been some changes to the teaching team. Most teachers in the Tui room have had either specific training or experience in the Montessori approach to education.</p><p>As was the case at the time of the previous ERO review, children in other rooms are also enrolled at Little Orchard Douglas Street 30248 for the mornings or afternoons. This change over is so that children also experience an approach to teaching and learning that is based on the teachings of Maria Montessori. The 2012 ERO report identified a need for centre leaders to review this structure in order to promote continuous learning pathways for children. The centre has surveyed teachers and parents as part of a self review of the transition process and the survey response was positive. ERO asks that there is an ongoing review and monitoring of this practice to continue to raise and maintain the quality of this practice for ensuring security and confidence for individual children.</p><p>Immediately prior to this ERO review teachers carried out a significant review of the Tui room programme. In response to this review they have incorporated an increased child-centred, play-based programme to complement children’s access to the Montessori approach. Teachers report that this initiative has had a positive impact on children’s engagement and behaviour.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from having opportunities to follow their own interests in a play-based programme as well as having access to a wide range of resources and equipment that reflect the Montessori philosophy. They are able to explore and experience physical challenge in the spacious outdoor environment that features several fruit trees, vegetable gardens and significant grassed areas.</p><p>ERO observed high levels of sustained and meaningful play by individuals and small groups of children. Well-managed flexible routine times support children to sustain their play throughout the morning. The programme is enhanced by trips into the local environment as well as attendance at important community events. Individual portfolios provide an attractive record of children’s participation in the programme. They are easily accessible for both children and their parents.</p><p>Teachers are well supported by the room leader to more regularly use te reo Māori in their daily interactions with children. They acknowledge the importance of incorporating local Māori history, traditions and places of significance into the programme as an area for ongoing development.</p><p>Teachers maintain positive relationships with children that contribute to a settled and calm learning environment. They carefully present equipment and resources. Teachers engage in meaningful learning conversations with children particularly when they are interacting with the Montessori inspired resources. A challenge for teachers now is to strengthen and deepen their learning interactions with children involved in child-initiated, play-based activities. Teachers effectively cater for children’s care needs.</p><p>Teachers place priority on establishing meaningful relationships with parents. However, the current approach to moving children between the two separate licences each day hinders teachers’ ability to establish meaningful learning partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>The new general manager has established useful systems, policies and procedures that support the general operations of the Little Orchards licences. A clear strategic plan has been developed to guide centre development. This plan is regularly monitored by the general manager and owners. A comprehensive teacher appraisal process has been introduced. The general manager should now align this process to meet the requirements of the Education Council. The centre owners’ commitment to providing a quality service is reflected in the extensive professional development that is made available to teaching staff.</p><p>The centre leader has a reflective approach to ongoing development and has been working hard to strengthen communication among teachers across all Douglas Street and Alexandra Street licences. She has established positive relationships with teachers, parents and children. Priority should be given to providing ongoing support for the centre leader to strengthen leadership for learning across this service. The room leader has a strong focus on improvement and development of the Tui room. She has successfully led the review of the room’s programme. The room leader works collaboratively with teachers in the Tui room and accesses support and guidance from the centre leader and other room leaders in the Little Orchard’s organisation. </p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre leaders are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Relook at the daily interchange of children between the three rooms with a view to minimising transitions and interruptions to children’s learning pathways, and to build stronger continuity and learning partnerships with children, parents and whānau.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue to develop assessment records to more consistently capture children’s learning and development over time, including their interests, passions and dispositions. In addition, strengthen the alignment between assessments of children and programme planning for extending their learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide professional development for centre leaders and teachers to strengthen self review by enhancing a collective understanding and involvement.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service works with the Ministry of Education to undertake in-depth self review of daily transitions for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Orchard Preschool - Douglas Street 3 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements. </p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Orchard Preschool - Douglas Street 3 will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>21 March 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><div>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
