<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Ohope Beach Montessori Preschool is situated in the seaside village of Ohope, near Whakatane and is sited on grounds leased from local wh&#257;nau. The centre is owned and managed by the licensee. It is licensed for 30 children over the age of two and currently provides five daily sessions from 8.00 am to 4.00 pm. At the time of this review, the centre had a roll of 50 children, including ten who are identified as M&#257;ori.</p><p align="left">Special features of the centre include a programme that integrates the philosophy of Montessori education with Te Wh&#257;riki, well-designed attractive gardens that strongly reflect New Zealand&rsquo;s natural environment, collaborative leadership and a focus on meeting the emergent needs of children.</p><p align="left">The centre manager and teachers work together to set clear expectations for educational outcomes for children. Teachers encourage independence and child-initiated play in a safe environment. They promote creative activities and give children many opportunities to develop positive interactions, life skills and knowledge within routines and free play. Literacy and mathematics learning is naturally incorporated in the daily programme. Many opportunities are provided for children to experience and explore the local environment.</p><p align="left">High trust relationships are evident between teachers and children. Parents and children are warmly welcomed each day and are well informed about centre values and their children&rsquo;s health and well-being.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Ohope Beach Montessori Preschool was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Ohope Beach Montessori Preschool.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Ohope Beach Montessori Preschool was established in 2010 by the current owner/manager. The centre&rsquo;s philosophy is underpinned by the principles of Montessori education. All teachers have been trained in Montessori education and hold an early childhood teaching qualification. The centre is licensed under the 2008 Early Childhood Regulations. This is the first ERO review of the centre.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Ohope Beach Montessori Preschool provides high-quality care and education. Features of the centre include a programme that integrates the principles of Montessori education with Te Wh&#257;riki, a natural learning environment, high trust relationships and collaborative leadership.</p><p align="left">Teachers provide a programme that strongly reflects the principles of Montessori education. They promote a wide range of activities and provide children with many opportunities to develop life skills and knowledge within routines and free play. Literacy and mathematics learning is naturally incorporated in the daily programme. Teachers frequently use aspects of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori as a natural part of the programme. Children benefit from trips within the local community. Well-presented portfolios provide children and their families with a valuable record of their children&rsquo;s time in the centre and the progress they make. Children benefit from a programme that is responsive to their learning and development.</p><p align="left">Children enjoy playing and learning in a spacious natural environment that supports their curiosity, exploration and culture. Significant aspects of the learning environment include:</p><ul>
<li>a variety of learning spaces that intrigue and challenge children in their play;</li>
<li>easily accessed Montessori learning resources and equipment; and</li>
<li>good natural flow between the indoor and outdoor play spaces.</li>
</ul><p align="left">These features contribute to a calm peaceful environment that promotes both creative and structured learning opportunities for children.</p><p align="left">Teachers have established trusting relationships with children. They carefully observe children and make appropriate decisions about how they can assist and extend their interests. Children relate well to one another and many children participate in sustained play in groups of their own choosing. Parents are actively involved in the programme and participate in regular trips and special events. They are informed about important aspects of the centre&rsquo;s programme. Positive and affirming relationships contribute to the preschool&rsquo;s family-like atmosphere and Mana Whenua (sense of belonging for children).</p><p align="left">The head teacher provides professional leadership and guidance for staff and centre development. The experienced and knowledgeable teaching team works cohesively in the best interests of children and their families. Teachers demonstrate a strong commitment to implementing the centre&rsquo;s philosophy and promote a culture of reflective practice that contributes to ongoing improvement.</p><h4>Agreed priorities for development and review</h4><p align="left">The centre manager and ERO agree that priorities for development and review are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop a cohesive strategic overview that outlines the centre programme and provides a framework for evaluating its effectiveness for children; and</li>
<li>make better use of learning stories to monitor the progress of children over time to assist in the development of possibilities and opportunities to extend children&rsquo;s interests.</li>
</ul><h3>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Ohope Beach Montessori Preschool completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

At the time of this review, the centre had a roll of 50 children, including ten who are identified as M&#257;ori.</p><p align="left">Special features of the centre include a programme that integrates the philosophy of Montessori education with Te Wh&#257;riki, well-designed attractive gardens that strongly reflect New Zealand&rsquo;s natural environment, collaborative leadership and a focus on meeting the emergent needs of children.</p><p align="left">The centre manager and teachers work together to set clear expectations for educational outcomes for children. Teachers encourage independence and child-initiated play in a safe environment. They promote creative activities and give children many opportunities to develop positive interactions, life skills and knowledge within routines and free play. Literacy and mathematics learning is naturally incorporated in the daily programme. Many opportunities are provided for children to experience and explore the local environment.</p><p align="left">High trust relationships are evident between teachers and children. Parents and children are warmly welcomed each day and are well informed about centre values and their children&rsquo;s health and well-being.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p></html>
