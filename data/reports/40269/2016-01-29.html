<p><strong>Very well placed</strong></p>
</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Tauranga Hospital Play Service is located in a purpose-built facility in the children's ward of the hospital. It provides a four-hour morning session for children who are hospitalised for short or long stays. Programmes are also provided in the ward for children whose health care requirements prevent them from attending the activity room.</p>
<p>The service is governed by the Bay of Plenty District Health Board. Daily management of the service is the responsibility of the hospital play specialist (HPS) team leader. The team of three HPS are registered early childhood teachers.</p>
<p>The service’s philosophy emphasises reciprocal and respectful relationships with families/whānau that prioritise the needs of each child. The programme provides learning experiences and helps to minimise the negative stresses and anxieties of medical treatment and hospitalisation. Links to<em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and a commitment to the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand are highly evident.</p>
<p>Positive aspects identified in ERO’s 2013 and 2010 reports have been sustained over time. Respectful relationships with families, and effective leadership and internal evaluation systems remain features of the service. The HPS have continued to strengthen bicultural practices and enhance the profile of the service within the hospital and community.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children confidently explore resources with family members and the HPS. They are involved in play and conversations about their home lives, everyday activities and medical play. Children are relaxed and engaged as they make choices about their experiences in the activity room. Families’ participation in the programme is valued and encouraged. Information shared by parents is well used by HPS to build relationships with individual children.</p>
<p>The service's philosophy is highly evident in practice. The HPS communicate respectfully with children and families. They form positive relationships that help to promote the wellbeing of children in hospital. Skilled HPS listen carefully to children and respond to their ideas. The HPS find out about children's interests and strengths, make links to children's home experiences and provide resources to support learning. Their welcoming and caring interactions prompt children to explore medical play and begin to make sense of their hospital experiences.</p>
<p>A creative and thoughtfully presented indoor area prompts children’s creativity, exploration and investigation. A planned upgrade of the deck area is currently underway.</p>
<p>Māori children can see that their heritage is valued and celebrated in the activity room. The HPS team is committed to developing bicultural practices and increasing the use of te reo Māori in conversations. The team is also considering ways to be more responsive to an increasingly culturally diverse community.</p>
<p>The curriculum is highly effective in contributing to children's learning and promoting their wellbeing. Deliberate practices to assess and plan for individual children’s learning and wellbeing are well established. Children’s strengths and interests are clearly shown in group programme records. HPS skilfully identify the learning that happens in play.</p>
<p>The HPS work together to enrich children’s experiences while in hospital. There is a collaborative team culture of professionalism and high expectations in all aspects of service operations. The team leader's focus on shared leadership enables HPS to utilise their individual and collective strengths. They network widely with other early childhood services and play specialists in other hospitals. Participation in professional development contributes to improved HPS skills, knowledge and practice. The work of the HPS team is highly valued by medical staff in the children's ward.</p>
<p>Sound systems and policies guide the operation of the service. Useful long-term goals, good internal evaluation processes and a robust appraisal system enable HPS to make positive changes to support children’s learning and wellbeing. The team could add to the long-term plan each year to maintain future-focused goals.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>To enhance existing high quality practices, ERO and hospital play specialists agree that next steps include:</p>
<ul><li>Amending the HPS appraisal process to align with Registered Teacher Criteria to meet Education Council requirements</li>
<li>evaluating progress towards long-term goals and outcomes for children as a result of changes made through teacher reflection and internal evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tauranga Hospital Play Service completed an <em>ERO Hospital-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Tauranga Hospital Play Service will be in four years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO’s overarching question for a hospital-based service education review is ‘How well placed is this service to contribute to children’s learning and promote their wellbeing?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework Ngā Pou Here:</p>
<p>Pou Whakahaere– how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to contribute to children’s learning and promote their wellbeing</p>
<p>Pou Ārahi– how leadership is enacted to contribute to children’s learning and promote their wellbeing</p>
<p>Mātauranga– whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to contribute to children’s learning and promote their wellbeing</p>
<p>Tikanga whakaako– how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity, contribute to children’s learning and promote their wellbeing</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness ofarotake– self review and ofwhanaungatanga– partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service responds to children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the methodology for ERO reviews in Hospital-based Education and Care Services.</p>
<h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to contribute to children’s learning and promote their wellbeing. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"><span>ERO’s website</span>.</a></p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that contribute to children’s learning and wellbeing and are useful to the service.</p>
