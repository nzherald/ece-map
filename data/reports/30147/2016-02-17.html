</table><p>Since ERO’s last review in May 2014 there has been a significant response to the report findings and recommendation. Much of the progress and development has taken place since August 2015. Therefore, time and further support are needed to build on and embed improvements.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Frasers Little Feet Childcare is an education and care centre located on the campus of Fraser High School. It is attached to, and provides a service for community and Teen Parent Unit, (He Puawai), children. The centre is organised into two areas, one for babies and toddlers up to two years, and the other for children from two years to school age. At the time of this ERO review the roll had grown to 52 children, 27 are of Māori descent.</p><p>Previous ERO reviews have highlighted ongoing concerns in relation to governance, management, leadership and the quality of teaching and learning. The 2014 report identified specific priorities to bring about necessary improvement. These included, effectiveness and quality of governance, strategic direction, self review, personnel management, the capability of leaders and teachers to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>In response to that ERO report the centre has benefitted from the Ministry of Education’s support in identifying people with expertise, knowledge and willingness to help the centre. These people have been seconded to the board to strengthen centre governance and management. In addition, the board has accessed external consultants for professional learning and development for teachers and trustees, and appraisal for the centre manager.</p><p>In August 2015 the centre manager resigned. This has resulted in reorganisation of the management structure, roles and responsibilities. In addition, several new teachers have been appointed in the past 18 months.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The new board is providing improved governance for the centre. Trustees have implemented stronger systems for financial accountability and overall management. The development of a strategic plan sets clear direction and priorities for the centre. Identified goals under the headings of governance, management, leadership, curriculum, teaching and learning are informed by centre self review, <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum and te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><p>An important priority for the board has been to establish respectful and reciprocal relationships with He Puawai (the adjoining teen parent unit) and Fraser High School. The development of a Memorandum of Understanding among these three parties is currently being negotiated. This work has highlighted the close alignment of the visions and philosophies of the centre and He Puawai for promoting positive learning outcomes for children and their parents.</p><p>In-depth self review has resulted in a shared philosophy that reflects the aspirations of parents, teachers and trustees. This philosophy guides the curriculum, teaching practice and centre development. There is a strong focus on valued outcomes for children, and the provision of stimulating and interesting environments that reflect children’s cultures and identities.</p><p>The senior teacher is providing well-informed leadership of the curriculum across the centre. She sets clear expectations for teachers’ practice and outcomes for children. Together with a management consultant, she is establishing effective coaching and mentoring processes for staff. Her approachability, knowledge and support are valued by teachers as being beneficial in enhancing their work with children and families.</p><p>As noted in the 2014 ERO report, there continues to be meaningful opportunities for children to explore the Māori language and culture. A clear priority for teachers is supporting one another to promote the more spontaneous use of te reo Māori by adults and children.</p><p>Teachers’ interactions with children are caring and affirming. They use positive strategies to nurture children’s social confidence and communication skills. Transitions from home to the centre are well supported by teachers who allow time for parents to share information at these times. The warm and reciprocal relationships between adults, along with an established culture of care, promotes children's’ wellbeing, belonging and confidence to engage in the programme.</p><p>Learning environments for both age groups of children have been significantly upgraded. This work has resulted in improved resourcing and opportunities for children to make choices, explore and set their own learning challenges.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers have established closer working relationships with parents. Of particular significance to these relationships are the:</p><p> </p><ul>
<li>introduction of play workshops with parents of children up to two years, that develop their understanding about how children learn through play</li>
<li>role of key teachers in building relationships that promote the wellbeing and belonging of children up to two years and whānau</li>
<li>regular events and opportunities for parents and whānau to participate alongside their children and others families, and to share their views and aspirations.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>Teachers regularly record useful information about children’s interests and learning. These records are used to inform programme plans that build on children’s interests and learning. Teachers are beginning to use evaluation to assess the effectiveness of planned programmes in promoting positive learning outcomes for groups and individual children. There would be benefit in strengthening the consistency of programme review and evaluation. Children and parents value their access to assessment and planning documentation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Through self review the senior teacher has identified, and ERO affirms the need to strengthen aspects of how teachers recognise, respond to, and record children’s learning to include:</p><p> </p><ul>
<li>reflection of children’s language culture and identity</li>
<li>multiple perspectives</li>
<li>responses to parent voice and aspirations for their children</li>
<li>stronger continuity of learning for individual children.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>In addition, to build on the progress and developments achieved since the previous ERO review, the board and centre leaders need to:</p><p> </p><ul>
<li>document and share the specific roles and responsibilities of the senior teacher and centre administrator to provide greater clarity for staff</li>
<li>consider the complexities of the senior teachers role to enable her to meet expectations in relation to the development of curriculum, teaching and learning</li>
<li>prioritise the completion of the Memorandum of Understanding, and policy development and review</li>
<li>strengthen the appraisal process to include observations of teaching practice, consistent feedback and feed forward to teachers about all practicing teacher criteria, and strengthen teacher goals in relation to intended outcomes for children</li>
<li>develop effective processes and practices that support positive transitions for children and families within the centre and to school, using the findings from current self review and research</li>
<li>review the impact of programme routines on children’s engagement in sustained and complex play and exploration in the over two area.</li>
</ul><p> </p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Frasers Little Feet Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Frasers Little Feet Childcare Centre will be within two years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>17 February 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are: </p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education </li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
