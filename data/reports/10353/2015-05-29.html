</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Dannemora Kindergarten serves a culturally diverse community in East Auckland. In 2013 it changed from a sessional service and now offers a Kindergarten Day Model of six hour days. Ten places are reserved for children to attend mornings only. Teachers and the community have responded positively to this model.</p><p>The kindergarten provides for up to 40 children, with the majority being four years of age. The longstanding kindergarten staff team comprises a head teacher and three other registered teachers, an untrained teacher and an administrator. Teachers have established strong connections with Ngai Tai to support their commitment to bicultural practice.</p><p>ERO&rsquo;s 2012 report recognised a variety of positive features, including welcoming and inclusive relationships, capable children and an attractive and stimulating environment. The teaching team has sustained and extended these features. In 2012 ERO identified the need for teachers to continue developing self-review processes and to focus planning and assessment more clearly on children&rsquo;s interests and strengths. Teachers have engaged in professional development to help them address these areas.</p><p>The kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA). The AKA provides strategic leadership, a management framework, support personnel and a programme of professional development for teachers.</p><p>After extensive review, consultation and development, the AKA has recently launched a new 10-year strategic direction. Its four strategic pillars or objectives relate to educational excellence, core organisational processes, community engagement and a future focus. These objectives are intended to guide the AKA and its kindergartens in their ongoing development. The AKA&rsquo;s approach to rolling out a substantial change in its organisational structure has been carefully considered.</p><p>New AKA roles have been established to provide more targeted support for kindergarten operations, curriculum and development. Professional development is planned to support kindergarten head teachers in their leadership and management roles. A Quality Improvement Process (QIP) is being implemented to monitor quality in kindergartens and contribute to self review and ongoing improvement.</p><p>This review is one of a cluster of ten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at the kindergarten are well supported in their learning in a welcoming and inclusive environment. There is an atmosphere of busy collaborative engagement as children work and talk together, and include teachers in their discussions. These high levels of interaction reflect children&rsquo;s competence as learners and communicators. The teachers&rsquo; philosophy and beliefs about teaching and learning are reflected well in practice.</p><p>Teachers respect children&rsquo;s capability and independence. They are skilled at listening to children and extending conversations in ways that promote language development, thinking and problem solving abilities. Teachers value and respond to children&rsquo;s ideas, which are often recorded in attractively presented assessment portfolios and other programme documentation. These records provide good opportunities for children to revisit and independently build on previous learning experiences.</p><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s environment reflects teachers&rsquo; commitment to bicultural practice. The history and tupuna of mana whenua are featured along with many other displays, resources and taonga. The kindergarten has established a strong sense of identity as part of the Ngai Tai rohe. Teachers value the leadership of one of the team as she models the natural inclusion of te reo M&#257;ori in her interactions with children, and are continuing to strengthen their bicultural practices. These positive practices provide a welcoming environment for M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau and help all children to become familiar with the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p>Children select freely from a wide variety of high quality educational resources in inviting and thoughtfully presented play areas. They use resources flexibly to support their play ideas. Literacy, science and mathematics learning is included well throughout the curriculum. Displays reflect teachers&rsquo; focus on celebrating community events and a variety of cultural celebrations. Pacific artefacts, books and resources are featured. Well considered processes support children&rsquo;s transitions into the kindergarten and on to school.</p><p>Teachers have established close partnerships with children&rsquo;s families, many of whom make valuable contributions to their children&rsquo;s assessment portfolios and participate in regular kindergarten events. Teachers continue to consider ways of strengthening this sense of partnership.</p><p>Teachers work as a collaborative and supportive team. They share decision making, strategic planning and leadership. Better documentation of these good processes would help them to sustain high quality practices. Teachers are in the process of adapting their planning processes so they are more responsive to the emerging interests of individuals and groups of children. This development should help teachers to respond more purposefully to what they know about children, including their strengths, interests and cultural backgrounds. It should also support more targeted evaluation of teaching strategies.</p><p>AKA systems for monitoring and promoting improvement in kindergarten operations are well established. A variety of useful systems and processes contribute to the teaching team&rsquo;s increasingly robust self review. This self review is both responsive and planned, is supported by research into best practice, and reflects teachers&rsquo; focus on continual professional development. It often results in improvements. It is timely now for teachers to raise the level of critique of their teaching practice, and more specifically identify outcomes for children as part of their self review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teaching team is currently in the process of building on recent professional learning and development to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>more purposefully document their planning for increasing the complexity and continuity of children&rsquo;s learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen their self review, with a focus on identifying specific next steps for enhancing teaching and learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These key next steps are appropriate and timely, and reflect teachers&rsquo; commitment to ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Dannemora Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Dannemora Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>29 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
