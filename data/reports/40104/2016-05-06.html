</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Opotiki Rose Garden Preschool is a community-based early childhood service. It provides all-day education and care for children from birth to school age in mixed-age sessions. The centre is licensed to cater for up to 35 children, including 6 children up to the age of two years. At the time of this ERO review 45 children were attending, of whom 22 are identified as Māori. Children learn together in a mixed-age group setting.</p><p>The service operates under a charitable trust of elected parent members. The philosophy states that the service values and honours each unique child as learners through authentic, play-based experiences. It acknowledges the importance of Māori as tangata whenua, and aims to reflect the cultural heritage of all children, whānau and their community.</p><p>An acting head teacher/manager has recently been appointed. She is supported by very experienced, qualified teachers, including one teacher awaiting registration.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. Since the 2013 ERO review the centre has continued to undertake professional development that has improved teacher understanding and practice in planning, assessing and evaluating the curriculum to reflect the intentions of their philosophy.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy playing and learning in an environment that has been designed and developed to support their learning and growing. Particular strengths observed by ERO were the high levels of physical activity, and the opportunities for children to tend gardens and harvest fruit and vegetables, which they help to cook to provide healthy food. Social interactions, and a high level of oral communication are evident between individuals and among groups of children.</p><p>Children also explore rich opportunities that build their skills and knowledge of early literacy, mathematics and science as natural aspects of the daily programme. ERO observed children intently involved in construction using a variety of quality equipment, listening to stories, and participating in music, movement and group sharing. Te reo and tikanga Māori are included in the programme as teachers include a Māori perspective in conversations, and through waiata, karakia and Māori legends. The identity and language of children from other ethnicities are also respected and acknowledged.</p><p>Children aged up to two years benefit from learning and developing in a calm and relaxed learning environment. They enjoy playing alongside older children, including their siblings. A separate sleep room has recently been provided, ensuring that children's individual sleep rhythms and home routines can be respected.</p><p>A review of the daily programme has ensured that children have more time for sustained play and exploration. By limiting the expectations for all children to gather for a group morning tea and mat time, teachers are able to respect children's own choices and help them develop their self-management skills. Children and teachers eat together at lunch time, sharing social routines, emphasising healthy food and nutrition.</p><p>Teachers have positive and responsive relationships with children, and know them well. Parents and whānau are welcome to spend time in the centre, and state that they appreciate the opportunity to talk with teachers and share children's home experiences. Teachers are very aware of children's interests and preferences, as well as their parents' aspirations. Teachers skilfully support and extend children's learning through conversations, open questions and working alongside them to develop their thinking and experimenting.</p><p>Teachers are competent, experienced and work collaboratively to plan the programme in response to children's interests and to build on their learning. They draw on a wide range of good quality equipment and resources, and also make effective use of the wider local environment. This adds breadth and depth to the programme, and involves children in community activities. Teachers have developed useful systems to identify children's learning and share it with parents and children. Internet-based learning portfolios enable parents, and whānau from anywhere in the world, to read and respond to entries that tell them about their children's interests and activities. The centre welcomes parents to stay as they help their children to settle into the centre. A new approach has been to provide parents with information that aligns their child's early learning with the New Zealand school curriculum to assist their transition to school.</p><p>The current head teacher/manager, who was recently appointed to relieve in this position contributes to the open, transparent and collaborative culture of the centre. She has initiated a variety of self-review topics that have assisted trustees to consider improvements to the organisation's policy and practice. Other reviews have introduced new possibilities for teachers to take on responsibilities. Teachers appreciate the opportunities to be meaningfully involved and contribute to strategic planning and curriculum development.</p><p>The management trust is composed of elected parents and whānau and provides oversight of the centre's operations, finance and property. There has been an ongoing initiative of renovation and refurbishment which still continues, and has contributed significantly to the quality and usefulness of the centre facilities. In particular, the kitchen is better equipped and more accessible and adds to the home-like quality of the environment. The trust supports teacher professional development which is contributing to the inclusion of new practices and skills to the centre programme.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for centre leaders are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review assessment processes to more consistently identify progress in children's learning and development over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider re-introducing printed portfolios alongside the current digital versions. This would allow children to revisit their learning more often, and benefit from using it as a valuable, personalised reading resource.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders also need to continue to develop centre appraisal process to include emphasis on teacher reflections and self-evaluations, and associated feedback and feedforward about how they are improving their practice over time.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Opotiki Rose Garden Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance.</p><p>The service provider must implement suitable human resource practices. Processes for human resource management must include appropriate selection and appointment practices.<em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7]</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Opotiki Rose Garden Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>6 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
