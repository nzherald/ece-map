</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.<b></b></p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mini Miracles Educare Claudelands is located in Hamilton and is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 40 children, including up to 15 children from birth to two years of age. The current roll of 40 includes 10 children who identify as Māori, and a significant number of other ethnicities. It is a privately owned centre with a centre manager who oversees the management of the service. Currently, the teaching staff are all qualified. The centre operates two age-based programmes for children.</p><p>There has been a change of ownership since the previous ERO review in 2014. The centre was previously known as Learning Links Claudelands, and now operates as Mini Miracles Educare Claudelands.</p><p>The 2014 ERO review signalled a return visit within two years. Areas identified for review and development were:</p><ul>
<li>addressing and funding resourcing deficits identified through centre self review</li>
<li>reviewing staffing in the over twos’ area in order to enhance teamwork, continuity of personnel and best practice for these children.</li>
<li>improving the consistency of teaching practice, based on a shared understanding of the centre’s philosophy and vision</li>
<li>planning and assessment practices, in response to children’s individual interests and next steps in development and learning</li>
<li>advocating consistency of practice in implementing staff-appraisal processes</li>
<li>ensuring effective governance practices in the areas of finance and personnel management</li>
<li>allocating equitable staffing across the centre.</li>
</ul><p>Since the previous ERO review and under new ownership, there have been considerable changes to centre management and staff. In addition, the service has experienced roll growth and the new owners have made significant upgrades to the buildings and grounds. Centre leaders have worked with the Ministry of Education to address the identified issues. This review by ERO acknowledges sufficient progress made by the service in all areas.   </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre director and manager provide constructive governance and management for Mini Miracles Educare Claudelands. In a short time, they have developed a clearly defined philosophy, and set policy and procedures to guide centre operations. Progress has been made to significantly improve the premises and playground, strengthen relationships with parents and whānau, and recruit qualified teachers. The centre leaders are committed to the provision of high quality education and care service for parents and whānau.</p><p>The centre manager provides effective leadership and models high quality practice. She has been focused on developing a collaborative team culture and ensuring interactions with parents are positive and respectful. Since taking over her role, she has developed and begun to implement self-review and teacher registration processes to support teacher development.</p><p>The centre’s priorities include empowering each child to become a competent, confident and active learner and communicator. Teachers provide a programme for children that promotes their learning through:</p><ul>
<li>dramatic, imaginative and creative play</li>
<li>physical development and challenge</li>
<li>social competency, wellbeing and belonging</li>
<li>links to the wider community.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers provide a play-based programme that gives children a suitable range of choices, activities and experiences. Improvements to the environment and resourcing of the centre have enabled teachers to increase their ability to extend children’s learning. They spend sustained periods of time with children at play. Teachers are developing their skills to notice, recognise and respond to children’s interests and care needs.</p><p>Children are settled and enjoy developing friendships with each other. They are learning how to play with and alongside each other in co-operative ways.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>An important priority for the centre’s ongoing development is to significantly build the robustness and quality of planned self review, at all levels of the service. As part of this review process, managers need to clearly focus on:</p><ul>
<li>improving teacher knowledge, understanding and capability to design and implement a rich curriculum</li>
<li>developing effective planning, assessment and evaluation practices</li>
<li>providing high quality education and care, specifically for infants and toddlers, including the impact of care routines on their wellbeing</li>
<li>developing a shared understanding of the service’s philosophy, expectations for teaching practice and management of children’s behaviour</li>
<li>completing annual appraisals. </li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education to:</p><ul>
<li>develop an action plan to address the key next steps outlined in this report</li>
<li>access appropriate professional development</li>
<li>provide ongoing mentoring and support for the implementation of the action plan.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mini Miracles Educare Claudelands completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p><strong>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</strong></p><p>The next ERO review of Mini Miracles Educare Claudelands will be within three years. </p><p>Graham Randell<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>13 August 2015</p><h3><span>The Purpose of ERO Reports</span></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>. </em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service. </p>
