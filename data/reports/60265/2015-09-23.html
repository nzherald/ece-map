</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Te Kainganui is a long established early childhood centre in Mt Cook, Wellington. It operates as a parent cooperative and offers all-day education and care for children aged up to five. The centre is administered by a parent committee.</p><p>Children are supported to be active learners and participants in the programme.</p><p>The centre philosophy, based on responsive and reciprocal relationships, is central to all decision-making about teaching, children’s learning and resourcing.</p><p>Families and whānau are encouraged to participate in decision-making and contribute time and expertise to the centre. Regular communication supports parent involvement. Leaders and teachers value the strong support and interest parents have in the centre.</p><p>The centre’s strategic and annual plans identify important areas to guide the future development of the programme, policies and procedures.</p><p>Leaders have responded positively to the areas for development in the October 2012 ERO report. The centre continues its good reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre is well resourced. Children are managed in a positive way. Teachers are caring and kind in their relationships with children.</p><p>Transitions into the centre and to school are flexible and individualised. Teachers support parents’ choices and provide a good range of information to them. Continuing to develop relationships with new entrant teachers should assist sharing information about children and the centre programmes when they go to school.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to children’s interests and emerging ideas. Children have choices about their learning and participation in activities. Literacy, music, mathematics and creativity are well integrated in the curriculum. Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are authentically included in everyday activities. Teachers should continue to strengthen the evidence they gather about how they are responding to children’s interests and helping them to progress.</p><p>Highly inclusive practices effectively support families and whānau to participate in the life of the centre. Teachers value and include families’ cultures, languages and identities in the programme.</p><p>Children and teachers work and play together in designated mixed-aged family groupings. Supporting all teachers to further develop their understanding of appropriate programmes and strategies for working with infants and toddlers in group care, is a next step.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well catered for in programmes that are responsive to their strengths and needs. Leaders use their knowledge of the assistance available through agencies and the community to support these children, their families and whānau.</p><p>Teachers’ approach to planning continues to develop. They are trialling projects and planning stories to increase the visibility of children’s learning at the centre. Keeping these stories accessible and current should help children to revisit and reflect on their learning. All children have portfolios that detail what teachers are noticing about their learning. A digital technologies-based programme is increasingly engaging parents in their children’s learning at the centre and home.</p><p>Centre management is focused on improvement. There is a collaborative and inclusive team culture where input from teachers, children, parents and whānau is sought to guide decisions about the programme and resourcing.</p><p>A well-developed, supportive teacher appraisal process provides constructive feedback to teachers about their practices. Teachers use evidence from their teaching to identify their goals and professional learning to continue to improve outcomes for children. A next step is to ensure the centre manager is appraised against the Practising Teacher Criteria.</p><p>A new and more collaborative approach to strategic planning is being developed. Leaders are ensuring it has stronger links to the centre’s vision, philosophy and evaluation processes. Including indicators of success in the plan will assist leaders to measure progress and identify areas to change or develop further.</p><p>The current philosophy review is supporting teachers to articulate and implement agreed values that underpin teaching and learning.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are highly reflective practitioners. They have regular meetings to discuss children’s interests, learning and the programme. The centre’s self-review process continues to be developed. Making reviews more evaluative should better support decision-making about next development steps.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO identified priorities for improvement. These include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening the evidence teachers gather about how they are responding to children’s interests and helping them progress</li>
<li>keeping planning stories visible and current so children can revisit and reflect on them</li>
<li>developing teachers’ understanding of appropriate programmes and strategies for working with infants and toddlers.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Te Kainganui Early Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Te Kainganui Early Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>23 September 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
