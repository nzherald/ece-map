<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Edukids Ponsonby Big House is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Ponsonby Babies Cottage and Ponsonby Big House are two well established early childhood centres that share adjoining sites in Vermont Street, Ponsonby. Together they provide education and care for children from three months to school age.</p><p>The Big House provides education and care for up to 48 children from approximately two years of age to school age. The older children at the Big House spend much of their day in The Workshop, an adjacent building.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO review extensive work has been completed to improve the large outdoor area. All-weather surfaces have been upgraded and improvements made to the play facilities.</p><p>The centre is owned and operated by Kidicorp Limited. Day-to-day operations are managed by a centre manager, who is assisted by experienced staff. The centre manager receives good support and guidance from Kidicorp management systems and support personnel.</p><p>Some teachers have worked for several years at the centre, while others are relatively new. Managers, including those who visit the centre from Kidicorp Limited, are experienced in their roles. They support teachers to develop their practice, including providing regular professional development on assessing children's learning and on planning programmes relevant to the children.</p><p>Previous ERO reports have commented positively on management systems and the effectiveness of the centre leadership to support ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The centre follows a philosophy, based on <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, which focuses on providing a safe environment where children&rsquo;s interests, social and cognitive skills and mana are nurtured. The centre acknowledges the importance of working in partnership with families.</p><p>Children learn and are cared for in a supportive and encouraging environment. Teachers engage children in conversations, listening to, and responding to their contributions. These discussions provide many opportunities for children to extend their oral language skills. Interactions are positive and affirming. Children are encouraged to:</p><ul>
<li>respect each other, their teachers, the environment and resources</li>
<li>be independent and develop self-help skills</li>
<li>develop social and interpersonal skills</li>
<li>take risks within a supportive environment</li>
<li>develop problem solving skills.</li>
</ul><p>Children engage in age-appropriate activities with teacher support. The programme allows children to play for extended time periods without interruptions. The centre is well resourced to support learning and the resources are organised and accessible. Children have access to a large outdoor area that encourages physical activity and exploration. Early literacy and numeracy development is supported by resources and teacher interactions.</p><p>Te reo M&#257;ori is now more evident in the centre environment. Language prompts are displayed to support teachers to use te reo M&#257;ori within the programme. To support M&#257;ori children to grow in confidence and identity as M&#257;ori, centre managers and teachers acknowledge that:</p><ul>
<li>further professional development is required to build teacher confidence and competency in te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori</li>
<li>a more proactive approach should be taken to identify and acknowledge the aspirations parents have for their children as M&#257;ori.</li>
</ul><p>Good progress has been made in developing assessment practices and planning processes that respond to children&rsquo;s interests. Programmes are evaluated regularly. Head teachers encourage teachers to be involved in reviewing how assessment and planning occurs and in promoting on-going improvements in these areas.</p><p>The older children have opportunities to extend their learning and readiness for school through the programme provided in The Workshop. They are able to explore group interests over several weeks. Centre staff manage transition into the centre, and within and between the centres, and to school, very well.</p><p>The centre is inclusive of children from all cultures and sensitive to catering for those with diverse needs.</p><p>The centre is well managed. Kidicorp procedures and policies, adapted to meet the context of the centre, guide the centre operations. The professional support manager and the business manager make regular visits to the centre to evaluate the quality of the service provided and to support on-going improvement.</p><p>Good systems are in place to promote ongoing improvement and sustain good practice. The centre&rsquo;s development is guided by strategic and annual plans, and progress against these is monitored. Well informed self review identifies areas for development and contributes to change. Parents, teachers and other staff contribute to self review. Teachers&rsquo; reflection on their professional practice and information gathered through staff appraisal helps identify areas for professional development.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Edukids Ponsonby Big House completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>24 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
