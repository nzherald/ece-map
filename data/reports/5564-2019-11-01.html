</table><p>Victory Square Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Victory Square Kindergarten provides all-day education and care for up to 49 children, aged over two years. The kindergarten serves a culturally diverse community. Many of the families have come to New Zealand as refugees.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy identifies values of tolerance, curiosity, respect, exploration, resilience, partnership, equity and inclusive practice. It expresses a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi-based practices. The kindergarten is a member of the Enviro-Schools programme.</p><p>The association employs qualified early childhood teachers, teacher aides and an administrator in each kindergarten. Victory Square Kindergarten also has a whānau support worker. Since ERO's June 2016 review the outdoor playground has been upgraded.</p><p>Victory Square Kindergarten is governed and managed by the Nelson Tasman Kindergarten Association (the association). Since the previous 2016 ERO review, a new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has been appointed. A team of senior education advisors (SEA) oversee and support the professional practice of the teaching team. The 2018 ERO evaluation identified a number of key next steps for the board. These included improving planning to support the achievement of the board’s strategic objectives and ensuring that reporting is evaluative and focuses on outcomes for children. Progress is ongoing.</p><p>ERO's 2016 report identified key next steps for this kindergarten in programme planning, assessment and self review. These processes and teacher practices continue to be developed.</p><p>This review was one of four in the Nelson Tasman Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well supported to engage with their peers in respectful ways. Collaborative play is evident, and children's social competence is well promoted. The child-led programme encourages curiosity and exploration in a well-resourced environment. Teachers work alongside children maximising opportunities to extend their play and learning.</p><p>Teachers are welcoming, responsive and respectful in their interactions with children and whānau. Children's home cultures are valued, and the environment reflects this. The spacious outdoor area encourages children to be active and explore their developing physical capabilities. Teachers support these experiences by being active role models engaging in the play themselves to purposefully extend children's learning.</p><p>There are many opportunities for children to participate in well-considered science learning opportunities within the curriculum. These are reflected through the planned learning programme and children's assessment information.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well supported. Teachers effectively identify and minimise barriers to children’s full participation in the curriculum and learning. This approach is well supported by the association. External agencies are accessed where appropriate to support individual children.</p><p>Bicultural practice is valued and evident in the programme. Kaupapa Māori-based values such as rangatiratanga and kaitiakitanga underpin the curriculum. Teachers use te reo and waiata Māori in purposeful group time activities. A next step is to further integrate te reo Māori throughout all aspects of the programme.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have identified that strengthening the curriculum to reflect places of value for Māori and the community is an area for further development.</p><p>Children’s sense of belonging is nurtured through the well-considered transition-to-school process. Their wellbeing and belonging are suitably fostered through the reciprocal relationships evident between kindergarten, leaders and support services.</p><p>Group planning is reflective of children’s interests. Learning outcomes are identified and teaching strategies are considered. Leaders recognise that further work is required to evaluate the impact of the planned programme on children’s learning.</p><p>Children's profile books highlight their developing friendships, emerging interests and at times support continuity of learning. Multiple teacher perspectives are valued in children's assessment and teachers have a depth of knowledge about each learner. Leaders have identified that integrating and reflecting parents and whānau aspirations as part of this process is a next step. In addition, planning should show how teachers will add depth and complexity to children's learning and better reflect progress through assessment.</p><p>A sound internal evaluation framework guides practice. Teachers regularly engage in reflection and review and are improvement-focused. Strengthening the depth of analysis and providing more evaluative reporting should support the teaching team to more clearly measure the impact of their practices on children’s learning.</p><p>Leaders and teachers show a strong commitment to the philosophy of the kindergarten.</p><p>The board is well informed about outcomes from association-wide strategic reviews and the progress being made to achieve strategic goals.</p><p>The board and association are taking deliberate action to support Māori, Pacific and children with diverse learning needs. The association have developed strong relationships with community organisations to support children and their whānau.</p><p>Appraisal is supporting growth in teacher capability. The association should update the performance management policy and the appraisal procedure. In addition, the association should introduce the Teaching Council appraisal summary annual report as part of the endorsement process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to build teachers' capacity to integrate the use of te reo Māori in the curriculum</li>
<li>enhance the curriculum by reflecting places of value for Māori and the community</li>
<li>further develop assessment practices</li>
<li>strengthen the internal evaluation process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Victory Square Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice the association should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>review with urgency policies that are not current.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>1 November 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
