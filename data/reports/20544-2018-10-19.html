</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kinderhaven Preschool Glenfield is one of two centres operated by the same owner. The centre is licensed to provide full-day education and care for 45 children over two years of age. Some children attend part-day sessions. The centre supervisor oversees day-to-day operations. The owner supports her with administration related tasks.</p><p>Since ERO's 2015 review, there have been some changes in leadership and in the teaching team. Current leaders and teachers are reviewing the centre’s philosophy, in consultation with parents, to ensure that it incorporates the new team's beliefs and values.</p><p>Next steps identified in ERO's 2015 report were to review centre routines, group programmes and evaluation practices. The centre also needed to build leadership capacity, develop long-term centre goals, and promote success for Māori and Pacific learners. There has been some progress in these areas and several remain as next steps.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and respectful in the centre environment. They are supported to work cooperatively in small groups and develop strong friendships. Children participate in familiar centre routines and choose from the range of activities provided in the indoor and outdoor environments.</p><p>Teachers are welcoming and approachable and have good relationships with parents and whānau. They regularly speak with parents about their children's participation in centre routines and learning programmes. Parents who spoke to ERO said that they appreciate support from teachers in the inclusive, family friendly environment.</p><p>Teachers engage children in friendly conversations and encourage their participation in the programme. Literacy and numeracy learning is incorporated in children's play. Children have opportunities to use digital devices, with teachers' support, to share significant centre happenings with their parents. Children's cultures are acknowledged through wall displays and some resources.</p><p>Teachers need to develop a responsive local curriculum and strengthen their bicultural practices. They should continue to increase the visibility of planned teaching strategies for building on children's prior learning, extending their thinking and adding complexity to their play. It would be useful for teachers to evaluate the quality and quantity of resources and explore ways to create more educationally stimulating environments.</p><p>Teachers focus on group interests in their planning and set up relevant activities for children. Parents can access their children's learning stories online. Leaders and teachers should also enable children to revisit their learning through easily accessible portfolios.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have a suitable process for internal evaluation. To improve this, they should identify an evaluative focus, set specific indicators, and analyse the impact of resulting changes on outcomes for children and the centre's strategic direction.</p><p>There is a strong culture of trust within the centre. Professional development should help to improve management practices and build leadership capacity, as new leadership roles are established.</p><p>Centre leaders are developing a centre-specific strategic vision and plan, and have established a new appraisal process. Modifying the annual action plan so that it aligns with the strategic vision and goals and targeted professional development, should support steady progress towards achieving centre priorities.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps to support ongoing centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improving internal evaluation processes so that they contribute more effectively to improved quality of teaching practice, learning programmes and outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continued professional learning and development to support ongoing improvements in leaders' and individual teachers’ professional practice.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kinderhaven Preschool Glenfield completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, the owners and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>use the evaluation of regular emergency drills to inform the annual review of the service's emergency plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase the rigour of risk assessment and management for all excursions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly document budgeting for teachers' professional development.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified non-compliance relating to internal evaluation. To meet requirements the service needs to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure that the ongoing process of internal evaluation that considers all aspects of the service's operation and incorporates the views of the staff and parents</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA 4,6.</em></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kinderhaven Preschool Glenfield will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>19 October 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
