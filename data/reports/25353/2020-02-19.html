</table><p>Fetu'u Moana Catholic Early Childhood Preschool requires external support to ensure that the programme for children is based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Support is also required to establish effective management processes and a policy framework that complies with current legislation.</p><p>Fetu'u Moana Catholic Early Childhood Preschool is not well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fetu'u Moana Catholic Early Childhood Preschool is a Tongan language immersion service in Papatoetoe, Auckland. It is licensed for 30 children, including up to five aged under two years. Infants and toddlers are integrated into the programme with older children. Almost all children attending are Tongan.</p><p>The centre operates under the governance of the Tongan Catholic Chaplaincy with a management committee of church, parent and staff representatives. The centre has two registered teachers who are supported by four other staff.</p><p>The centre has a variable reporting history with ERO. The 2016 ERO report identified several areas for improvement, including providing purposeful and challenging learning programmes for children, evaluation of strategic goals, self review and teacher appraisal processes. Centre policies needed to align with legislation and be regularly reviewed. There has been minimal progress in these areas, some of which had been identified in earlier ERO reports.</p><p>Significant staffing changes over time have constrained progress in several key areas of service operation. Achieving and sustaining good quality practices remains a challenge for leaders and teachers.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The special character of the centre is evident in practice. Adults promote Catholic and Tongan values. Children have a sense of belonging, know the centre routines well and are confident to lead singing in Tongan and te reo Māori. Teachers and children experience respectful relationships. Teachers are nurturing in their care for children under two.</p><p>The programme for children should be more clearly based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>. Leaders and teachers need to develop a motivating and purposeful programme to engage children in their learning. Planning needs to include specific teaching strategies that enable teachers to assess and evaluate the effectiveness of the programme for all children.</p><p>When designing the learning programme, leaders and teachers need to plan for children's curiosity and creativity through complex play. A focus on promoting learning dispositions and providing opportunities for children to develop social, oral and self-management skills would support this development.</p><p>Leaders and teachers should review each area of play to ensure that good quality resourcing supports intentional teaching and helps children to actively participate in learning. A significant improvement in learning resources would promote greater choice and challenge in programmes for children.</p><p>The service's philosophy promotes an holistic approach to learning, with a focus on Tongan language and culture. External guidance to write a strategic plan would help the governance committee and leaders to realise their vision for the service.</p><p>A policy review schedule should be established to ensure that practices are kept current with changes in legal requirements. Governance training for centre leaders would assist in the development of a policy framework.</p><p>Performance management systems need to be strengthened and embedded. Centre leaders need to ensure that the new appraisal system offers specific and useful feedback in relation to the standards for the teaching profession.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for the governance committee and centre leaders are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop and regularly review a strategic plan that supports the enactment of the centre's vision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure current legal requirements are incorporated in regular policy review</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implement performance management processes that guide improved teaching practice and meet Teaching Council requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>seek assistance to embed the expectations of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, and to establish teaching practices that engage children in their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop internal evaluation that incorporates the use of indicators of effective practice and contributes to improved learning programmes and outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fetu'u Moana Catholic Early Childhood Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance and provision for health and safety. To meet requirements, the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>policies that align with current legal requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety, including supervision, medication records, excursion policies and procedures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fire evacuation practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing, including appointments process and police vetting.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA6,7,7A, HS8,17,18,28,31.</em></p><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Fetu'u Moana Catholic Early Childhood Preschool. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>19 February 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
