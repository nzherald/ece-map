<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><p>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</p><p>Kidditech Early Learning Centre requires further developments in leadership, management and selfreview processes to enable it to better promote positive outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Since the 2009 ERO review, this centre has had some significant changes in staffing, due to parental leave, staff going overseas or moving due to the earthquakes. The centre owner/manager returned from parental leave in February 2013. Half of the teachers have been appointed within the last year. The management team is focused on supporting the induction of these staff and developing a shared approach among the new teaching team. The centre's philosophy prioritises children's learning through science and technology. The programme is based on <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are responsive to children's interests and needs. They provide a well organised play environment and a range of good quality resources to support children's interests. Children make good use of the equipment available to try new things and explore.</p><p>Other features of the programme include:</p><ul>
<li>the opportunities children have for dramatic and role play</li>
<li>regular opportunities for children to use literacy in their play</li>
<li>the good use teachers make of excursions and visitors to the centre to extend children's understandings of the community and wider world.</li>
</ul><p>Children have regular access to activities that help them learn about science and technology. Teachers are currently focused on helping children develop an understanding of sustainable practices and the natural world.</p><p>Children play well together. They have good opportunities to develop friendships with others. ERO saw children talking confidently with each other about their play and their ideas. Children were settled, busy and involved in their play for long periods of time.</p><p>Children's portfolios are attractive and provide useful information to parents about children's interests and participation in the programme and aspects of their learning.</p><p>The new team of teachers support one another in the programme. They regularly communicate during the programme to ensure tasks are completed and children's needs are being met.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the management team identified, in ordered to respond to the significant changes within the service, the managers and teachers need to:</p><ul>
<li>provide further curriculum leadership to support the teachers to deliver a higher quality learning programme</li>
<li>give greater prominence to Maori perspectives within guiding documents, the environment and practices</li>
<li>strengthen partnerships with parents about their children's learning; including seeking and responding to parent aspirations and celebrating cultural identity</li>
<li>develop a shared understanding of in-depth self review that is well planned, evaluated and focused on improving teaching and learning</li>
<li>implement an effective appraisal system that is focused on effective teaching and positive learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>The management team should now establish long-term planning and seek external support to address the key next steps and any additional centre goals for the provision of high quality ECE.</p><p>Since the on-site stage of the review, ERO has received an action plan from the service that clearly outlines how it will address the key next steps identified.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidditech Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><p>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</p><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>14 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
