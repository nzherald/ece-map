<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Clevedon Kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. Effective practices are in place for governance, management, leadership, curriculum and teaching.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Clevedon Kindergarten provides full day education and care for up to 30 children over two years of age in a semi-rural environment. The kindergarten is part of the Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association (CMKA). The Association&rsquo;s clear vision sets the direction for the kindergarten. Strategies to achieve this vision include responsiveness to wh&#257;nau contributions and bicultural practices. The Association has a commitment to high quality care and education.</p><p>The 2009 ERO report of Clevedon Kindergarten noted that very good quality, child-initiated learning programmes were provided in a well resourced learning environment. These positive features have been sustained and contribute to an effective learning culture. The report recommended that teachers further foster parents&rsquo; involvement in planning and assessment. The centre has made progress in this area.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in six early childhood education services within the Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association (CMKA) umbrella organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten is well governed and managed. Professional support for the well qualified team of registered teachers is ongoing and useful. Specific initiatives and personnel in both the Association and the kindergarten promote te reo me &#333;na tikanga M&#257;ori and are strengthening children&rsquo;s understanding about te ao M&#257;ori.</p><p>The well-led teaching team works collegially, is highly reflective and has a commitment to professional learning. They use strategies gained from recent professional development to affirm children&rsquo;s successes and extend their use of language and thinking skills. Teachers receive valuable feedback that helps them maintain a focus on high quality outcomes for children.</p><p>Positive relationships exist between teachers and children. Teachers are welcoming, caring and attentive with children. Effective teaching practices are evident. Teachers work with children in responsive ways that recognise their individual interests. Children are friendly, settled and secure. Teachers listen carefully to their suggestions and ideas. Children enjoy a print rich and stimulating environment where literacy, mathematics and science are integrated and well supported. Good quality resources invite exploration and imaginative play.</p><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s curriculum is responsive to children&rsquo;s interests. The programme, which promotes the concept of lifelong learning, supports children within the centre effectively. Innovative developments are apparent in the programme and further contribute to positive outcomes for children. Examples of this can be seen in an information and communication technologies (ICT) initiative, the &lsquo;Language of Teaching&rsquo; programme, and teachers&rsquo; focus on the value of respect.</p><p>The Association&rsquo;s professional practice manager (PPM) team leads teachers in ongoing reflection on the quality of the kindergarten practices. Teachers are well positioned to continue developing self review processes that inform their practices</p><p>ERO, teachers and association personnel agree that next steps could include:</p><ul>
<li>involving children more closely in planning for their own learning</li>
<li>continuing to build relationships with local schools</li>
<li>strengthening ongoing relationships with families.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Clevedon Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>25 January 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
