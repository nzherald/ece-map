</table><p>The kindergarten teaching team need further support from the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association (the association) to make the necessary improvements in the quality of education and care provided to children and their families. Limited progress has been made in addressing the areas for improvement noted in the May 2014 ERO report. Action planning to bring about improvement needs to be time bound and monitored by the association.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hunter Park Kindergarten is in Waipukurau, Central Hawkes Bay. It opens Monday to Friday from 8:30am until 2:30pm. Kindergarten day places are available for children aged from two to six years. Of the 39 children on the roll, 15 identify as<em> </em>Māori. The philosophy is founded on the principles of mātauranga, mōhiotanga and māramatanga.</p><p>There have been some changes in the teaching team since the previous review.</p><p>The May 2014 ERO report identified a number of areas for review and development, including: assessment, planning and evaluation for children's learning; self review; and educational success for Māori children.</p><p>Hunter Park is one of 16 kindergartens governed and managed by the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association (the association). An ongoing programme of restructuring began in 2016 and the association has experienced significant changes at all levels. A new general manager was appointed in January 2016 and an advisor - education delivery in November 2017.</p><p>The previous ERO review identified that the association should establish, review and monitor the implementation of guiding documents in individual kindergartens and undertake self review at association level.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the Heretaunga Free Kindergarten Association.<b> </b></p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten's vision is underpinned by<em> Te Whāriki, </em>the early childhood curriculum. <em> </em>It is timely for staff to review this to identify learning priorities for children and expectations for high quality teaching and learning.</p><p>Children lead their learning. Teachers know children well. Warm and reciprocal relationships between teachers and children promote children's independence and their developing social competencies. There are positive and collaborative relationships with families and whānau.</p><p>The daily curriculum is flexible and responsive to children's interests. The environment fosters their exploration.  An immediate priority is to improve hazard recognition and supervision of children. With the number of younger children now attending kindergarten, leaders and teachers should give consideration to how the environment and teaching contribute to meeting the learning needs of these children.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation processes require strengthening. The teaching team need support to:</p><ul>
<li>develop a shared understanding of expectations of effective assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>reflect children's language, culture and identity within assessment practices</li>
<li>more closely evaluate the effectiveness of the curriculum and its impact on individual children’s learning.</li>
</ul><p>Profile book information shows that ongoing observation of children in everyday activities builds a picture of their engagement, developing friendships and learning. <em></em></p><p>Some teachers use te reo Māori and integrate aspects of tikanga Māori into the programme. The bicultural programme should continue to be enhanced through more regular use of te reo Māori.</p><p>Developing relationships with whānau Māori to support educational success of their children is an ongoing focus. Further strategies to strengthen these into learning partnerships should be explored. A next step is for teachers to continue to grow their knowledge of te ao Māori and consider how this is integrated into the curriculum.</p><p>Transition to school should be strengthened by more effective recognition and reflection in assessment of the skills and dispositions that the children will need for their ongoing learning journey.</p><p>Teachers are in the early stages of understanding and using internal evaluation. Regular self review is undertaken to support decision making. There is a need to improve understanding of and develop a shared approach to evaluation, so staff know whether or not their practice is effective.</p><p>A newly formed team is in the process of building collective understandings. Strong leadership is needed to support teachers to embed their understanding of guiding documents and to continue to work towards consistent implementation. </p><p>The governance and leadership team is well placed to continue to manage ongoing change and to set the strategic direction for the association to promote future sustainability. They are making good progress in addressing the key next steps identified in the previous ERO review. Continuing to strengthen and evaluate systems to monitor progress in individual kindergartens remains a key next step. Support for and monitoring of performance is of particular importance for Hunter Park Kindergarten. <i></i></p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Senior leaders and ERO agree on the following key next steps for Hunter Park Kindergarten to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen curriculum provision for Māori children</li>
<li>strengthen teachers’ assessment, planning and evaluation to promote increased complexity of learning over time</li>
<li>strengthen leadership through building knowledge and consistency of effective early childhood education practice</li>
<li>improve the use and understanding of internal evaluation to inform ongoing developments and improvement in children’s outcomes. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hunter Park Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements<b> </b></p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum and health and safety. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation</li>
<li>take all reasonable steps to ensure that the premises, facilities and other equipment on those premises are used safely and kept free from hazards.</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C1, Reg 46 (c) (iii); Health and Safety practices standard: general; Licensing Criteria for early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008]</em></p><p>In order to improve practice the association should:</p><ul>
<li>ensure robust regular policy review and strengthen systems to promote teachers' understanding and implementation of guiding policies</li>
<li>implement robust social media and online policies and procedures to ensure that all reasonable steps have been made to protect children's online safety and that parents are well informed of these.</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hunter Park Kindergarten will be within two years.</p><p>Patricia Davey<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>14 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
