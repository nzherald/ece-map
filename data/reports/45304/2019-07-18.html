</table><p>Portobelo Otaki Street is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Portobelo Otaki Street provides full-day education and care for children aged up to three years. Older children transition to the adjacent Portobelo Preschool. The centre is licensed for 38 children, including up to 25 aged under two. Infants and toddlers are cared for and learn in separate learning environments set up to cater for their stages of development.</p><p>Leaders and teachers in the service aim to support all children to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>become discoverers, thinkers and risk-takers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make friendships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>care for the environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>value diversity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a sense of wellbeing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be confident to participate in and contribute to centre life.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>They aim to achieve this through promoting: positive, caring relationships |whanaungatanga, manaakitanga, reciprocal teaching and learning that responds to the individuality of learners |ako, respect for the environment |kaitiakitanga, valuing the diverse knowledge and backgrounds of children and their families |tangatawhenuatanga, and collaboration with families and children |wānanga.</p><p>The centre is one of three owned by the service provider. The centre leader and team leader are both experienced and long serving. They are supported by a professional leader and operations manager with oversight for all three services in the Portobelo group.</p><p>Since the 2016 ERO review, leaders and teachers have made very positive progress in addressing identified areas for development including building bicultural practice and strengthening aspects of assessment and planning. Existing systems and practices supporting effective teaching and positive outcomes for children have been well sustained. The service provider has undertaken building redevelopment to improve internal transitions and support for child-led routines.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience warm, positive and respectful interactions with teachers. These foster children's sense of belonging and wellbeing and effectively promote their learning. Teachers appropriately model and encourage children's language acquisition and early literacy understandings. They support them to explore, take-risks and challenge themselves physically, responding sensitively to children's non-verbal and developing communication skills.</p><p>Infants benefit from learning in a rich sensory environment that encourages their active exploration, physical and cognitive development.</p><p>Children with additional needs are very well supported to participate in learning programmes and make progress towards their individualised learning goals. Teachers adapt programmes, practices, resources and the environment to promote positive outcomes for these children.</p><p>Teachers know children's interests, learning needs and dispositions very well, and plan effectively to nurture and extend them. They purposefully draw on the knowledge and perspectives of parents and whānau and their own knowledge of The Early Childhood Curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki (2017)</em>, to help them to recognise children's developing abilities. They use this to plan appropriate strategies and learning experiences. Teachers have built their awareness of children's different needs for sensory stimulation. They use this to help them to adapt the environment and teaching strategies to better respond to children's needs and promote their social skills.</p><p>Leaders and teachers make meaningful links between children's lives outside of the centre and their care and learning in the centre. They do this by learning about, celebrating and incorporating families' values, experiences, language and knowledge into learning programmes. This supports children's transitions from home to the centre, enables teachers to build on children's past learning and support their sense of belonging.</p><p>Teachers have good understandings about key Māori concepts and values and how to enact these in programmes and practices. They are sharing these more effectively and explicitly with families and children. Their confidence to use te reo Māori and incorporate Māori perspectives and knowledge into programmes, daily practices and the environment is continuing to grow.</p><p>Leaders are improvement focused and have high expectations for quality early childhood care and education. They promote and sustain effective teaching practice by ensuring:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>all teachers participate in a robust appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation is well planned, systematic and focused on improving teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>professional learning is relevant and applied</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sensible quality assurance systems promote consistency and quality.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The service provider has effective systems for ensuring the centre complies with regulations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Portobelo Otaki Street service provider/owner and centre leadership have identified, and ERO's evaluation confirms, that to continue to build on effective practice, the next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>focus internal evaluation more explicitly on the centre's local curriculum, identified valued outcomes for children and beliefs about teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to build the capability of teachers to lead internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sustain and continue to build teachers' confidence to enact the centre's bicultural curriculum.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The service provider has also identified the need to strengthen frameworks for evaluating and reporting on the quality of education and care across centres at the strategic level.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Portobelo Otaki Street completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>18 July 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
