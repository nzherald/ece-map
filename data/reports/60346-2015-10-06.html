</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Capital City Preschool is a community-based early childhood service situated in Wellington’s central business district. The centre provides education and care for 30 children from three to five years of age. It serves a diverse community. Eleven of the children enrolled come from backgrounds where English is a second language.</p><p>A board made up of parents, provides oversight for financial management, human resources, policy development and strategic planning. Responsibility for day-to-day operation is undertaken by the centre manager.</p><p>The preschool’s philosophy emphasises the importance of supporting, affirming and challenging children and working in partnership with parents to promote each child’s learning and development. There is a strong focus on preparation for primary school.</p><p>The programme includes structured teacher-led activities linked to mathematics and literacy, and child-initiated play times where children can make choices about the timing and level of their participation.</p><p>All teachers are trained and registered. The majority have worked at the centre for some years. Two have been appointed since the September 2012 ERO review. Specialist music and gymnastic teachers are contracted by the service to provide extra support for the learning programme.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers engage well with children to promote their settling and participation in activities. Interactions between teachers and children are responsive and respectful. Positive guidance is used well to promote children’s social competence. Learning conversations support their research and investigation.</p><p>The many opportunities for creative play foster children's self expression. Literacy, mathematics, science and the arts are woven throughout the programme. A calm tone is maintained.</p><p>The centre is well resourced. Materials are carefully organised to attract children’s interest and exploration. Displays are well used to support reflection on their learning. Trips are undertaken to extend the learning environment. The outdoor area provides good opportunities for challenging physical play.</p><p>Careful consideration is given to supporting children’s transitions into the centre and on to primary school. An individualised approach helps new families settle into centre life. Regular opportunities are timetabled to promote children’s readiness for school.</p><p>Teachers should ensure play-based contexts, linked to the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, continue to be the mainstay of the programme, particularly in relation to literacy and mathematics.</p><p>Leaders agree they should continue to develop purposeful links with primary schools to support the sharing of information about individual children and early childhood and primary school programmes.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs are well supported at this service. Leaders have good knowledge of relevant community agencies. Professional learning opportunities are provided to support teachers’ knowledge and practice.</p><p>A Māori perspective is evident. Children learn protocols through stories, routines and special events linked to the culture. Understanding and use of te reo Māori are evident. The manager agrees that increasing teachers’ familiarity with Ministry of Education resources such as <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em> is a useful next step in supporting the teaching and learning of Māori children.</p><p>The aspirations parents have for their children are sought and valued. Teachers endeavour to be suitably responsive to families’ cultures, languages and identities.</p><p>Teachers prioritise the need to develop strong, responsive and reciprocal relationships with parents and whānau. Use of an online programme and a visual approach to planning are promoting families’ knowledge of, and comments about, children’s learning.</p><p>Family-group teachers maintain links with homes. Teachers recognise the importance of supporting parents’ understanding of early childhood education and participation in their children’s programmes.</p><p>Leaders are proactive in reviewing and developing the centre’s approach to assessment and planning for learning. Teachers work cooperatively to identify and share information about children’s interests and developing ideas as a basis for some aspects of the programme. Individual profile books contain rich information about children’s participation in learning experiences.</p><p>The team should continue to increase the emphasis on recognising and recording the significant learning moments for individuals linked to their developing learning dispositions, and on identifying ways they respond to strengthen these. Evaluation should be more useful if it centres on the impact of the programme on individuals’ learning and the identification of next learning steps.</p><p>The centre is well led and managed. A range of guidelines supports consistency of practice and teachers’ knowledge of legislative requirements and management’s expectations. A professional, supportive and cohesive team culture is in place.</p><p>Appropriate professional learning opportunities are provided for staff. Appraisal effectively supports teachers’ developing practice. An increased focus on observations of practice and the provision of feedback linked to teachers’ goals should add further rigour.</p><p>Understanding and use of self review is continuing to develop. Through using the existing review framework in a more evaluative way, decision making about next steps should be enhanced. Further defining the values and ideals in the philosophy and vision statements should support identification of areas of practice requiring review and further development.</p><p>The board provides good governance. Trustees’ skills are well utilised to ensure board responsibilities are met. The management team and teachers feel valued and respected. Generous resourcing and a focus on improvement is evident. The philosophy, vision and strategic plan provide well-defined direction linked to outcomes for children.</p><p>Management and the board representative agree that further development of the board’s role should include:</p><ul>
<li>seeking ways to secure ongoing parental support in centre decision making</li>
<li>from time-to-time, reviewing the board’s effectiveness in relation to its role</li>
<li>identifying desired outcomes in relation to strategic goals to support monitoring of progress</li>
<li>better aligning the manager’s reporting with annual and strategic planning.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager and teaching team should continue to develop the:</p><ul>
<li>bicultural perspective in the programme</li>
<li>play-based curriculum</li>
<li>approach to assessment for learning</li>
<li>team’s understanding and use of self review.</li>
</ul><p>The board of trustees should:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop and refine the governance roles and responsibilities.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Capital City Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Capital City Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>6 October 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
