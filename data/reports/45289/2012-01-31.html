<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Kids Time Kindergarten is one of two privately owned early childhood centres located in Ngaruawahia that collectively cater for children from birth to school age. The kindergarten provides education and care for up to 50 children from three to five years of age. Many children transition to the kindergarten from Top Kidz Ngaruawahia, which is next door, and several children move between both centres on a daily basis. This is the kindergarten&rsquo;s first ERO report.</p><p>Since June 2011, the director has overseen the day-to-day management of the centre. With her guidance, the new team leader and teaching team have made very good progress in a short period of time. They have significantly improved the quality of the learning environment and relationships with parents. The director is currently advertising for a professional leader (supervisor).</p><p>Adult interactions with children are responsive, caring and affirming. Staff skilfully encourage children to make choices, to share their ideas and experiences and to plan what they want to do. Teachers provide good opportunities for exploration of literacy and mathematical concepts and aspects of science and technology. They place a strong emphasis on using books and the creative arts to stimulate and extend children&rsquo;s learning and interests. Teachers would welcome family/wh&#257;nau support to further reflect children&rsquo;s languages and cultures in the programme and learning environment.</p><p>Children are confident communicators with adults and peers. They are accustomed to initiating and maintaining their own interests, and frequently engage in sustained independent or cooperative play. Children enjoy a stimulating, attractive and well-resourced learning environment with spacious indoor and outdoor areas.</p><p>The director provides strong and effective leadership. She skilfully manages change and identifies key priorities for centre development through ongoing reflection and self review. Teachers are also reflective and focused on improving the quality of education for children.</p><p>The director is keen to further improve processes for noticing and responding to children&rsquo;s emerging interests and the level of parent/wh&#257;nau and community participation in these processes, and in the learning programme. ERO also agrees with the need to further develop the new teaching team&rsquo;s understanding of the centre&rsquo;s philosophy and best teaching practices in early childhood education.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Kids Time Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atKids Time Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Kids Time Kindergarten opened in February 2009 and was fully licensed under the<em> Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em> in December 2010. Since the previous manager left in June 2011, the director has overseen the day-to-day management of the centre.</p><p>The teaching team is new, and the team leader moved into her role in August 2011. Of the five permanent members of the teaching team, two are registered early childhood teachers and two are registered primary school teachers.</p><p>The director, supported by the teaching team, aspires to provide holistic education that empowers children to become competent and confident learners.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p><strong>Interactions:</strong> Adult interactions with children are caring, responsive and affirming. Strategies for welcoming and settling children are effective. Staff make good use of open-ended questions to encourage children to make choices, talk about their ideas and experiences and plan what they want to do.</p><p><strong>Programme:</strong> Notable features of the learning programme include:</p><ul>
<li>adults using books to stimulate and extend children&rsquo;s interests and ideas;</li>
<li>opportunities for collaborative problem solving and research;</li>
<li>exploration of aspects of technology and science, including the natural world;</li>
<li>mathematical learning through play;</li>
<li>opportunities for children to experiment with writing and learn about the purpose of print; and</li>
<li>children expressing their ideas, learning, and aspects of M&#257;ori culture through the creative and performing arts.</li>
</ul><p>The teaching team is trialling a new planning system that has been designed to make the programme more responsive to children&rsquo;s emerging interests.</p><p><strong>Learning environment:</strong> The director and teaching team have substantially improved learning opportunities for children by creating a stimulating, child-centred and aesthetically well-presented learning environment. Features include:</p><ul>
<li>a wide variety of materials and equipment that is readily accessible by children;</li>
<li>use of natural resources and high-quality wooden furniture designed for children;</li>
<li>thoughtful location of discrete learning areas to increase opportunities for uninterrupted exploration and play, and quiet reflection;</li>
<li>a print-rich environment, including writing areas, and relevant books and printed materials in many areas of play;</li>
<li>an eating area that fosters choice and independence;</li>
<li>a free flow of play between indoor and outdoor areas; and</li>
<li>a spacious outdoor environment, including a well-tended vegetable garden.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Outcomes for children:</strong> Children are confident communicators with adults and peers, and are developing strategies to manage relationships with others. They are accustomed to initiating and maintaining their own interests, and frequently engage in sustained independent or cooperative play.</p><p><strong>Teamwork and leadership:</strong> The director provides strong and effective leadership. She skilfully manages change and identifies key priorities for centre development through ongoing reflection and self review. The director is currently advertising for a professional leader (supervisor) to action these priorities. She has empowered teachers to take more responsibility for reviewing and caring for the learning environment.</p><p>Teachers feel valued and well supported by the director, and appreciate the coaching and mentoring that she provides. They work well as a team, and are inclusive and supportive of new members. Teachers provide constructive feedback to their peers. They are reflective and focused on improving the quality of education for children.</p><h4>Agreed priorities for review and development</h4><p>ERO and the director have agreed on the following priorities for review and development:</p><ul>
<li>further developing how staff notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s emerging interests, and increasing parent/wh&#257;nau participation in these processes;</li>
<li>making learning more visible for adults and children;</li>
<li>strengthening links with the wider community; and</li>
<li>increasing the new teaching team&rsquo;s understanding of the centre&rsquo;s philosophy and best teaching practices in early childhood education.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 National Evaluation Topic</span></h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs;</li>
<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners; and</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><h4>Findings</h4><p>Although there are no children with moderate to severe special needs currently enrolled in this centre, children with special needs have previously attended the centre with external agency support.</p><p>ERO has identified in this report features of this service that are inclusive and would be of benefit to children with special needs. These include targeted support for children transitioning into the centre, staff members&rsquo; affirming, responsive and caring interactions with children, and the teaching team&rsquo;s positive and supportive culture.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Kids Time Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-kids-time-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Kids Time Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Kids Time Kindergarten.</p><p>Kids Time Kindergarten is one of two privately owned early childhood centres located in Ngaruawahia that collectively cater for children from birth to school age. The kindergarten provides education and care for up to 50 children from three to five years of age. Many children transition to the kindergarten from Top Kidz Ngaruawahia, which is next door, and several children move between both centres on a daily basis. This is the kindergarten&rsquo;s first ERO report.</p><p>Since June 2011, the director has overseen the day-to-day management of the centre. With her guidance, the new team leader and teaching team have made very good progress in a short period of time. They have significantly improved the quality of the learning environment and relationships with parents. The director is currently advertising for a professional leader (supervisor).</p><p>Adult interactions with children are responsive, caring and affirming. Staff skilfully encourage children to make choices, to share their ideas and experiences and to plan what they want to do. Teachers provide good opportunities for exploration of literacy and mathematical concepts and aspects of science and technology. They place a strong emphasis on using books and the creative arts to stimulate and extend children&rsquo;s learning and interests. Teachers would welcome family/wh&#257;nau support to further reflect children&rsquo;s languages and cultures in the programme and learning environment.</p><p>Children are confident communicators with adults and peers. They are accustomed to initiating and maintaining their own interests, and frequently engage in sustained independent or cooperative play. Children enjoy a stimulating, attractive and well-resourced learning environment with spacious indoor and outdoor areas.</p><p>The director provides strong and effective leadership. She skilfully manages change and identifies key priorities for centre development through ongoing reflection and self review. Teachers are also reflective and focused on improving the quality of education for children.</p><p>The director is keen to further improve processes for noticing and responding to children&rsquo;s emerging interests and the level of parent/wh&#257;nau and community participation in these processes, and in the learning programme. ERO also agrees with the need to further develop the new teaching team&rsquo;s understanding of the centre&rsquo;s philosophy and best teaching practices in early childhood education.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
