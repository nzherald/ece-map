<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Evaluation of the Service</span></h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The centre is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children up to the age of two years.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The Next Generation Infant Care Centre is located in Birkenhead and continues to be operated and managed by the same capable owner and supervisor. The centre is now relicensed under the 2008 Early Childhood Regulations.</p><p>The centre has had very positive reports from previous ERO reviews. Centre managers continue to maintain very high standards of care and education for infants. The programme and resources are very carefully selected to meet the requirements of infants and toddlers. Experienced supervisors, staff and administrators guide the high quality practices that continue to be evident in this centre.</p><p>The centre is licensed for up to 20 children under two years. The centre is currently experiencing a drop in numbers of children on the roll. The owner is exploring ways to share the centre&rsquo;s clear learning philosophy and high quality services to restore previously high roll numbers.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The high quality care and education practices that are evident in the centre are based on positive and respectful interactions between teachers and children and families. Teachers know the children well. They have a clear understanding of the centre philosophy that they share with parents. Teacher practice reflects good awareness of education and care requirements for infants and toddlers.</p><p>Teachers have a calm manner and gentle pace that allows younger learners the time to investigate resources and make their own choices. Other appropriate practices include:</p><ul>
<li>child, teacher and family relationships that promote infants&rsquo; positive sense of well being and belonging</li>
<li>consistent care-giving that supports the needs of infants and toddlers for security and personal attachment</li>
<li>a responsive curriculum that supports child-initiated learning and is regularly reviewed and updated</li>
<li>teachers who are observant and sensitive to children&rsquo;s preferences and interests and use these to reflect on the learning programme and review outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>The centre environment is well designed to support learning. Positive features of the environment include:</p><ul>
<li>the importance given to play and learning opportunities within children&rsquo;s individual routines</li>
<li>indoor and outdoor areas that are well resourced and encourage exploration and investigation</li>
<li>a low stress, unhurried and quiet environment that provides time to learn and communicate</li>
<li>comfortable and interesting spaces for children to lie, sit, crawl and learn to walk</li>
<li>attractive displays that are inclusive and respectful of children&rsquo;s cultural diversity and reflect M&#257;ori and Pacific themes.</li>
</ul><p>Management practices support staff to provide high quality care and education. Centre improvements are guided by ongoing self review and professional reflections. Improvements that have been further developed and sustained include:</p><ul>
<li>staff appraisal systems that encourage teachers to reflect on their professional practice</li>
<li>continued use of information and communication technology to share information about children&rsquo;s learning transitions with staff and parents</li>
<li>the use of e-portfolios to share children&rsquo;s learning and strengthen partnership with families</li>
<li>teacher attendance and participation in national ECE conferences</li>
<li>well organised and documented management systems.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers and ERO agree that continued responsive self review is key to ongoing centre improvement. Priorities for self review could include:</p><ul>
<li>documenting annual goals that relate to the centre&rsquo;s strategic plan would enable staff to more formally evaluate the centre&rsquo;s progress towards the selected goals and identify centre-wide professional learning and development needs</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen assessment practices by more clearly identifying children&rsquo;s learning dispositions and developments in teachers&rsquo; written observations.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Next Generation Infant Care completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>3 Next Review</span></h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>18 June 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
