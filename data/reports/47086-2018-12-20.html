</table><p>Aurora Homebased Childcare Services is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Aurora Homebased Childcare Services is a home-based education and care network that opened in 2016 and is based in Otara, South Auckland. The network is licensed for 50 children, including 24 aged up to two years. Of the 46 children enrolled, most are Tongan. There are also children with Māori and other Pacific heritages. Most children are bilingual.</p><p>The philosophy of Aurora Homebased Childcare Services emphasises the importance of nurturing children's individual strengths through a journey of guided discovery. Values of excellence, kindness, action and trust are also promoted.</p><p>Two directors and a coordinator work together to support in-home educators to provide suitable care and learning programmes for children. At the time of this ERO review, directors were undertaking restructuring to better meet the demands of a growing organisation.</p><p>The Aurora Homebased Childcare Services organisation has two home-based education and care networks. This is the first review of this network. The second network will be reviewed a year after its opening.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Aurora Homebased Childcare Service's philosophy and the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, are evident in the documentation of planning and practice.</p><p>Coordinators and educators work together to provide sensitive support for the wellbeing of many children with diverse and complex needs. Inclusive, trusting relationships and partnerships underpin the service's approach to children's learning.</p><p>Coordinators' monthly reports record information about the children's programmes and activities and health and safety matters. Children's learning stories focus on their interests and areas of development.</p><p>Appropriate planning and assessment practices guide programmes for children. Children, including those under two years of age, experience a culturally responsive programme that values and affirms their individual identities. There is also a strong focus on developing children's respect for themselves and others, and their social and emotional competence. Social media is used well to inform and support educators and parents and to celebrate children's learning.</p><p>Children have regular opportunities to meet and play with others from across the two networks. In addition to the playgroup, children also take part in excursions that extend their learning opportunities. Practices for monitoring children's wellbeing and their health and safety are maintained through regular visits to homes.</p><p>Coordinators and educators take part in professional development that is relevant to the service's context. Good systems and accessible, useful resources are in place to support educators' professional learning. The service's appraisal processes are currently being developed to help coordinators grow their capability to promote educators' teaching practice.</p><p>The service has an established policy framework that guides practice, and this is regularly reviewed. The strategic plan is clear and detailed and would now benefit from in-depth evaluation to promote ongoing development and progress.</p><p>Internal evaluation is developing, is relevant and reflects current research. This evaluation development is evident from the strategic level through to the level of individual children's learning. The use of focused evaluative questions and indicators of effective practice would add depth to the service's internal evaluation processes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and service management/coordinators have identified relevant key next steps, which include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring children's learning dispositions are more visible in planning, assessment and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promoting effective teaching practice that is focused on children's learning outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop children's literacy and numeracy in the context of play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fully implementing appraisal processes for coordinators that align with the Education Council's requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Aurora Homebased Childcare Services completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Aurora Homebased Childcare Services will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>20 December 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
