<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Mataliki Tokelau Akoga Kamata is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Mataliki Tokelau Akoga Kamata is a Tokelauan community based centre which provides education and care for children up to five years old. The akoga operates under the Mataliki Tokelau Pre-School South Auckland Trust Board. The akoga functions from a purpose built venue surrounded by a council park.</p><p>The management team and akoga leaders have worked collaboratively over time with the wider Tokelauan community to promote a strong Tokelauan language, culture and identity which provides the akoga&rsquo;s vision and educational direction. This philosophy and vision are evident in practice. Policies acknowledge Te Tiriti o Waitangi and M&#257;ori as tangata whenua.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children are respected and treated with care and affection at the akoga. They play well together and enjoy a variety of activities provided by teachers. Children are encouraged to develop their leadership skills and their point of view is respected and valued. Children enjoy spacious areas of play in an environment that encourages them to learn through play.</p><p>Positive relationships are a main focus and there is a positive tone at the akoga. Teachers work well together and are welcoming to all children and their parents and kainga. Partnerships with families are based on genuine attitudes of acceptance, respect and willingness to listen and change. Children with special needs are included in the programme and teachers plan appropriate programmes to meet their needs. Relationships with families are underpinned by the Christian values and a shared understanding of Tokelauan cultural traditions.</p><p>Children benefit from teachers who understand the children in their care. Teachers recognise the importance of encouraging children to talk and express their feelings and ideas. Teachers take time to genuinely listen to children and follow their interests. Most of the teachers are fluent in the Tokelauan language. They have a strong commitment to developing children&rsquo;s language, culture and identity.</p><p>Centre leaders have developed high levels of trust and collaborative agreement in the akoga&rsquo;s decision-making processes. They are well respected members of the Tokelauan Community in Aotearoa New Zealand. Key leaders in the community are often part of the centre&rsquo;s community events and programmes. The akoga offers Tokelauan language and culture programmes after hours for their community.</p><p>The strong focus on continual improvement at the akoga is evident in its systems and practices. Policies are reviewed regularly and underpin high quality practice in all aspects of the service. Staff use a self-review framework that is relevant to their cultural world view. The &lsquo;ika&rsquo; framework for self review has enabled staff to critically reflect on their practice and gain a deeper understanding and capability in a robust self-review process. This framework is being used at all levels to ensure that akoga improvement is systematic, collaborative and ongoing. Clear expectations and guidelines promote a strong culture of mutual respect and sense of belonging within the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>develop staff knowledge about current theories of learning and teaching and use this knowledge to design the curriculum and to decide how they structure the programme and use resources</li>
<li>strengthen assessment, programme planning and evaluation to show progress and continuity in children&rsquo;s learning over time</li>
<li>develop appropriate programmes, learning environment and resources for infants and toddlers</li>
<li>continue to build staff capability and leadership to develop a strong culture of reflection and self review.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mataliki Tokelau Akoga Kamata completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>30 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
