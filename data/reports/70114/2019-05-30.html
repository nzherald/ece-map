</table><p>Russley Playcentre is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Russley Playcentre operates as a parent cooperative under the governance and management of the Playcentre Federation, Upper South Island Region. This centre is licensed for up to 25 children, including 20 children under two. The centre is open four mornings a week and offers a separate session one morning a week for infants and their parents called 'Babies can play'.</p><p>The playcentre employs a coordinator. Parents are rostered to help at each session. The Upper South Island Region employs a centre support person and an administrator who regularly visit the playcentre to support the parents and coordinator.</p><p>The centre's philosophy places a strong emphasis on the important role of parents in their children's learning and wellbeing. It identifies the significance of play for children to become confident and capable learners and leaders. The philosophy promotes respect for New Zealand's bicultural heritage and children's home cultures. It states that the centre environment should be a safe and stimulating place that offers a variety of learning experiences.</p><p>Since the 2014 ERO review, the parent cooperative has continued to provide high quality education and support for all children and whānau. The recommendations in that report have been met and have resulted in further improvements to assessment and planning, and internal evaluation.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six playcentre reviews in the Playcentre Federation, Upper South Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident, capable learners who lead their own learning. They are well supported by adults who are respectful and knowledgeable about the ways children learn best. Adults work effectively as a cooperative, sharing their skills, knowledge and interests with each other and the children. They effectively empower children to problem solve and learn in a variety of ways. Children's learning is well supported, diverse, interesting and challenging.</p><p>Children are happy, settled and engaged in meaningful self-chosen learning. Adults establish strong supportive relationships with all children. The high ratio of adults to children helps to ensure that children can always be well supported in their learning and wellbeing. The learning environment is well resourced and easy for children to access and select resources and activities.</p><p>Children enjoy an inclusive environment where their home culture is valued and included in the programme. Te reo and tikanga Māori are a regular part of the programme. Parents are well supported to increase their skills and knowledge in this area. Older children are actively encouraged to support and play with younger children. Adults model effectively the behaviours they expect of children. They skilfully help children to listen, respect and include others in their play and learning.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well supported. Many parents participate in 'Babies can play' as a transition into the playcentre sessions, and bring the wide range of skills they have learnt in this programme to the daily sessions.</p><p>Children's learning benefits from a local curriculum that encompasses their interests and links to home and centre learning. Parents' skills and knowledge are well used within the programme. Good use is also made of the local community and environment. This includes a strong relationship with the local primary school.</p><p>Assessment and planning effectively guide the ways adults work with children to promote their learning and wellbeing. Parents' aspirations for their children are regularly identified and well used to develop children's goals, learning programmes and to evaluate progress. Parents are active partners in all aspects of their child's assessment and planning. This ensures home and centre learning is well integrated and complements each other.</p><p>The strategic plan, internal evaluation and coordinator appraisal are closely linked. This is ensuring goals are well met and the quality of learning and teaching continues to improve.</p><p>The centre parents and coordinator are well supported by the Upper South Island Region. There is a high level of parent participation in the playcentre parent education programme. The parent cooperative successfully promotes ongoing improvement for children's learning and the operation of the playcentre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The parent cooperative identified, and ERO's evaluation confirms, that a key next step is extending the use of te reo and tikanga Māori, and increasing the visibility of children's home cultures in assessment and planning and other centre documents.</p><h3>Upper South Island Regional Governance</h3><p>There continues to be significant change occurring with the playcentre's governance and management at regional and federation levels.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Russley Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>30 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
