</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rainbow Kidz Matamata is a privately owned education and care service located in Matamata. It caters for children from approximately six months to school age under the one licence for up to 40 children, including a maximum of 15 under two. The current role is 45 of whom 20 are identified as Māori. The centre is purpose built and provides separate areas and staffing for under two and over two year old children.</p><p>The two owners have full time responsibilities within the centre. One owner who has early childhood qualifications is the centre manager and provides professional leadership for staff. The other owner who has a primary teaching qualification has responsibility for performance management and property. The centre maintains a high proportion of registered or qualified teachers.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in 2011 the centre has had a period of time on a provisional licence following concerns raised with the Ministry of Education. During this period the owners and staff had Ministry of Education funded professional support and developed a new strategic plan. This incorporated brief statements about the centre mission, values and philosophy which relate to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. From September 2013 the centre was returned to a full licence. Professional development has continued in the area of mathematics and leadership.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn through play within a welcoming and inclusive environment. They develop a strong sense of belonging promoted by positive and affirming relationships. Centre owners who identify as Māori, and their staff, role model the recognition and valuing of each child’s language, identity and culture. Children are familiar with the daily routines, which embrace tikanga Māori and encourage a settled and respectful atmosphere.</p><p>Teachers know the children well, and respond to their emotional and physical care needs. They engage children in conversations and encourage their learning. Children are provided with access to a range of resources and equipment that support their physical development and creative abilities. The programme is extended through excursions into the community and through the care of animals onsite. Children’s language development is fostered through the sharing of stories and conversations with adults and each other.</p><p>Children in the infant and toddler area are encouraged in their communication and exploration through a range of opportunities provided within the programme. Teachers are aware of children’s sensitivity to their body language. They are careful to make regular eye contact, and use visual gestures while they work at the child’s level. Children are able to move freely within a safe environment as they explore different materials for interaction and manipulation. Transition to the over two area is made easy through frequent interactions between children in the two areas.</p><p>Teachers have engaged in ongoing professional learning through reviews of aspects of centre operations and the curriculum. They report that children are more engaged as they now have wider access to equipment and spaces to support their learning. Teachers meet regularly to share information about children and to plan activities for groups to respond to emerging interests. They have made a particular effort to make the current planning more visible through wall displays. Teachers prepare well illustrated individual portfolios to reflect children’s learning through involvement in the centre's programme.</p><p>The centre owners have successfully established respectful and trusting partnerships with staff, parents and whānau, and the wider community. They lead by personal example and give generously of their time to support children and their families. Parents spoken to by ERO felt well informed about the programme and their children’s learning. They expressed confidence in the leadership of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owners and ERO agree on the following priorities for further development:</p><ul>
<li>evaluate the programme provision for young children between the ages of four and five</li>
<li>strengthen the links between performance management and the promotion of agreed best practice for teachers</li>
<li>review the roles and responsibilities shared by the centre owners.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rainbow Kidz Matamata completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rainbow Kidz Matamata will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>19 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
