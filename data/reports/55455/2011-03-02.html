<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>PORSE (Play, Observe, Record, Support, Extend, Evaluate), Rotorua, is part of a privately owned national home based care service. Children from birth to school age are cared for in their own homes by nanny educators, or in the homes of educators who are registered with PORSE. The network is managed from the PORSE office in central Rotorua, and operates within a framework of training, systems and policies provided by the PORSE National Support Organisation (NSO). Such policies outline clear expectations to guide educators&rsquo; interactions with children, learning programmes, and health and safety systems and practices.</p><p>The PORSE philosophy strongly promotes the concept of children being nurtured and educated by well supported adults. Children are benefiting from quality learning experiences in home environments and the wider community. Outings and playschools are well planned and provide opportunities for social networking, and play and learning in a wide variety of interesting and stimulating settings.</p><p>Relationships are respectful and responsive and are a significant feature of the service at all levels. Interactions between educators and children are caring, affectionate and based on trust and secure attachment. Educators demonstrate an ability to communicate and collaborate with children to extend interests and ideas. Programme tutors work alongside educators and encourage them to become increasingly knowledgeable, thoughtful and sensitively attuned to children.</p><p>At the time of this review in December 2010 there were 88 children enrolled, eight of whom identify as M&#257;ori. The PORSE service has clearly stated expectations about establishing meaningful relationships with M&#257;ori children and their families. These expectations encourage wh&#257;nau involvement and in depth family knowledge of children. As programme tutors continue to shape priorities for service development in Rotorua they should now review and develop strategies and practices to more specifically engage with M&#257;ori families and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of PORSE Rotorua S1 was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by PORSE Rotorua S1 to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the service (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atPORSE Rotorua S1.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>This is the first ERO review of the Rotorua PORSE network. Both programme tutors are new to their roles this term, and the Team Coach, while highly experienced in PORSE, is new to her role with the Rotorua team. The overall PORSE philosophy and mission statement express aspirations that aim to provide work-based adult education. This education is flexible, self-paced and designed to enhance the life-long learning and capability of adults caring for and educating infants, toddlers and young children.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Relationships: Respectful, responsive and reciprocal relationships are a significant feature of the service. These relationships are characterised by, and promoted through:</p><ul>
<li>meaningful connections between PORSE educators, programme tutors, children and families;</li>
<li>interactions between educators and children that are caring, affectionate and based on trust and secure attachment;</li>
<li>recognition of how children instinctively want to learn, and educators&rsquo; skill to communicate and collaborate with them to extend interests; and</li>
<li>programme tutors&rsquo; ability to work alongside educators encouraging them to become increasingly knowledgeable, thoughtful and sensitively attuned to children&rsquo;s emotional wellbeing and developing minds.</li>
</ul><p>The PORSE mission statement of educators nurturing and educating children in their care provides a strong framework for highly effective interactions and relationships.</p><p>Children as learners: Children experience a comprehensive range of quality learning experiences in home environments and the wider community. Children&rsquo;s trust in their educators supports their confidence to participate in both familiar and new situations. Well-planned outings and playschools provide opportunities for social networking, exploration and learning in a wide variety of interesting and stimulating settings. Educators are increasingly using strategies that support children&rsquo;s developing social competence and view of themselves as capable and confident decision makers and learners.</p><p>Adults as learners: PORSE demonstrates a high level of commitment to providing individualised learning pathways for educators and employees. A wide range of flexible training opportunities, coaching and mentoring allow individuals to achieve self-directed goals and establish meaningful career pathways. Well established systems and practices provide useful frameworks for ongoing review, reflection, support and development that positively contribute to the quality education and care experienced by infants, toddlers and young children.</p><h4>Agreed priority</h4><p>Building capability: Programme tutors should continue to emphasise the importance of family and wh&#257;nau involvement in children&rsquo;s learning. They should further develop planning guidelines to promote the significance of family, and children&rsquo;s cultural identity. Such development is likely to enhance wh&#257;nau involvement in planning and learning, and enable programme tutors and educators to increasingly respond to the cultural diversity of families and children using the service.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h4>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h4><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service;</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children; and</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p>There are eight M&#257;ori children enrolled in this service. Enrolment documentation and practices are inclusive of M&#257;ori and invite wh&#257;nau to share information specific to their cultural identity and affiliations. PORSE also has a policy that acknowledges M&#257;ori as tangata whenua. Educators and programme tutors have opportunities to access professional learning and development designed to enhance their knowledge and understanding of M&#257;ori language and culture.</p><h4>Area of strength</h4><p>Valuing wh&#257;nau voice: The PORSE service has clearly stated expectations about establishing meaningful relationships with M&#257;ori children and their families. These expectations promote wh&#257;nau involvement through respecting and building on in-depth family knowledge of children.</p><h4>Area for development and review</h4><p>Strengthening partnerships with M&#257;ori: As this new team shapes priorities for service development in Rotorua, it is timely for them to review strategies and practices to more specifically engage with M&#257;ori. Stronger recognition of local iwi, customs and culture is likely to enhance the sense of belonging of, and partnerships with M&#257;ori, and more fully realise PORSE policy expectations.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of PORSE Rotorua S1 completed an ERO Home-Based CareManagement Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>
