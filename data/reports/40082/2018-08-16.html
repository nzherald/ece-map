</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Mamaku Playcentre is a parent-led service that provides education and care for children from birth to school age. It is located in Mamaku Village near Rotorua. The playcentre is licensed for up to 30 children, including 15 under two years of age. It offers three morning sessions each week. The current roll of 15 includes eight children of Māori descent.</p><p>During 2018 playcentres are transitioning from operating as The New Zealand Playcentre Federation (NZPF) with 32 regional associations to a national organisation with six offices. In the central North Island eight associations have merged into a regional hub renamed Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island Region (PACNIR). This region includes 95 playcentres spread over a large geographic area. During the organisation transition there is some overlap between the previous Rotorua association systems and new national approaches. At the time of this ERO review there is considerable uncertainty as new processes become established.</p><p>The new governance management structure consists of a regional manager and a centre support coordinator whose role is to access guidance and management support for the playcentre. Currently the centre receives some administrative support. A national professional learning and development team is in the early stages of planning for additional learning support to build members’ capability as first teachers of their children.</p><p>Responsibility for centre leadership is shared among a small number of members. A focus for this playcentre is to engage members in training. A member with appropriate qualifications enables the centre to receive Ministry of Education funding for some sessions.</p><p>Through the playcentre’s philosophy, members hold the belief that parents are the primary educators of their children. They aim to promote learning through play in child-led activities and build strong relationships between adults and children.</p><p>ERO’s previous review in May 2015 identified key next steps for improving children’s access to indoor resources, wall displays, noise levels and self review for programme improvement. Centre members have made good progress in addressing these areas. Parents' understanding of effective teaching practice continues to be an area for ongoing development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four playcentre reviews in the Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A dedicated, core group of experienced members provide effective shared leadership for the playcentre. They have developed useful annual management plans to consistently guide centre direction. Self review is well planned and documented and is focused on improving outcomes for children and their families. A recent development is centre members’ participation in the Rotorua Playcentre Cluster. This group provides a wider support network for parents as educators. Shared leadership is contributing to sustainability of the playcentre for children and families.</p><p>The playcentre philosophy underpins the curriculum. Children enjoy making choices from a wide variety of readily accessible, quality resources. They confidently lead their play and learning in a mixed-age setting. Care routines are responsive to individual needs and preferences. A recent focus has been the establishment of vegetable gardens to promote healthy eating and sustainability in a meaningful context for children. There are many opportunities for children to express their ideas, be creative and add complexity to their play and learning. Children benefit from attending with their parents and extended family members who recognise and value children’s interests and provide continuity of learning between home and playcentre.</p><p>Positive relationships at all levels are a strength of the centre. There is a warm and welcoming culture where children and their families develop a strong sense of belonging. Children demonstrate confidence and trust in adults and develop close friendships with their peers. Interactions between adults and children are caring and inclusive. Adult interactions model and promote respect and cooperation, fostering teamwork among members and children’s social competence. Members have developed positive and productive relationships within the wider community and with specialist agencies. These relationships enhance childrens’ wellbeing, sense of belonging and support positive transitions to school.</p><p>Te reo Māori is promoted and valued. Centre members have implemented a deliberate approach to increasing their knowledge and use of te reo Māori in the centre. Some families have documented their pepeha in assessment portfolios, sharing their culture and identity. Māori children and families enjoy an environment where their culture is affirmed and celebrated.</p><p>Assessment, planning and evaluation continues to be developed. Experienced members provide some useful models for assessment. There are regular opportunities for parents to work together to identify and document aspirations for children and aspects of their learning. Attractive and up-to-date centre displays are personalised to children and contribute to continuity of their interests and learning across sessions.</p><p>Children up to two years of age benefit from nurturing and responsive care and interactions. The environment is calm and settled. Breast feeding mothers receive collective support from other members. Specific spaces and thoughtfully chosen equipment support uninterrupted sleep, play and exploration for this age group.</p><p>The centre would benefit from more effective support from the PACNIR during a time of transition. NZPF is in the process of updating existing polices to meet legislative requirements. A particular strength of playcentre is the two-house model initiative for governance. Te Whare Tikanga Māori promotes self-determination for Māori members through regular hui and targeted funding and enacts the partnership aspect of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified the need for PACNIR management to develop a strategic approach to professional development in relation to implementing the revised <em>Te Whāriki</em>.</p><p>Playcentre members' next steps are to participate in ongoing learning to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>build understanding of effective teaching and children’s learning in a child-initiated, play-based curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fully implement the revised <em>Te Whāriki</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the NZPF and PACNIR give urgent priority to developing robust systems for:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>tracking, monitoring and reporting quality assurance and compliance in individual playcentres.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Mamaku Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Action for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance related to health and safety.</p><ul>
<li>Governance needs to develop and document a child protection policy that meets the requirements of the Vulnerable Children Act 2014.<br><i>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS31]</i></li>
</ul><p>In order to improve practice, centre members need to consistently implement daily hazard checks.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Mamaku Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>16 August 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
