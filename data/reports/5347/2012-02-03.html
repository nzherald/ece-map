<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2>
<p>Pikopiko Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The kindergarten caters for children from 2 to 5 years. The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p>Children are settled and engaged in their play throughout the kindergarten and they demonstrate positive relationships and inclusive values. Teachers effectively promote literacy learning and support language development. They recognise children&rsquo;s wide ranging interests through lively narrative and recounts of children's participation in the programme.</p>
<p>Fostering a culturally inclusive learning environment is a strength of the teaching team. This is evident through the integrated approach to developing a deep appreciation, amongst the children and the community, of the significance of New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage. This approach provides the learning foundations on which positive, supportive, and encouraging relationships are built at the kindergarten and creates a climate of care at all levels. Teachers are encouraged to share and reflect on their practice.</p>
<p>Interactions are supportive, encouraging and challenge children to take risks in their learning. Thoughtful transitions within and beyond the kindergarten support children&rsquo;s well-being. Teachers organise the programme and routines around the children's natural rhythms, interests and care needs. They provide strong role modelling for inclusive and affirming interactions.</p>
<p>Teachers recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s interests in an engaging and attentive manner. However, further opportunities to extend children&rsquo;s learning across different areas could be identified and developed.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Pikopiko Clyde Quay Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atPikopiko Clyde Quay Kindergarten.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p>
<ul><li>association support</li>
<li>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The April 2008 ERO report identified that teachers&rsquo; work collaboratively to enhance outcomes for children. The environment celebrates diversity and as a result of effective teaching practices children were developing as confident competent learners. Areas identified for improvement included aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation practice and self review.</p>
<p>The kindergarten is situated in the grounds of Clyde Quay School and shares a playground with the junior school. This helps to support smooth transitions from the kindergarten into school, and often provides continuity of learning across generations.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>Programme Children are able to engage in sustained play as individuals and in groups. The programme provides opportunities for children&rsquo;s interests to be understood, appreciated and extended through spontaneous and planned activities and teaching strategies. These include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>a programme that is responsive to the cultural diversity of the community where children are encouraged and supported to participate in individual and group learning experiences. This emphasises the centre&rsquo;s inclusive approach to engaging all children</p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<p>teachers successfully creating specific areas of cultural focus within the programme to foster, develop and nurture children&rsquo;s appreciation of New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>planning programmes in response to individual needs and children&rsquo;s dispositions. Regular formal staff meetings provide opportunities for teachers to share and discuss planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children&rsquo;s profiles containing family and the child&rsquo;s views. These records are particularly inclusive of the language backgrounds of children and their families. Teacher feedback includes different perspectives on group and individual learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wall displays are compiled into a book which provides future stimulus for planning and enables children to revisit experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>smooth transitions between activities. These indicate that children are clearly aware of routines and teacher expectations. Their sense of belonging and well-being is fostered.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Learning Environment Teachers provide an effective learning environment for children. It is appropriately resourced and accessible to all children. Intergenerational relationships are highly valued by the teachers and these help to embed a continuity of learning across the different contexts of home and the centre.</p>
<p>Staff strongly welcome contributions from the kindergarten&rsquo;s multicultural community. An&nbsp;example of this is the design and construction of a tekoteko, maihi and amo to create an identity for the kindergarten, which draws on its history and place within a bicultural community. In addition to this, supporting beams that represent their different cultures have been designed and decorated by the families.</p>
<p>A warm and settled tone is evident and parents are welcome to support their children&rsquo;s learning. Children are familiar and comfortable with the kindergarten&rsquo;s routines. Processes are in place to enable smooth transitions upon enrolment at the kindergarten. A wide range of resources and equipment is available indoors and outdoors to provide opportunities for children to freely explore the environment.</p>
<p>Interactions Teachers&rsquo; interactions with children and their families are affirming. Children are supported by their peers and their teachers to take risks with their learning and grow in their sense of independence through the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>children&rsquo;s positive and caring interactions with each other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>well established and cooperative relationships with families, facilitating a smooth transition between home and kindergarten</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the use of appropriate questions to seek children&rsquo;s views and extend their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers&rsquo; well-developed use of te reo M&#257;ori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children encouraged and supported to value the cultural diversity of their peers.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p>Teachers have identified and ERO agrees that they should continue to:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>develop their feedback in profile books, to give a clearer indication of how children&rsquo;s interests will be used to extend their learning across different curriculum areas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>focus on integrating Te Manawa into their on-going spontaneous self review. Although this process is emerging, there is a need for a more systematic and consistent approach to self review.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s interests in an engaging and attentive manner. However, further opportunities to extend children&rsquo;s learning across different areas could be identified and developed.</p>
<h3>Association Support</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p>
<p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p>
<p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a wide range of professional development opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice as a result of feedback</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h4>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h4>
<p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>transitions ensure the continuing well-being, learning, and development of children with moderate to severe special needs;</p>

<p>Before the review, the staff of Pikopiko Clyde Quay Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre Management Assurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Recommendation</h2>

<p>&nbsp;KindergartenTo the Parents and Community of&nbsp;Pikopiko Clyde Quay</p>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Pikopiko Clyde Quay Kindergarten.</p>
<p>Pikopiko Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The kindergarten caters for children from 2 to 5 years. The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p>Children are settled and engaged in their play throughout the kindergarten and they demonstrate positive relationships and inclusive values. Teachers effectively promote literacy learning and support language development. They recognise children&rsquo;s wide ranging interests through lively narrative and recounts of children's participation in the programme.</p>
<p>Fostering a culturally inclusive learning environment is a strength of the teaching team. This is evident through the integrated approach to developing a deep appreciation, amongst the children and the community, of the significance of New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage. This approach provides the learning foundations on which positive, supportive, and encouraging relationships are built at the kindergarten and creates a climate of care at all levels. Teachers are encouraged to share and reflect on their practice.</p>
<p>Interactions are supportive, encouraging and challenge children to take risks in their learning. Thoughtful transitions within and beyond the kindergarten support children&rsquo;s well-being. Teachers organise the programme and routines around the children's natural rhythms, interests and care needs. They provide strong role modelling for inclusive and affirming interactions.</p>
<p>Teachers recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s interests in an engaging and attentive manner. However, further opportunities to extend children&rsquo;s learning across different areas could be identified and developed.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h4>About ERO Reviews</h4>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p>
<p>National Evaluation Topics &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p>
<p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
