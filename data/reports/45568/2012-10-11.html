<a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2>
</div><p>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</p><p>Nurture Early Learning Centre is <strong>well placed</strong> to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3><b>Context</b></h3><p>This is the first ERO review of Nurture Early Learning Centre. It is a new privately owned centre operating since November 2010 in a purpose-designed commercial building. The centre provides education and care for children from infants through to school age. Children attend the centre for various lengths of time during the week between the hours of 7 am and 6 pm.</p><p>Children are grouped into four age-related rooms, each with access to an outdoor area. Children move to the next age group at approximately 18 months, two and a half years, and three and a half years. Transitions to the next age group and to school are well managed.</p><p>The centre philosophy acknowledges the individuality of each child. The programme is based on the principles of <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, and influenced by the Reggio Emilia approach to teaching and learning. The development of children&rsquo;s confidence, independence, and an interest in learning are identified as curriculum priorities.</p><p>Centre management is overseen by a representative of an early childhood management company who works with the centre supervisor.</p><p>This relatively new centre is developing well, under effective leadership. The managers are building a reflective and supportive staff culture with a clear focus on providing a high quality education and care service.</p><p>Teachers are respectful of children and are positive and affirming in their interactions. They encourage children to be independent and to develop social skills. Each infant has a teacher who ensures that there is effective communication with their parents/wh&#257;nau. Teachers engage older children in conversations that support their play and promote their thinking.</p><p>The environment is well designed and maintained for the education and care of children. All areas are appropriately resourced with good quality play equipment. Teachers help children access additional resources to extend their play.</p><p>Teachers provide many opportunities for children to learn aspects of M&#257;ori language and culture throughout the programme. Oral language, literacy and numeracy are well supported by activities, resources and discussions. Children have opportunities to be creative. In some rooms children are able to focus on tasks for extended periods of time.</p><p>Good management systems are in place to guide centre operations and to support ongoing improvement. The centre supervisor and centre manager work well together to review all aspects of the education and care of children and the running of the centre. They seek information from parents through surveys and meetings, and receive positive and encouraging feedback from them.</p><p>Performance management supports ongoing improvement. Appraisal is useful to support ongoing improvement. It includes teachers&rsquo; reflections on their practice. Professional development meets the centre&rsquo;s strategic goals and teachers&rsquo; individual goals.</p><p>Centre self-review practices are developing well. Managers and teachers are reflective about centre operations and teaching practices. Managers are clear about what is working well at the centre and have identified areas for development or consolidation.</p><p>Managers and ERO have identified aspects of planning, assessment and evaluation that need strengthening. Learning and teaching would benefit from:</p><ul>
<li>assessment that follows children&rsquo;s interests over time</li>
<li>teachers making closer links between assessment and planning</li>
<li>teachers planning more specifically how they will support the learning of small groups and individuals</li>
<li>programme evaluations that determine the success of planned teacher actions.</li>
</ul><div>
<h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
</div><h4>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h4><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Nurture Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they &nbsp;taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p><span>Click here to enter text.</span></p><div>
<h3>Next Review</h3>
</div><p>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</p><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Makere Smith&nbsp;</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region Acting&nbsp;</p><p>11 October 2012</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3><b>About ERO Reviews</b></h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3><b>Review focus</b></h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3><b>Review Coverage</b></h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p><h3><b>Disclaimer</b></h3><p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p></html>
