</table><p>Talented Tots Early Childhood Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Talented Tots Early Childhood Centre in Glen Eden provides full-day education and care for 40 children, including 12 up to the age of two years. The culturally diverse roll includes small numbers of Māori and Pacific children. Children are catered for in two age-based rooms, with children from three months to approximately three years in the Fantail room, and older children in the Pukeko room.</p><p>The centre is owned and operated by CTA Enterprise Ltd, which owns three other centres in Auckland. Governance and management are the responsibility of the owner, with the assistance of an administrator. An external advisor has been employed by CTA Enterprise Ltd, to support the three centres with many aspects of centre operations. A centre leader has oversight for day-to-day operations.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is consistent with the intentions of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and acknowledges the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. It promotes respectful and caring relationships, partnership with parents, and a rich learning environment to support children’s learning.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report commented positively on teachers' partnerships with parents, the strategic approach to improvement, support for children to transition to school, and for the centre leader and her staff. The report identified areas for improvement, including performance management, internal evaluation, the use of te reo Māori and provision for children with additional learning needs and abilities. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience positive relationships with their teachers and with each other. They have many opportunities to learn in all areas of the curriculum. Their interactions with teachers support their oral language development effectively.</p><p>Each teacher working with children under two years of age has a primary caregiving role for a small group. This approach supports the establishment and maintenance of learning partnerships with children's parents.</p><p>Teachers know children and their families very well. They use a broad range of approaches to talk with parents and discuss their children’s learning. Teachers and parents work together to ensure that transitions into and within the centre, and on to school, are well managed.</p><p>The learning environment is generally well resourced, and children have ready access to the indoor and outdoor areas. The spacious outdoor areas encourage children to engage in physical activity. Children in the younger age group would benefit from easier access to a wider range of resources.</p><p>Good progress has been made to strengthen the assessment of children’s learning and programme planning. Teachers actively seek parents’ aspirations for their children and include these in their learning plans. Improving the ways that they record and share their knowledge of children's cultures and languages, would help all staff to support children in their cultural identity.</p><p>Planning for group learning is thoughtful and supports responsiveness to children's interests. Aspects of te ao Māori are intentionally included. Programme evaluation encourages teachers to consider the effectiveness of plans to enhance children's learning. Teachers could now specifically identify the strategies and activities that they intend to use to extend children's learning.</p><p>Teachers are well supported to improve their practice. The service provider has strengthened the appraisal process and ensures that targeted professional development is well resourced. The external mentor has unpacked <em>Te Whāriki</em> (2017) with the staff, who are now using their new knowledge to inform and reflect on their practice.</p><p>The service provider and staff have a clear vision and shared values that guide decisions related to the curriculum. A policy framework guides centre operations. Some policies and procedures were updated during the course of this review.</p><p>Centre leaders have a strong focus on improvement, and this is supported by a strategic plan that is informed by internal and external evaluation. The managers are exploring how they can strengthen processes for monitoring and evaluating progress towards strategic goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening programme planning by being more specific about the teaching strategies and learning experiences that teachers will use to support the learning of individual children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making more explicit how teachers are working in partnership with whānau to support children's home language and cultural identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regularly evaluating progress towards strategic goals.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Talented Tots Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>24 January 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p><div type="FOOTER">
