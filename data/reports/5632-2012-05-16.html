The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Welcome Bay Kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Tauranga Regional Free Kindergarten Association Inc (TRK) from which it receives governance and administrative support. TRK promotes autonomy for its kindergartens. This model allows each kindergarten to reflect the values of the children, families and community it serves, creating a unique and special place for staff children and wh&#257;nau. This kindergarten currently provides sessional education and care for 71 children, of whom eight are identified as M&#257;ori.</p><p align="left">The head teacher is a knowledgeable and experienced early childhood practitioner. She is a skilled professional leader who values and empowers the experienced teaching team, through a highly effective leadership model.</p><p align="left">In consultation with their community, teachers have identified broad learning dispositions that underpin their philosophy. These are curiosity, relationships, creativity, imagination and innovation, and confidence. These dispositions form the basis of the kindergarten&rsquo;s highly effective curriculum.</p><p align="left">Relationships are central to the leadership of this kindergarten. Teachers know children and their families well and have established respectful, trusting and reciprocal relationships. High priority is given to involving parents in meaningful ways.</p><p align="left">Kindergarten staff have held discussions with local iwi about developing &lsquo;Te Waharoa&rsquo;, the entrance to the centre. These discussions have established genuine relationships that form a sound basis for future partnerships.</p><p align="left">Welcome Bay Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children due to the quality of governance, management, leadership, curriculum design and teaching practice.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive outcomes for children. To reach these findings ERO evaluates:</p><ul>
<li>
<p align="left">Mana Whakahaere &ndash; how governance and management determines the services&rsquo; vision/philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">Pou&#257;rahi &ndash; how the leadership and capability of all involved, including educators, enhances positive outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is implemented to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning reflect diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p align="left">Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of partnerships with wh&#257;nau and self review. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at Welcome Bay Kindergarten</p><h3>How well placed is Welcome Bay Kindergarten to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Welcome Bay Kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Tauranga Regional Free Kindergarten Association Inc from which it receives governance and administrative support. TRK promotes autonomy for its kindergartens within a guiding framework. This model allows each kindergarten to reflect the values of the children, families and community it serves, creating a unique and special place for staff children and wh&#257;nau. The kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy has been developed and recently reviewed by the teaching team. Learning dispositions have been identified and indicators developed. These dispositions are curiosity, relationships, creativity, imagination and innovation, and confidence.</p><h4>Findings</h4><p align="left">Welcome Bay Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children, due to the quality of governance, management, leadership, curriculum design and teaching practice.</p><p align="left">The TRK has clearly defined expectations and provided useful frameworks for self review, professional learning and development, and health and safety systems. The appraisal system is under review, with the aim of making appraisal more effective for teachers. The teaching team has responded positively to the trial appraisal process and made effective use of the relevant professional learning opportunities, through the association and other external agencies.</p><p align="left">The head teacher is a knowledgeable early childhood practitioner. She is a skilled professional leader who values and empowers the experienced teaching team, through a model of highly effective distributive leadership. Their professionalism and reflective practice about teaching and learning allow each teacher to develop their strengths, passions, and address perceived weaknesses. The team receives ongoing professional support, critique and positive challenge from the senior teacher.</p><p align="left">The kindergarten&rsquo;s curriculum is effectively designed to promote positive outcomes for all children. Curriculum priorities are highly visible in displays, learning environments, assessment documentation, teaching interactions and programmes.</p><p align="left">Each teacher has a Kaitiaki role that is significantly influencing curriculum design and implementation. These include:</p><ul>
<li>literacy</li>
<li>numeracy</li>
<li>sustainability</li>
<li>transition to school</li>
<li>Information, communication and technologies (ICT)</li>
<li>Te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori</li>
</ul><p align="left">One of the Kaitiaki roles is focused on developing partnerships and relationships with the parents and wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children. Teachers have worked in consultation with parents and kaumatua from the local marae to design &lsquo;Te Waharoa&rsquo; the entrance that provides a &lsquo;gateway&rsquo; to the kindergarten. This depicts significant features that enable all people to make connections with the area. M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau are assured that their language and culture are valued. During consultation processes, relationships with M&#257;ori have developed and form a genuine basis for future partnerships. In addition, Pacific children and their families enjoy opportunities to share their culture with children and teachers.</p><p align="left">Teachers have identified the need to improve the kindergarten ICT platform to strengthen their ability to respond to children as 21<sup>st</sup> century learners and support continuity of learning beyond the kindergarten.</p><p align="left">Relationships are central to the leadership of this kindergarten. Teachers know children and their families well and have established respectful, trusting and reciprocal relationships. They provide many opportunities for parents to be involved in meaningful ways with their children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p align="left">Teachers skilfully notice, recognise and respond to children&rsquo;s interests, strengths and abilities and develop a responsive programme. There is a careful balance between extending children&rsquo;s interests and how teachers contribute their knowledge, expertise and passions to their learning. It is important for teachers to reflect on this balance to ensure children continue to be empowered to direct their learning.</p><p align="left">Teachers have continued to evolve their assessment, planning and evaluation practices to make this documentation more accessible and meaningful for children and families. Since the previous ERO review they have shifted from electronic portfolios to a &lsquo;Storybook&rsquo; model for documenting children&rsquo;s engagement in the programme and learning. This information is used by teachers to directly inform programme development, resourcing and planning and to evaluate children&rsquo;s learning over time. Parent voice, ideas and aspirations for their children are visible and responded to by teachers. Teachers have identified the need to further consider ways to better reflect children&rsquo;s cultural identity and heritage in storybooks.</p><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Welcome Bay Free Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the course of the review ERO identified an area of non-compliance. In order to address this, centre managers must:</p><ul>
<li>ensure the provision of warm water to the children&rsquo;s and adult bathrooms for hand washing and shower. The association and Ministry of Education have been alerted to this concern.</li>

TRK promotes autonomy for its kindergartens. This model allows each kindergarten to reflect the values of the children, families and community it serves, creating a unique and special place for staff children and wh&#257;nau. This kindergarten currently provides sessional education and care for 71 children, of whom eight are identified as M&#257;ori.</p><p align="left">The head teacher is a knowledgeable and experienced early childhood practitioner. She is a skilled professional leader who values and empowers the experienced teaching team, through a highly effective leadership model.</p><p align="left">In consultation with their community, teachers have identified broad learning dispositions that underpin their philosophy. These are curiosity, relationships, creativity, imagination and innovation, and confidence. These dispositions form the basis of the kindergarten&rsquo;s highly effective curriculum.</p><p align="left">Relationships are central to the leadership of this kindergarten. Teachers know children and their families well and have established respectful, trusting and reciprocal relationships. High priority is given to involving parents in meaningful ways.</p><p align="left">Kindergarten staff have held discussions with local iwi about developing &lsquo;Te Waharoa&rsquo;, the entrance to the centre. These discussions have established genuine relationships that form a sound basis for future partnerships.</p><p align="left">Welcome Bay Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children due to the quality of governance, management, leadership, curriculum design and teaching practice.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><ul>
<li>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</li>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
