<a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Bizzy Buddyz Ltd provides education and care for children from birth to school age, in educarers’ homes. The service is privately owned and operates four networks, three in Whakatane covering the Eastern Bay of Plenty, and one in the Waikato. This network, known informally as Network 1, is based in Whakatane and is overseen by an experienced, qualified visiting teacher, who is responsible for managing the quality of education and care. The service’s programmes are guided by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The owner/director and visiting teacher continue to provide sound governance and management for the service. A notable strength of the network is the positive and trusting relationships among children, educarers, and families, as well as among the visiting teachers across the service. Educarers enjoy working with children and are committed to supporting their wellbeing and development.</p><p>Many children who attend are of Māori descent, and have their cultural identity affirmed and valued through participation in te reo and tikanga Māori, within whānau home environments. Frequent outings in the community and regular attendance at playgroups provide new experiences and opportunities for children and educarers to socialise. Learning programmes effectively promote children’s language development, mathematical knowledge and social competencies. Children are becoming confident, capable learners in a variety of inclusive home environments that provide rich and meaningful contexts for learning.</p><p>The visiting teacher visits homes to provide educarers with useful advice and guidance, and suggest ways to give children relevant additional activities and experiences. Discussions are focused on reviewing the progress and development of each child. Further emphasis on visiting teachers’ professional feedback should strengthen educarers’ knowledge and capability.</p><p>ERO and the service owner/director agree there is a need to strengthen professional leadership in implementing appraisal processes for all staff and developing effective self-review processes. Risks to children’s safety, including heavy items that could fall as the result of an earthquake and exposed electrical sockets need to be addressed promptly.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-the-focus-of-the-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 The Focus of the Review</h2><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Bizzy Buddyz Ltd (Network 1) aims to provide quality childcare and education with positive outcomes for children. Since the last ERO review, the service has grown and moved to new premises. In response to family needs, a 3-4 year old play group has been established to support children’s transition to school. During this review, ERO visited three educarers’ homes and attended a mixed-age play group session.</p><h4>Areas of good performance</h4><p><strong>Management and governance:</strong> The owner/director provides sound management and governance for the service. Educarers are well informed about the service’s high expectations for education and care. There are clear policy and procedural guidelines that promote consistency of practice and draw attention to legislative requirements.</p><p>Bizzy Buddyz Ltd management makes effective use of external providers and external professional development to enhance the programme for children, build visiting teachers’ professional knowledge and develop educarers’ knowledge. At the time of the ERO review, the close working relationship with the Rural Education Activities Programme (REAP) supported children through additional experiences in dance, movement and music.</p><p><strong>Support for educarers:</strong> The visiting teacher provides educarers and parents with advice and support to enhance their respective roles. She is involved in positive learning interactions with children and discussions with educarers that are focused on promoting successful outcomes for children. The visiting teacher organises well-attended playgroups and outings that provide opportunities for children and educarers to socialise and learn. The service arranges visits to marae twice during the year, and also provides parents and educarers with additional resources including access to the Bizzy Buddyz's toy library. Educarers with expertise and skill in te reo and tikanga Māori provide other educarers with ongoing support to implement a bicultural perspective into learning.</p><p><strong>Relationships:</strong> Relationships throughout the service are nurturing and positive. There is mutual trust and respect among visiting teachers, educarers and children. Notable strengths of relationships within the service are:</p><ul>
<li>interactions between educarers and children that foster children’s sense of belonging and wellbeing</li>
<li>individualised and nurturing care routines for babies</li>
<li>small size of groups and high adult-to-child ratios</li>
<li>opportunities for children to explore and pursue their interests in calm, settled home environments</li>
<li>open and responsive communication between educarers and visiting teachers</li>
<li>ongoing communication and sharing of information about children’s learning and development with parents/whānau.</li>
</ul><p>Relationships at all levels of the service support children to develop their social skills and build confidence as capable learners.</p><p><strong>Programme:</strong> Children experience an inclusive programme where they learn in a wide range of family home environments, regular playgroups alongside other children and outings in the local community. Learning programmes effectively promote children’s language development, mathematical knowledge and social competencies. Educarers provide children with a rich variety of activities and experiences, including visits to marae, beach, the library and local parks.</p><p><strong>Home environments:</strong> In the homes visited by ERO, educarers provided interesting, well-organised learning environments. Thoughtful consideration is given to the placing of children in family homes. The aspirations of Māori whānau to have their children learn in a bicultural curriculum are supported through careful placement into appropriate whānau homes. Māori children have their cultural identity affirmed and valued through participation in te reo and tikanga Māori within whānau home environments. Children are confident and experience success in meaningful learning contexts.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>ERO and the service agree there is a need to further strengthen the service’s professional leadership. Particular areas to focus on are to:</p><ul>
<li>implement effective self-review practices including monitoring of possible health and safety hazards in some home environments</li>
<li>implement staff appraisal for all staff</li>
<li>improve the quality of the visiting teachers' documented feedback to educarers to further build their capacity as educators.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Bizzy Buddyz Ltd completed an ERO Home-Based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum standard</li>
<li>premises and facilities standard</li>
<li>health and safety practices standard</li>
<li>governance management and administration standard.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>In order to improve practice, management should implement appraisal processes for all staff.</p><p>The service should ensure that:</p><ol>
<li>heavy furniture, fixtures and equipment that could fall or topple and cause serious image or damage are secured <em>[</em><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS6.]</em></li>
<li>action is taken to eliminate hazards to the safety of children caused by unprotected electrical sockets and appliances. <em>[</em><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, H11]</em></li>
</ol><a id="4-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Recommendation</h2><p>ERO and the service management agree there is a need to access external guidance and development to strengthen professional leadership in self-review and staff-appraisal practices.</p><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>7 April 2014</p><a id="about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Service</h2><table>
