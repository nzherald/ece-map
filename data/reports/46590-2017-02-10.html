</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Morrinsville Kids Ltd is an education and care service located on the outskirts of Morrinsville township. It is licensed to cater for 75 children, including up to 25 children under two years of age. The service opened near the end of 2014. It was developed and is managed by the owners, who both work full time in the service. One of the owners is a very experienced early education teacher and administrator. The service is open from 7am until 5.45pm on week days.</p><p>The centre is organised in four age-group areas, children up to 2 years, 2 year olds, 3 year olds and a separate building and playground caters for 4-year olds. There is a lead teacher for each age group area, and two head teachers are responsible for the day-to-day management of the centre.</p><p>At the time of this ERO review, the roll of 119 children includes 8 Māori, and a small number of children from a diverse range of cultures. Children and families are drawn from a wide geographical area.</p><p>A high proportion of the teachers has a recognised early childhood education qualification.</p><p>The centre philosophy emphasises the importance of:</p><ul>
<li>a warm and friendly environment</li>
<li>recognising, fostering and enhancing children's identity, interests and strengths</li>
<li>capturing the voices of children and parents</li>
<li>the integration of whānau and the wider community.</li>
</ul><p>This review is the first ERO review of the service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle quickly to play in warmly welcoming, inviting leaning environments. They enjoy strong, positive, and responsive relationships with teachers, who know them very well. The four age-group areas are well set up to offer children a wide range of choice, and include appropriate risks and challenges. Children are highly engaged in active play and learning, in both indoor and outdoor play areas.</p><p>Children up to two respond to the secure, calm and predictable environment, which offers them opportunities to explore independently and develop their physical and communication skills. They have a high level of interest in books, and engage in oral and non-verbal communication with teachers and their peers. Babies and toddlers are growing up as confident learners and explorers.</p><p>The learning environments in each area are well-resourced and organised to stimulate children's curiosity and provoke further investigation. Children's physical skills are developing well in playgrounds that are thoughtfully developed, and provide children with opportunities to develop their gross motor skills, be involved in imaginative play, construction and have fun.</p><p>The service's curriculum effectively supports children's literacy skills, with a strong focus on oral language development. Children's ideas and understandings about mathematics are integrated naturally in learning and play. Teachers are undertaking a long-term review of biculturalism in the centre. As a result, they are developing their knowledge and understanding of Māori children, their parents and whānau, and experiences they bring to the service. This ongoing review is contributing to teachers' shared understandings and centre expectations about the bicultural curriculum.</p><p>The centre has established a highly effective and positive approach to managing children's behaviours and social competence. Children are learning to make appropriate choices and developing a sense of care and responsibility for others.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are strong advocates for children and families, especially for those with special needs or circumstances. They seek advice and professional development to understand and meet the needs of these children and support families to access specialist assistance. Displays in the centre show the development of children's interests and their active involvement in sustained projects. Families appreciate the high level of support and flexible approach to hours and days of attendance.</p><p>Teachers plan programmes to respond to children's strengths and interests and take account of parent aspirations. They recognise, record and respond to children's development and progress through detailed learning story assessments. These assessments are shared with parents through termly meetings, individual portfolios and an online interactive website. Teachers also regularly share information with parents at drop-off and collection times.</p><p>Since opening nearly two years ago, leaders have established and maintained an organisational culture of teamwork. They are strongly committed to working in the best interest of children and their families. Their strategic approach to centre development has contributed to strong relationships with parents, and rapid roll growth. Leaders and teachers have undertaken focused professional development to improve their practice and have a well-developed understanding of self review for improvement. Decisions about centre development are based on a breadth of evidence including consideration of relevant research, and the development of an increasingly reflective learning culture among teachers.</p><p>The centre owners are providing strong governance and direction for the service, and a consistent clarity of vision for teachers and whānau. They set high expectations for teachers and leaders, and support them to continually improve their practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre management agree that a valuable next step is to strengthen teacher appraisal by including documented evidence of:</p><ul>
<li>continuing observations of teaching practice including relevant feedback and feedforward, in relation to professional goals, and to the requirements of Educational Council New Zealand</li>
</ul><p>Attention to these aspects of teacher appraisal is likely to provide a more thoroughly documented record of each teachers' professional growth and provide robust evidence about the extent to which each teacher is meeting the practising teacher criteria of the Education Council New Zealand.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Morrinsville Kids Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">Next ERO Review</span></h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Morrinsville Kids Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>10 February 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
