</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Crackerjax Early Learning Centre is a small, privately-owned centre. It provides full-day care and education for up to 42 children from birth-to-school age in a mixed-age setting.</p><p>The leadership team is made up of the owner and manager. Other teachers have leadership roles in the daily running of the centre. There has been stable staffing since ERO's last review in 2013.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have made progress in the areas identified at the time of the previous ERO review. This review recommends the leaders continue to strengthen these developments.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families have a strong sense of belonging to Crackerjax. Teachers provide many interesting experiences and activities that are responsive to the children's home lives and the wider community. Children and teachers make regular visits within the community, including to the local schools. Children are very settled and confident in the centre.</p><p>There are positive and warm friendships between the children. Teachers support children to develop social and independence skills, for example, how to be a good friend. Older children are caring and helpful towards younger children.</p><p>Teachers are intentional in the way they support children's learning. Children benefit from purposeful programmes that are interesting and varied. This includes learning:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>about baking, gardening and a variety of vegetables</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>through enjoyable small group experiences and routines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>early mathematics and literacy through their play.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children have opportunities to hear and use te reo Māori through singing waiata and hearing legends. Teachers are respectful of tikanga Māori in their practices throughout the centre for all children.</p><p>Teachers effectively support the learning and wellbeing of infants and toddlers. They:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>have nurturing and caring relationships with the children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>work with parents as they settle their children into the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make caregiving an integral part of learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>foster learning by using appropriate strategies that are appropriate to the needs of each infant.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers have developed common understandings of what the centre's philosophy looks like in practice. The philosophy will more usefully guide teaching when it has a greater focus on what are considered the centre's specific, valued learning outcomes. Leaders are yet to evaluate the effectiveness of practices and programmes in meeting the philosophy.</p><p>Teachers consistently use the centre's framework for group and individual planning. They gather the perspectives of children and the parents' wishes when planning for children's learning. In the best examples of children's records, teachers show how these are responded to. Elements of best assessment practice are evident in children's records. Teachers now need to ensure all records consistently show all elements of effective assessment, planning and evaluation. This includes, but is not limited to, clearly showing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>how teachers and parents together develop next steps for children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the experiences and strategies planned to support learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children's progress over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how teachers value and respond to children's cultural and social backgrounds.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers sensitively work with children who need additional help with their learning. Transitions into the centre and on to school are carefully planned for all children.</p><p>Centre leaders are committed to ongoing improvement. This is evident in the:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>identification of centre-wide development priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>purposeful professional learning and development for all staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>inclusion of goals in each teacher's appraisal that align with the centre development priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders recognise the need to align evaluation with this planning.</p><p>Although the leaders have identified development priorities within their strategic plan, there are no actions documented to show how the priorities will be met.</p><p>Leaders have worked on building their understanding of evaluation and developments coming from the evaluation findings.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders need to continue to strengthen and refine:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the centre philosophy to include the centre's valued learning outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assessment, planning and evaluation for children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aspects of evaluation (self review) including the development of an evaluative question and indicators to guide the investigative focus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the strategic plan.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Crackerjax Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Crackerjax Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>3 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
