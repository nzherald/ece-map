</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Greenhithe Kindergarten provides education and care for up to 30 children over two years old. Most children attend morning and afternoon sessions. Some children attend for mornings only. The kindergarten is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA) and operates within the policies and management framework of this organisation. A professional services manager (PSM) provides management and curriculum support for teachers. The AKA has high expectations that teachers will provide a bicultural programme.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy places high value on relationships and aims to nurture children&rsquo;s positive attitudes towards learning. The centre&rsquo;s curriculum is underpinned by <em>Te Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Since the centre adopted a Kindergarten Day Model (KDM) in October 2013, there have been changes in staff, including the creation of an extra teacher position. The head teacher was appointed in May 2013. Recently, two new teachers have joined her. A part-time administrator, a teaching assistant and a teacher aide support them. The kindergarten&rsquo;s parent committee supports the centre by being actively involved in fundraising and social events.</p><p>The kindergarten&rsquo;s 2012 ERO report noted the programme, learning environment and the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) were strengths. The report identified bicultural practice, learning partnerships with parents and records of children&rsquo;s learning as areas for development. Much progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers support children&rsquo;s development by building on their ideas. This relationship contributes to children being confident and socially competent learners. Children interact positively with each other and with adults, and collaboratively plan their play. They are warmly welcomed by staff and quickly settle to their routines. They have opportunities to explore and choose from a wide variety of activities. They have a strong sense of belonging to the centre. The well developed garden and inviting environment supports children&rsquo;s curiosity about the natural world.</p><p>Teachers&rsquo; very good knowledge of children and their families is evident in programme planning. They use external agencies to support children with diverse and special learning needs. Teachers enhance children&rsquo;s interests and extend their knowledge. Children have opportunities to participate in rich literacy and science experiences.</p><p>The curriculum promotes respectful, responsive relationships. As a result of review, and in response to a recommendation from the 2012 ERO review, bicultural practices are now more embedded in the centre&rsquo;s programme. M&#257;ori children are well supported in their learning, and teachers increasingly use te reo M&#257;ori during the daily programme. Tikanga M&#257;ori is evident in the way M&#257;ori concepts, and the use of waiata and karakia are promoted by staff.</p><p>Teachers use a variety of strategies to deepen children&rsquo;s thinking and exploration of the world around them. A newly introduced teaching technique for capturing children&rsquo;s knowledge and views has further strengthened the centre&rsquo;s responsive curriculum. Teachers have refined ways they support and build on children&rsquo;s ideas. They record children&rsquo;s contributions in a variety of formats. Wall displays and children&rsquo;s learning portfolios have been modified to better inform parents about their children&rsquo;s learning and progress. As a result, parents are better able to complement teachers&rsquo; work by supporting and extending their children&rsquo;s interests at home.</p><p>Self review is well established and informs centre planning. Teachers have identified that they would like to continue to enhance self review by evaluating the impact their teaching practices have on outcomes for children. Parents report that they have increasing opportunities to contribute to centre direction. A review of children&rsquo;s transitions and portfolios has included input from parents. Teachers have used information collected to make positive changes to centre procedures and their teaching practices.</p><p>The Auckland Kindergarten Association continues to promote positive strategies which include professional learning and development that strengthens teachers&rsquo; skills, knowledge and practice. Distributed leadership and sharing of expertise among kindergarten teaching teams are also promoted. The sharing of knowledge and expertise within the association is encouraged. Association leaders are currently reviewing the appraisal process and continue to explore appropriate ways to support teachers to deliver high quality outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers, the PSM and ERO agree that key next steps for the kindergarten should include teachers:</p><ul>
<li>enhancing self-review processes</li>
<li>exploring ways mat times can be improved</li>
<li>having more discussions with parents about children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>continuing to explore ways they can support and promote children&rsquo;s mathematical thinking.</li>
</ul><p>ERO is confident that the kindergarten has the capacity and capability through its high quality leadership and effective long-term planning to sustain its successful development.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Greenhithe Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Greenhithe Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>4 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
