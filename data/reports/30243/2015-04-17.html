</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids on Broadway is located in Matamata and caters for families from the town and surrounding farming district. The centre operates under the umbrella of Matamata Childcare, a non-profit incorporated society. It is licensed to provide all-day education and care for up to 25 children over the age of two years. Currently 43 children are on the roll, and five children identify as Māori.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2012 management and teaching staff have remained largely the same. The centre exceeds Ministry of Education expectations for qualified and registered teachers. Teachers have made good progress with the areas for development identified in the 2012 report related to self review, strategic planning, appraisal and routines. Since the onsite review visit, the legal structure of the governance body has changed to offer a more sustainable approach.</p><p>Teachers aim to provide quality education and care in a learning environment filled with love, respect and kindness. They endeavour to incorporate aspects of sustainability and the Reggio and Pickler philosophies into the programme and environment.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from a well-planned programme that includes a good balance of child-initiated and teacher-led experiences. Their curiosity is fostered through informative centre displays, imaginatively presented areas for exploration, and many opportunities to experience the natural world in meaningful contexts. The environment promotes learning. Children are able to freely choose from a wide variety of good quality equipment and materials that reflect the teachers’ focus on sustainability.</p><p>Imaginary and creative play is highly valued by teachers, and children demonstrate emergent leadership as they take on roles and make rules for their play. Children are skilled at socialising in a mixed-age setting and with their siblings. They confidently express ideas and opinions, make choices, and share their enthusiasm for learning with responsive, respectful teachers. Routines support children to sustain their play for long periods of time.</p><p>Māori children and their families appreciate the way their culture is valued and evident in the environment and equipment. Teachers place an emphasis on caring for Papatuanuku and the natural world. Some teachers confidently use appropriate te reo Māori and tikanga practices are respectfully followed. Teachers and children have been welcomed on to local marae. Current self review is focused on continuing to strengthen this area of the curriculum. Teachers are currently involved in researching the places and stories of local tribal significance.</p><p>Recently introduced e-portfolios and well-presented individual portfolios and centre displays enable children and families to celebrate and revisit their learning and development together. These records would be enhanced by including recognition of each child’s family/whānau, language, culture and identity.</p><p>Teachers are reflective practitioners. They are enthusiastic about professional development and frequently share their learning and research. Professional partnerships with specialist agencies have been established and promote positive outcomes for children and their families. Teachers work collaboratively with families to build on the strengths and capabilities of children with identified special needs. High-quality teaching practice observed by ERO includes:</p><ul>
<li>a long-standing commitment to, and knowledge of, the local community and families/whānau</li>
<li>noticing and responding to children’s strengths and interests, and using this information effectively to extend children’s learning and development</li>
<li>the skilful integration of early concepts of mathematics and literacy into learning conversations and children’s play</li>
<li>warm and affectionate interactions that contribute to a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing for children and families</li>
<li>high levels of inclusiveness that benefit children and their families.</li>
</ul><p>The centre manager is a skilled and knowledgeable leader in early childhood education. She has a thorough understanding of governance and currently undertakes many of the roles assigned to the executive committee. The experienced leadership team continue to provide highly effective centre leadership. They have maintained a collaborative and collegial team over many years. Recent professional development in self review has resulted in ongoing centre development and improvement. Matters of privacy and confidentiality are well managed and understood.</p><p>Centre leaders should now consider strengthening teacher appraisal by including:</p><ul>
<li>a system for monitoring progress through the year in line with individual teacher goals</li>
<li>observations as a regular part of the process to further inform feedback and feed forward against agreed and shared indicators of best teaching practice in early childhood education.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree with the need to monitor and review the impact of the recent changes to the governance model to ensure positive outcomes for staff, children and their families and whānau.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids on Broadway completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids on Broadway will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>17 April 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
