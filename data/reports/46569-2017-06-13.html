</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Preschoolers is an early learning centre located in Glenview, Hamilton. This mixed-age service is licensed for 29 children including 10 children under two years of age. At the time of this review there were 40 children enrolled, including 26 Māori. Centre operating hours are from 7.30 am to 6.00 pm, Monday to Friday. Little Preschoolers is a stand-alone service owned and operated by four directors who are whānau. Staffing has been consistent and stable since the opening of the centre in 2014. Management and leadership work alongside each other to provide future direction for the centre.</p><p>The centre's vision is to provide a 'home away from home experience' and inclusive and equitable learning opportunities for all children. Tikanga and te reo Māori is embraced in the daily programme. Values such as ako, manaakitanga, whanaungatanga and tuakana-teina are reflected in the philosophy and programme.</p><p>This is the centre's first Education Review Office (ERO) evaluation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers' value whakawhanaungatanga and building strong relational trust with children and their whānau. Principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi are evident throughout the learning programme and incorporated in teaching practice. Whānau and parents are invited to share their aspirations, expertise, knowledge and concerns for their children through kanohi-ki-te-kanohi, a whānau feedback book, and online portfolio portals. Whānau and parents are informed about children's progress, strengths and dispositions, and are also provided with next steps in their child's learning through individual portfolios and learning stories. This is building positive learning partnerships with parents and whānau to improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The tuakana-teina based learning programme allows children to lead their own learning, and builds social and emotional competency skills as they learn alongside one another. Teachers take the time to listen to children and show care and manaakitanga as they foster each child's holistic wellbeing. Children experience a bicultural environment and are confident in te ao Māori. They enjoy expressing themselves through kapahaka, waiata, tohutohu, dance and storytelling. They experience the narratives of their own and other cultures, including Pacific, and are confident in discovering different ways to be creative through art, dramatic play, and music. Teachers support children from a number of cultural backgrounds and value the practice of ako, reciprocal learning, to foster children's identity, language and culture.</p><p>Children are encouraged to explore their natural world around them with a designated science area and animal life cycles investigation and display. The spacious homely learning area allows children to access all centre activities. ERO and leaders agree that encouraging children to follow their interests, and strengthening the intentional teaching practice, will engage and extend children's learning and language development.</p><p>Transitions into the centre are managed well. A 'getting ready for school' programme builds on their numeracy and literacy skills, social confidence, and independence. Routines are consistently implemented giving children security and a strong sense of belonging. As a new centre, it would be timely to consult with whānau, kaiako and children to review and document the curriculum to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>reflect the bicultural and bilingual aspects of the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the learning programme for infants and toddler to cater for their rapidly growing capabilities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>A special feature of the centre is the strength in leadership as a whānau, for whānau whānui. All members are well respected and have established links to their community. The passionate manager and leadership team work collaboratively together, and have established systems and processes to run day-to-day operations aligned to the centre vision and strategic plan. Policies and procedures are scheduled and are being kept up-to-date. Leaders access external professional learning and development and have now developed a system for ongoing self review. A performance management system is in place and contributes to the service achieving its vision and goals. There are good examples of teachers' reflecting on their practice as they work towards building their capabilities as teachers. There is a need for leaders of learning to continue to strengthen the appraisal process and build professional capabilities through regular opportunities to model best practice, undertake peer observations, and provide feedback on effective teaching and learning.</p><p>Leadership is committed to continuing to improve future development for equitable outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders now need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>consult with the community to review and document the curriculum, including the programme for babies and toddlers, to incorporate and reflect more of the centre's vision and values</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the performance management system to continue to build teacher capability. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Preschoolers completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Little Preschoolers will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>13 June 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
