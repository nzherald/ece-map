</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Papamoa Playcentre is located in Papamoa, near Tauranga. It is licensed to cater for 30 children including 15 up to the age of two years. The roll at the time of this ERO review was 68 children, including 16 who identify as Māori.</p><p>The centre provides four, mixed-age sessions each week, as well as two extension sessions with paid kaiako that older children can attend without their parents. The Supporting Parents Alongside Children’s Education (SPACE) initiative provides three sessions each week to support mothers and babies up to one year of age.</p><p>During 2018 playcentres are transitioning from operating as The New Zealand Playcentre Federation (NZPF) with 32 regional associations to a national organisation with six offices. In the central North Island eight associations have merged into a regional hub renamed Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island. This region includes 95 playcentres spread over a large geographic area. During the organisation transition there is some overlap between association systems and new national approaches. At the time of this ERO review there is some uncertainty as new processes become established.</p><p>The governance management structure consists of a regional manager and a centre support coordinator who provide guidance and management for the playcentres. A centre administrator and centre support worker were appointed in early 2018 to provide support and guidance for centre operations. A national professional learning and development team is in the early stages of planning for additional learning support to build members’ capability as first teachers of their children. Responsibility for centre leadership is shared across centre members. A high proportion of members is in training, and a number hold higher level playcentre qualifications.</p><p>The centre aims to recognise Te Tiriti o Waitangi and share tikanga and te reo Māori with tamariki. Members value child-initiated free play in a mixed-age setting where adults guide and model positive social interactions. The playcentre supports children and adults to learn alongside and with each other.</p><p>The centre has a positive ERO reporting history. Significant progress has been made with areas for development identified in the 2015 ERO report. These related to strengthening strategic planning and self review, improving the place of te reo and tikanga Māori and using observations as the basis to further inform planning for children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six playcentres in the Western Bay of Plenty under the governance of Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A shared approach is resulting in effective leadership. In the centre there are clearly documented roles and responsibilities. Succession planning is well managed and contributes to ongoing, sustainable centre operations. Members set clear strategic direction for the centre. Effective internal evaluation processes lead to ongoing development and improvement. Members have established and maintained a culture where children and whānau are first and foremost valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning.</p><p>Children experience a curriculum that strongly links to their home experiences, and responds to their strengths and interests. The local curriculum is well designed and integrates the knowledge, skills and aspirations of adults to enrich outcomes for children. The centre responds to older children through extension sessions led by suitably qualified kaiako. Babies benefit from being in the presence of their primary caregivers at all times. Diverse learners benefit from the partnership of kaiako and parents with a focus on their particular needs.</p><p>The curriculum is regularly planned, assessed and evaluated and maximises the potential of the local environment. Members should now consider ways to further document and celebrate the language, culture and identity of all children attending this centre. Parents have established a richly resourced, well presented and maintained, stimulating learning environment for children.</p><p>Māori children and their whānau are affirmed in their culture and empowered to make decisions that promote positive outcomes for their learning. Māori members expressed appreciation for the way te ao Māori is naturally included in the programme. There are knowledgeable role models in the centre who are responsive to Māori children’s wellbeing and belonging, and build the understanding of other members. These positive apsects are promoting equity, excellence and success for Māori as Māori at Papamoa Playcentre.</p><p>Positive transitions contribute to a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing for children and their families. Communication systems and displays keep members well informed about centre operations and events and celebrate the success of members in training. Whānau reported that children going on to school experience success as confident learners.</p><p>Affirming relationships and responsive interactions with adults are contributing to positive learning outcomes for children. Adults are actively involved, playing with and alongside children and supporting them to develop their early understanding of literacy, mathematics and science concepts. Children at the centre benefit from teaching practices implemented by adults who know them well and have their best interests at heart.</p><p>Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island is in the early stages of providing support for centres during a time of transition. Existing polices and systems are supporting centre operations until new systems developed by Playcentre Aotearoa are implemented. The strategic and annual plans are yet to consistently guide regional and centre direction. A particular strength of the playcentre is the two-house model initiative for governance. Te Whare Tikanga Māori promotes self-determination for Māori members through regular hui and targeted funding, and enacts the partnership aspect of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified the need for Playcentre Aotearoa Central North Island management to develop:</p><ul>
<li><em>more robust quality assurance processes for internal evaluation practice and reporting systems to inform priorities, future direction and provide targeted support for its playcentres</em></li>
<li>a strategic approach to professional development in relation to <em>Te Whāriki</em>2017.</li>
</ul><p>Playcentre members' next steps for ongoing development are to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen internal evaluation by more clearly documenting evidence of the outcomes of strategic and annual planning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Papamoa Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Action for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance related to appraisal.</p><p>The current appraisal process of employed staff does not meet Ministry of Education regulatory requirements. Governance needs to ensure suitable human resource management practices are developed, documented and implemented.</p><p><i>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7.]</i></p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Papamoa Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>29 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
