</table><p>The centre needs further support to improve programmes for children, develop sustainable effective self review systems and strengthen leadership capacity.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kauri Kids Clendon is a community-based centre run by a governing board/committee under the umbrella of the Auckland City Council. The centre is licensed to provide care and education for 50 children, including 12 infants and toddlers up to the age of two years. The families enrolled come from diverse backgrounds and cultures.</p><p>The centre’s roll fluctuates considerably and the centre finds it a challenge to maintain the roll to full licence capacity.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO report the centre has had a name change from Clendon Community Centre to Kauri Kids Clendon. The 2012 report identified the progress made in improving the quality of learning, planning and assessment, and noted how successful team building had supported staff to develop a shared understanding about good practice. The teachers have maintained some improvements, but limited progress has been made since the last ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and actively participate in the activities teachers provide. They make decisions about their play and play cooperatively with and alongside their friends. Children independently access resources and make choices for their play. Teachers promote inclusion and support children to develop social skills.</p><p>Relationships with parents and whānau are responsive, reciprocal and respectful, giving children a strong sense of belonging. Children are welcoming and caring toward each other and adults.</p><p>Infants and toddlers have a separate room for uninterrupted play and exploration. They have individualised timetables that meet their needs and their experiences are recorded by teachers during their time in the centre. The teachers in this room are affectionate and caring. They are building their capacity to promote further exploration and language development opportunities for children. A more stimulating and developmentally appropriate programme for infants and toddlers would help to achieve this.</p><p>The learning environment is well established and allows for indoor and outdoor play. The large outdoor playground is well utilised and popular with children. However, the centre is in need of a good clean and fresh paint. Resources require renewal. The centre needs to provide a wider variety of good quality resources to help challenge children more in their play.</p><p>Teachers are developing programmes that follow children’s interests and are aligned to <em>Te Whariki</em> the early childhood curriculum. They should now consider more effective ways to integrate mathematics, literacy, science and technology throughout the programme.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre Managers agree that to improve outcomes for children, teachers will need to:</p><ul>
<li>source external support to increase their understanding of current early childhood educational theories and practice</li>
<li>develop a systematic approach to planning and assessing children’s progress and learning over time</li>
<li>develop robust self-review processes that evaluate their successes in supporting children's learning</li>
<li>work collaboratively to develop a shared understanding of the centre’s philosophy and of effective teaching practice.</li>
</ul><p>The governance board and manager recognise that they must act with urgency to:</p><ul>
<li>support centre leaders to build their leadership capacity</li>
<li>implement the newly developed appraisal process for teachers</li>
<li>develop the centre’s strategic and annual plans in consultation with teachers and parents, and to formally document key actions that meet the centre’s desired outcomes.</li>
</ul><h3><span>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</span></h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kauri Kids Clendon completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3><span>Actions for compliance</span></h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to the quality of the curriculum, shared leadership and effective self review. To meet requirements the centre must:</p><ul>
<li>plan programmes that are more clearly responsive to children’s individual interests and strengths</li>
<li>establish more formal and regular self-review practices to support ongoing improvement and more sustainable good practice.</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C, 2, GMA,6.</em></p><p>The service is not meeting its Equity Funding reporting requirements. In order to address this, the board must report to parents and the local community about how they have spent their Equity Funding. The report must be included in the service’s annual report for presentation at its annual general meeting <em>[Early Childhood Funding Handbook – Charter 10, Equity Funding].</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the centre, in consultation with the governance board and the Ministry of Education, develop a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kauri Kids Clendon will be within two years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern Select Region</p><p>2 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
