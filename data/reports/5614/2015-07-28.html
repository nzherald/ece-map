</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Katikati Free Kindergarten is located in the rural township of Katikati and is on an attractive and well-presented site, adjacent to an extensive park and playing fields. It is licensed for 30 children over two years of age. Currently 39 children are attending, including seven who identify as Māori. It provides an all-day programme from 8.30am to 2.30pm from Monday to Thursday, and from 8.30am until 12.45pm on Friday.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO review the kindergarten and community have continued to benefit from the strong leadership of an experienced head teacher and a long serving team of teachers. A recent initiative is the appointment of a fourth teacher in a job sharing role. All four teachers are qualified and registered teachers. The kindergarten is supported by a committee of active parents and enjoys the support of the wider community. Central to the kindergarten’s philosophy is the belief that the environment is instrumental in advancing children’s learning. The programme supports children to learn about the natural world, sustainable conservation and healthy eating. The kindergarten provides a safe, welcoming, fun and stimulating environment where learning is encouraged through nurturing, creativity and play.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of Tauranga Regional Kindergartens (TRK), which is an early childhood education service, governed by a board of parent-elected community representatives. Senior teachers oversee and support the professional work of the kindergarten. This work is supplemented by a Resource Teacher Māori who provides professional learning and support for TRK staff in te ao Māori.</p><p>The association sets the strategic direction of its kindergartens, placing emphasis on nurturing reciprocal relationships with whānau and communities, educating for sustainability, meeting community needs and honouring the Treaty of Waitangi. It provides kindergarten staff with clear guidelines and expectations for practice. There is a good range of self-review practices to monitor and evaluate the quality of education and care provided by its kindergartens.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five kindergarten reviews in the Tauranga Regional Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children feel welcome and included and have high levels of trusting relationships with teachers and one another. They demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and a willingness to share their ideas and interests. The natural and challenging environment is well prepared to provide a rich variety of experiences. Children play and explore in the outdoor area, using their imagination and creativity in pursuing their interests. Oral language, literacy, mathematics, science and nature are naturally integrated into the programme.</p><p>A strong feature of the programme is that teachers make the environment a particular focus for children’s learning. Children are encouraged to learn about the natural world, sustainable conservation and healthy eating. Many aspects of the kindergarten environment support this focus with children involved in water conservation, rubbish recycling and worm farming. Children are actively involved in community projects such as Kati KaiWay where they help to plant and maintain fruit trees in a local reserve. They experience a sense of wellbeing as they discover the world of nature and develop responsible attitudes as guardians of the environment. This has been recognised by the kindergarten being awarded Green/Gold Status by the <em>Enviroschools</em> Foundation of New Zealand.</p><p>All children and their families are welcomed into the kindergarten. Children are understood as unique learners and are accepted and celebrated for who they are. Teachers are culturally responsive and support the identity and culture of each child. Te reo and tikanga Māori practices are well integrated into the programme in authentic contexts. The concepts of whanaungatanga, manaakitanga and kaitiakitanga are included in the programmes. All parents spoken to by ERO, including several Māori and Pacific parents, are pleased with the way the individuality and identity of their children’s culture are celebrated and fostered.</p><p>Children learn through play and are well supported to follow their interests, solve problems, and take responsible risks by teachers. They know children well, and spend time with them, supporting their engagement in self-initiated, sustained play. In addition, teachers notice, recognise and extend learning opportunities for children. Open-ended questions are used to prompt children’s thinking. Children are developing independence and are being supported to take increasing responsibility for their own learning and well being. Teachers are particularly skilled in supporting children with additional learning needs. Together with parents and external agencies, they work to identify areas for development and share useful skills and approaches to support children.</p><p>Programme planning uses ideas from children’s individual interests, as well as a balance of emergent interests, which respond to individual's fascination with a chosen subject. Recent interests have focused on insects, dinosaurs and volcanoes. An important part of planning is the fund of knowledge that children bring with them to kindergarten and share with others at mat time. Their interests, learning and progress are recorded in attractive individual portfolio books, and parents and children enjoy reading and sharing these books. Recently an on-line portfolio has been made available for families to contribute to. Parents value the opportunities this provides for them and others to share in their children’s learning, and respond with ideas and information to encourage further learning.</p><p>Children benefit from highly effective transition procedures to support them on entering the kindergarten or for entry to school. Procedures include visits, liaison with schools, sharing of information and support for parents. A feature of the transition procedures are informative pamphlets that compare how things are done at kindergarten with what happens at each school that children might attend.</p><p>The knowledgeable and experienced head teacher provides strong collaborative leadership to the teaching team. She empowers teachers to use their strengths and interests to take on leadership roles. The team shares a commitment to beliefs and values about children’s learning and wellbeing, and care and respect for the environment. These values underpin teaching. Team members are reflective practitioners who use self review to continually enhance their teaching practice.</p><p>Teachers have been involved in effective professional development and learning that has promoted enthusiasm, increased their confidence, and engagement in learning and teaching. Currently teachers are working on two main areas identified through self review. These are developing effective care and teaching strategies for children under three, and identifying the best ways to use information and communication technologies in kindergarten programmes to benefit children. The kindergarten is well supported in its operation and development by the association’s senior teacher.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the kindergarten have identified that the teaching team should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>reflect on and refine strategies to include the diversity of needs of younger and older children</li>
<li>investigate appropriate ways of using information and communication technologies as an educational tool with children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Katikati Free Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Katikati Free Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>28 July 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2.

General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework<a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"> Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
