</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Harbourside Kids Childcare Centre is located in the grounds of the Harbourside Church. The centre has a Christian based philosophy with a strong emphasis on family and community. It provides full day and part-time education and care services for children up to five years of age. Two separate areas cater for infants and toddlers, and for older children. Since the 2012 ERO report, the separate licences for infants and toddlers, and preschool children have been merged into one licence.</p><p>The centre is run by a charitable trust. A governance board oversees financial aspects of centre operations. Day-to-day management of the centre is the responsibility of the senior teacher. Eighty percent of staff members are qualified, registered teachers.</p><p>ERO’s previous report in 2012 recommended that staff continue designing a curriculum that balances teacher led and child initiated programmes. Significant progress has been made in this area. Teachers’ participation in professional development has supported very good improvements to programme planning systems and the assessment of children’s learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children demonstrate a good sense of wellbeing and belonging. Infants and toddlers receive individualised care and attention in a nurturing environment. They are confident to explore and communicate with a variety of adults. Plans to add more shade to the outdoors will enable teachers to further increase the outdoor experiences for younger children.</p><p>Older children engage in imaginative and co-operative play for long periods of time. They confidently share their ideas with teachers and other children. They have opportunities to be leaders and to support and mentor their peers. Teachers are responsive to children’s interests. They skilfully ask questions that encourage children to share their thinking and ideas. Teachers use te reo Māori in meaningful ways that allow children to understand and respond.</p><p>Staff identify that it is timely to review how well the programme provides for two-year-old children, including the length of mat times. They also recognise that strategies to manage children’s behaviour need to reflect the centre’s positive guidance policy.</p><p>Whole team professional development has significantly improved programme planning and assessment systems. Parent/teacher interviews enable teachers to find out about the aspirations that parents have for their child’s learning. Children’s strengths, interests and participation in the programme are clearly shown in attractive learning records. Teachers skilfully identify the learning that happens in the context of children’s play. It could be useful for teachers to refine the way they evaluate group programmes to more consistently focus on improved learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The teaching team has worked to develop shared understandings about teaching practices. Team building has been a focus as the roll has grown and new staff employed. Well developed self-review systems enable teachers to identify areas for improvement. This is helping teachers to make positive changes that enhance children’s experiences at the centre. The teaching team is looking at ways to more effectively gather and use feedback from families to improve centre practices.</p><p>The board has developed a clear business plan. It details operational goals and future plans for the centre. The board could further improve the way it makes resourcing decisions by having teachers develop long-term goals that focus on educational improvements.</p><p>Leaders agree that a review of the teacher appraisal process is a priority. Teacher appraisals should be aligned to the registered teacher criteria. A useful approach could be for teachers to revisit their appraisal goals regularly and evaluate the progress they are making towards achieving them. The board needs to ensure that the senior teacher is appraised annually.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The board chair and senior teacher agree that useful and key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>improving the quality of teacher appraisal systems</li>
<li>developing long-term educational goals to guide ongoing improvement</li>
<li>accessing and using resources to further promote success for Māori and Pacific learners.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Harbourside Kids Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Harbourside Kids Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>13 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
