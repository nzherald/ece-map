</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bellevue Kindergarten is a community-based centre situated near to Bellevue School in Newlands, Wellington.</p><p>It is one of 85 kindergartens and three home-based education and care networks governed and managed by He Wh&#257;nau Manaaki o Tararua Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). This is a new kindergarten association created from joining the Rimutaka and Wellington Kindergarten Associations in 2014. The transition to the new association is expected to be a three-year process.</p><p>The board and managers provide governance for the organisation. Senior teachers have delegated kindergartens. Their role is to provide regular support and a range of professional learning and development opportunities for teachers.</p><p>All teachers at Bellevue Kindergarten are qualified and registered. Some have many years' experience at the kindergarten including the head teacher.</p><p>Since the June 2012 ERO report, the outdoor environment has been further developed.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises the importance of providing a warm, welcoming environment for all, recognising children as individuals, and strong relationships with children and their families.</p><p>The previous ERO report for Bellevue Kindergarten identified that at a centre level, assessment and use of te reo M&#257;ori needed further development. Areas where the Wellington Kindergarten Association needed to strengthen its support for teachers were also identified. Improvement continues to be needed in some of these areas that the association has plans to address. These feature as key next steps in this report. The alignment of individual kindergartens' annual plans with the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities has now been addressed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 12 kindergarten reviews in He Wh&#257;nau Manaaki Kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children show a positive sense of belonging. They are confident to approach others and share their ideas. They have opportunities for sustained play. Parents are made to feel welcome. Their involvement in the programme is valued. Children&rsquo;s independence and self-help skills are promoted. They are encouraged to take care of themselves, others, and the environment.</p><p>Relationships are positive and responsive. A sense of fun is evident. Children with additional learning needs are well supported in the programme.</p><p>The environment is inviting and purposefully promotes literacy experiences. Other features of the programme include an emphasis on art, music and physical skills.</p><p>Reciprocal links with the local school help to support children and their families as they transition to school.</p><p>Recent developments to planning are making learning in the programme more visible for children and their families. The head teacher acknowledges that building on this process to more clearly identify what is working, why and who for, is a next step. ERO's evaluation affirms this direction.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s profile books are an attractive record of their participation and involvement in kindergarten experiences and activities. The head teacher has appropriately identified that some aspects of assessment require improvement.</p><p>Teachers have made solid progress in developing self review. Next steps in strengthening aspects of review and evaluation to guide improvement and sustain best practice are to:</p><ul>
<li>extend the use of success criteria using current and best practice in early childhood education</li>
<li>deepen the analysis of the information gathered.</li>
</ul><p>The 2012 ERO report identified that the association needed to improve the appraisal processes. These continue to require development. A recently revised appraisal model, yet to be implemented, includes: more focused goals that build teacher and leader capability; more regular and targeted feedback and feed forward about teaching practice; and clearer links with the Registered Teacher Criteria.</p><p>The senior teacher provides termly written reports that outline agreed development priorities and progress in the quality of teaching and learning. The association has recently implemented new reports that should more deliberately focus on outcomes for children, teacher and leader performance. ERO's evaluation affirms this development.</p><p>In 2012, the association developed a framework to guide the implementation of its curriculum, Te Manawa. This document outlines criteria for curriculum delivery including expectations for assessment and planning for children&rsquo;s learning. The curriculum is increasingly responding to and promoting successful outcomes for all learners.</p><p>Children have some opportunities to learn about Aotearoa New Zealand&rsquo;s dual cultural heritage. Teachers should enhance their responsiveness to M&#257;ori children's language, culture and identity by strengthening relationships with mana whenua and further accessing professional readings and development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher, head teacher, staff and ERO agree on the following key next steps. Kindergarten personnel will:</p><ul>
<li>deepen understanding of self review and evaluation</li>
<li>further strengthen aspects of assessment and programme planning</li>
<li>extend the bicultural curriculum for all learners</li>
<li>promote ways for M&#257;ori to achieve success as M&#257;ori, and Pacific learners to achieve success as Pacific.</li>
</ul><p>The senior management team of He Wh&#257;nau Manaaki o Tararua should continue to further improve processes for growing and developing the practice of teachers, head teachers and the senior teacher. This should include:</p><ul>
<li>improvements to the quality and monitoring of processes to support individual kindergartens and regular implementation of a robust appraisal system.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bellevue Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bellevue Kindergarten will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>9 June 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>
