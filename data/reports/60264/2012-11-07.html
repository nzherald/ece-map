<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2>
<p>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</p>
<p>Oxford St Community Kindy is developing its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Oxford Street Community Kindy, previously called Early Years Oxford, is situated in Tawa, Wellington. It is owned and operated by Kidicorp. Due to falling rolls and a change in community needs, a decision was made to change the focus of the service. In August 2012, the centre name was changed and the programme and environment adapted to cater specifically for three and fouryearold children. Options are available for them to enrol for a full day, or sessionally for mornings or afternoons. Staff and parents were consulted about the changes. As a result of a recent restructure the team is in a transition phase of strengthening practices, developing a team culture and enhancing the environment to support young children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p>Clear systems and regular visits and reports from the professional services manager (PSM) and business manager provide ongoing support, professional advice and guidance, and monitoring of children&rsquo;s health and safety. Day-to-day management and responsibility for the programme is delegated to the centre manager and head teacher.</p>
<p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in four early childhood education services within the Kidicorp umbrella organisation.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children learn and play in an inclusive, calm and positive atmosphere. They are settled, cooperative and enthusiastic participants. Teachers are respectful and empower them through learning. They show genuine interest in children, listening carefully to their ideas and joining in meaningful shared conversations. Children&rsquo;s accomplishments are celebrated and their home languages used.</p>
<p>The learning environment is inviting and well organised with a good flow. Children confidently access materials and resources to support their play interests. Gardens provide authentic learning experiences. Carefully considered displays celebrate children&rsquo;s work and interests and make the programme visible to families, staff and children.</p>
<p>Assessment, planning and evaluation practice is developing, with progress evident. The programme is appropriately planned from children&rsquo;s interests with their ideas and family contributions included. Children&rsquo;s profiles contain regular entries that identify learning dispositions, reflect their culture and include parent comment about the stories.</p>
<p>Assessment, planning and evaluation require a stronger focus on identifying and supporting children&rsquo;s significant learning and dispositions.</p>
<p>Te reo me ng&#257; tikanga M&#257;ori needs to be more integrated across the programme and environment to better reflect the commitment stated in the teaching philosophy.</p>
<p>Centre leaders, identify, and ERO's external evaluation confirms, that transition to school for children and their families is an area to develop.</p>
<p>Self review is improvement focused. Teachers see the value in undertaking review and are developing their understanding of the process. They have identified reviewing their philosophy as a priority to develop a shared vision and beliefs as a foundation for ways of working together. They have started this process.</p>
<p>Teachers acknowledge, and ERO's external evaluation confirms, that self review is at the early stages and requires further understanding and development by staff to use more effectively as a tool for improvement.</p>
<p>Sound professional leadership is provided by the PSM and business manager. Regular meetings with the centre manager assist effective communication and ensure alignment of practice with the organisation&rsquo;s expectations. An appropriate induction and mentoring programme provides good support for provisionally registered teachers. High quality, constructive support and guidance from the PSM is a key factor in enhancing outcomes for children and building teachers&rsquo; practice.</p>
<a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Oxford St Community Kindy completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Next Review</h2>
<p>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</p>
<p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p>

<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<p>Review focus</p>
<p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p>
<ul><li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
<p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p></html>
