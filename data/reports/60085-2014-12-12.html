</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Whitby Educare is a privately owned, full day early childhood service catering for 72 children up to school age. The centre operates in partnership with Educare.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy is based on the concept of environmental awareness and the centre's involvement in NZ Enviro Schools. The owners have recently developed a wilderness outdoor area and multiple sustainable gardens.</p><p>There has been a change of ownership since the previous review. Prior to 2012 the centre operated under two licences. One was for children aged up to two, and the other for those aged over two. The centre has now merged under one combined licence, although the two groups continue to be physically separated within the building.</p><p>ERO’s reporting history for the under-two children's service is very good, but the reports for overtwo service have been less positive. This is the first ERO review of the combined centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The new owners of Whitby Educare are well supported by Educare managers and have made a number of improvements, in consultation with parents, to better provide a positive learning environment for children.</p><p>Key elements of the collaboratively developed philosophy are evident in practice. The ongoing development of the environment helps the children learn sustainable practices. Relationships between people, places and natural resources are fostered in everyday routines.</p><p>The owners have improved partnerships with parents and whānau. The closer knowledge of the children enables teachers to develop a more child-focused programme.</p><p>The owners have a sound programme review process which has resulted in positive changes to the curriculum. In particular, the centre’s planning and assessment practices have been refined to better identify children’s interests, strengths and learning needs. The analysis of the learning informs planning.</p><p>The under-twos’ (Geckos) room has a gentle, calm atmosphere. Teachers sensitively interact with the children. Constant conversations and descriptive praise provide a sound foundation for development.</p><p>In the over-twos’ (Tuataras) room, children actively engage in learning and exploration. The new licence and centre popularity have led to increased numbers of children. The owners need to review the impact of this change and reconsider the organisation and value of group times. Interactions are generally positive, but some teachers do not sufficiently engage children in conversations.</p><p>Literacy, mathematics and science learning are well interwoven into the curriculum. Teachers ably introduce mathematics and science concepts into the curriculum through authentic learning experiences.</p><p>Teachers’ appraisals are robust. The next step is for teachers to have more evidence-based reflection on their practice and receive targeted support to promote their professional growth.</p><p>Appraisals have identified the need for teachers to improve their knowledge and skills in te reo me ngā tikanga Māori. Educare is planning a full review of the quality and impact of its provision for success for Māori children as Māori, and also its bicultural provision. This review is timely.</p><p>The centre’s useful set of procedures for children moving into, within and to school is evident in practice. Children and parents are well supported in all stages of their early childhood journey and into school.</p><p>The owners have developed good relationships with parents and whānau. They communicate through a range of media and successfully share children’s learning digitally.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To improve learning outcomes for children, centre managers and teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>evaluate the quality and impact of group times in the Tuatara room</li>
<li>provide professional development to increase teachers’ understanding and use of reo me ngā tikanga Māori</li>
<li>extend children’s learning and challenge their thinking and problem-solving skills through effective questioning</li>
<li>grow professional practice through well targeted support.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Whitby Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Whitby Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region</p><p>12 December 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
