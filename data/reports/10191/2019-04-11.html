</table><p>Sathya Sai Preschool - Rongomai is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Sathya Sai Preschool - Rongomai, offers free early childhood education and care for up to 40 children from 2 to 5 years old. Most of the children who attend identify as Māori or Pacific. The centre is located on the grounds of Rongomai School and is owned and operated by the Sathya Sai Values Education &amp; Services Trust (New Zealand). The management committee is accountable to the trust's national governance board.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is founded on the values of right conduct, peace, truth, love and non-violence. Teachers aim to model these values in their practice. The philosophy acknowledges the unique place of tangata whenua and the centre's role in supporting children to be proud of their heritage.</p><p>The chairperson of the management committee and the centre supervisor are long-serving members of the Sathya Sai Preschool, and are new to their roles since the 2015 ERO review. There have been many new appointments to the management committee, centre leadership and teaching team in this time. The board employs a centre manager, five qualified teaching staff, and three support staff.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are developing their social competency, and learning to take increased responsibility for their own and others' wellbeing. They enjoy playing with their peers, and their talk is encouraged and respected by adults. Teachers engage children in warm, welcoming interactions. The curriculum provides opportunities for children to discuss fairness with adults, and to learn about the centre's values. Teachers increasingly recognise and respond to opportunities that engage and extend children's individual interests.</p><p>Teachers have accessed external professional development to implement intentional teaching practices that support successful outcomes for Māori and Pacific children. They are continuing to improve the integration of Māori concepts and language throughout the curriculum. Where appropriate, they support children to lead in aspects of their cultural knowledge. Leaders and teachers are building on positive relationships with parents/whānau to develop authentic learning partnerships and value their contributions to programme planning.</p><p>Teachers have benefitted from external professional development to build their professional practice. Leaders and teachers have improved the integration of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and Sathya Sai values. They have recently introduced play-based learning and reviewed the purpose of assessment, curriculum design and evaluation. A next step should be to refine the philosophy to better reflect the centre's commitment to <em>Te Whāriki</em>.</p><p>Leaders are continuing to develop relational trust to build a collaborative organisational culture. They have established peer and team teaching practices for curriculum design and internal evaluation. An improved appraisal system has been implemented. This should support teachers to take a leading role to develop their professional practice. Leaders continue to foster teachers' understanding of internal evaluation, and establish emergent leadership to improve the collective capability of the staff.</p><p>Centre management and governance committees have a strong understanding of the vision and mission. They are strategically focused on improvement for the local community. Leaders have started to link internal evaluation to the centre's philosophy. To build on this initiative, external support to develop teachers' evaluation capability needs to continue to be a priority.</p><p>The management committee has implemented a sound policy framework with good systems and processes to support health and safety. They agree that they should now formalise induction processes, and clarify the roles and responsibilities of the management and governance committees.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The management committee agrees that the priorities to improve outcomes for children are to continue external professional development to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>refine the centre philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and use internal evaluation to improve children's learning and wellbeing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance the quality of teaching, assessment practices and curriculum design</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop emergent leadership.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Sathya Sai Preschool - Rongomai completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>11 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
