<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 Background</span></h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Child Pre-School Education Ltd governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the February 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p><ul>
<li>the quality of centre management systems and practices to ensure ongoing improvement, including monitoring and quality assurance systems, self review, impact of professional development and the development of strategic and annual plans</li>
<li>the quality of assessment, programme planning and the impact of routines on children&rsquo;s play</li>
<li>the quality of bicultural practice</li>
<li>any other issues that may arise during the course of the review.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Child Pre-School Education Ltd was established in 2008. The service caters for up to 128 children, including up to 30 children aged under two. Programmes are provided for children according to their ages and stages of development, in five separate rooms. Children benefit from the high ratio of teachers to children.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report recommended that centre managers seek external support and professional development to address concerns.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>Centre managers have made good progress in addressing the areas of concern noted in the previous ERO report. They have developed a strategic plan that is used as a working document to record their reflections and future plans for improvement.</p><p>The positive relationships between teachers and children, and with families, noted previously continue to be evident across the centre. Children play well with and alongside their peers. Most teachers engage in children&rsquo;s play and support their learning effectively.</p><p>New resources have been added to the indoor and outdoor play areas. The outdoor areas have been improved through the installation of all-weather surfaces.</p><p>Managers have begun to improve self-review practices through better documentation and seeking teacher input. Staff have benefited from involvement in professional development. The teacher appraisal system has been fully implemented and encourages teachers to reflect on their practice.</p><p>Managers continue to seek ways to strengthen bicultural aspects of the programme. They are continuing to increase teacher capability and confidence in using te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori with the children.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>Centre managers have developed templates that guide a consistent approach to programme planning across the centre. In order to make this planning more specific to individual children and to each room, teachers could better identify and document their response to children&rsquo;s emerging interests.</p><p>In order to continue to improve centre practices, managers and staff could:</p><ul>
<li>formalise the strategic plan, to show how intended improvements will be achieved over several years</li>
<li>use the strategic plan to develop a more detailed annual plan that highlights the priorities for each year and allows managers to systematically monitor progress towards the identified goals</li>
<li>take account of external expertise and research information in decision making</li>
<li>review the centre&rsquo;s philosophy, and develop a teaching philosophy that is specific for each room.</li>
</ul><p>Managers would improve teacher appraisal considerably by including input from ongoing teaching observations, clear job descriptions, and centre&rsquo;s goals for improvement. Clearer consideration of the Registered Teacher Criteria would be helpful.</p><p>The quality of programme delivery is variable across the centre. It would be useful for managers to identify and document a shared understanding of good practice. Teachers who are displaying effective early childhood practice practices could serve as models for other staff. Teachers in the room for older children could reflect on ways to better engage these children.</p><p>Managers and staff could use the Ministry of Education&rsquo;s resource <em>T&#257;taiako</em> as a guide to building their teachers&rsquo; cultural competencies as teachers of M&#257;ori learners. This would also improve decision making, strategic planning and strengthen their teacher appraisal.</p><a id="3-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>31 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Service</h2><table>
