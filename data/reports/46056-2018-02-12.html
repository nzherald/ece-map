</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>MoreForKids Ltd provides all day education and care for up to 38 children, including 12 aged up to two years. Most children attending the centre are Māori. The service is located in Gisborne city.</p><p>The centre is owned by Pink Robin Limited. A manager is responsible for the day-to-day operation, and a supervisor leads the teaching staff.</p><p>Management's vision is for every child to develop a love of learning and know about their identity, language and culture. Leaders value te reo Māori me te ao Māori as integral parts of the curriculum.</p><p>In the past eighteen months, extensive property development has been undertaken to upgrade the indoor and outdoor learning environments. Provision for evacuation has been improved. More resources have been purchased for play.</p><p>Staffing has now stabilised after many changes in 2016. Leaders and teachers have participated in a range of external professional learning opportunities.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers have a strong focus on supporting learners to follow their interests. Respectful interactions are evident. Children have fun and interact well with each other.</p><p>Older children make good use of materials and equipment to problem solve, create and explore. Physical activity is well promoted in the outdoor, well-shaded environment.</p><p>Teachers interact responsively with children aged up to two years. They give children space and time to lead their learning. The under-two area is well set up for children to explore, play freely and make choices. There are often opportunities for interactions with older children and siblings.</p><p>All teachers regularly plan for individual children's learning using observations and whānau aspirations. Learning stories (horopaki) record children's learning linked to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and identify possible next steps. Leaders are supporting teachers to develop assessment to better outline children's progress and increase depth and complexity of their learning. Building all teachers capabilities and confidence in evaluating outcomes for children when planning and assessing is a next step. </p><p>Developing and maintaining positive learning partnerships with parents and whānau is a high priority at this service. Whānau input is sought and valued.</p><p>Māori children are well engaged in learning and benefit from a vision, values and range of strategies that affirm their language, culture and identities. Te reo Māori and te ao Māori are actively promoted and are integral to the curriculum. Tuakana teina relationships are encouraged and evident, with older children looking after those who are younger.</p><p>Following a review of the transition-to-school process, new practices have been successfully integrated into the regular daily programme. These recognise and build on four-year-old children's interests. Leaders and teachers continue to integrate literacy and numeracy learning into the curriculum.</p><p>Children with additional learning needs receive extra support from external agencies. Specialists work alongside whānau and teachers to scaffold each child's learning.</p><p>The manager and supervisor show a strong commitment to the service philosophy. Leaders focus on developing consistent, high quality teaching and model this themselves. High expectations are communicated. An improved appraisal process provides clear expectations and processes to support ongoing improvement of teacher practice. A next step is to further refine induction and mentoring for provisionally registered teachers.</p><p>The manager has developed a comprehensive policy framework to guide centre operation. A cycle for review of these policies is established and documented.</p><p>Leaders are focused on ongoing improvement to outcomes for children. Centre leaders and staff are beginning to use a planned and systematic approach to review the effectiveness of centre programmes and practices. As a result, decisions have been made that have led to improved outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>The manager, supervisor and teachers should continue to:</p><ul>
<li>develop a shared understanding of high quality assessment and evaluation processes that supports ongoing improvement to outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of MoreForKids Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.  In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of MoreForKids Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard<br> Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</p><p>12 February 2018 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning. </p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 0px;">

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau. </p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to </em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em>. </em></a><em></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
