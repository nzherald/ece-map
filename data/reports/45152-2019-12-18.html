</table><p><span>BestStart Petone <span>is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</span></span></p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>BestStart Petone provides all-day education and care for up to 97 children, including 25 children aged under two years. Of the roll of 113 children, 25 are Māori and seven are of Pacific heritage. BestStart Petone is owned by BestStart Educare Ltd, a national organisation that owns early childhood services across New Zealand.</p><p>The centre's vision is 'Where the wild things come to play'. This vision is underpinned by the values of 'ako, taha tinana, whanaungatanga, kotahitanga and manaakitanga'.</p><p>Since the September 2016 ERO review a new centre manager has been appointed, a new leadership has been recently established and there have been changes in the teaching team. Most teachers are fully qualified. The day-to-day operations are the responsibility of centre manager, who supports the teaching team. There are three learning areas: the 'Jungle' space caters for preschool children and 'Woodlands' and 'Forest' spaces enable babies and toddlers to interact and play together.</p><p>ERO's September 2016 report identified areas requiring further development. These included: strengthening intentional teaching strategies; the quality of assessment, planning and evaluation; the bicultural curriculum; teachers' knowledge of promoting educational success for Māori and Pacific children; and capability in internal evaluation and appraisal.</p><p>Good progress has been made in strengthening intentional strategies, the quality of assessment, planning and evaluation and appraisal. Progress is ongoing in developing a bicultural approach, promoting success for Māori and Pacific children and internal evaluation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children play freely in thoughtfully designed, well-resourced indoor and outdoor environments. Teachers work alongside children using a range of intentional teaching strategies to support and add complexity to their learning. Children have opportunities to create, experiment and have fun through planned hands-on experiences. Positive, respectful interactions are highly evident.</p><p>Responsive caregiving supports infants' and toddlers' need for strong and secure attachments. A calm, slow-paced environment enables less mobile and younger children to have space and time to lead their learning.</p><p>Local history and stories of Pakiwaitara and the Wellington Harbour are acknowledged in the curriculum which promotes a play and nature-based, child-led programme. Te ao Māori concepts are evident in learning programmes. Visual and creative art incorporates the use of natural and found materials. Weekly visits to a local bush area encourage children to be close observers of nature, promote respect for the living environment and be kaitiaki, guardians of the land.</p><p>The philosophy has recently been reviewed by leaders and the teaching team. An agreed focus now is to draw on parent and whānau aspirations to determine what learning and education success is important to them.</p><p>Planning and assessment for learning processes are deliberately integrated into the learning programme. A useful planning framework guides teacher practice. Group and individual plans are based on children’s emerging interests. The teaching team works collaboratively with parents and whānau to develop specific learning goals for their child. Assessment of learning moments provide a rich record of children’s engagement, participation and social interactions. Teachers use <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, to develop specific learning outcomes for each child. They identify intentional teaching strategies to support the achievement of these outcomes. This helps extend and enrich the programme.</p><p>Leaders and teachers acknowledge that the bicultural programme is an area to build understanding and practice. Children would benefit from increased opportunities to hear and use te reo Māori and learn about their dual heritage as bicultural citizens of Aotearoa. This developing learning should be clearly evident in children’s and teachers' conversations, planning and portfolios.</p><p>Review contributes to centre improvement. Teachers inquire into aspects of their practice. Understanding of internal evaluation and building teachers capacity and capability to evaluate is developing. To enhance practice, an important next step is to develop a stronger focus on measuring how well children have met their learning outcomes through this process.</p><p>Relationships with parents and whānau are valued. The extensive use of an online communication portal informs parents and enables them to provide feedback and learn through centre-developed parenting resources.</p><p>An effective distributed leadership model is promoted. Teachers are confident to take on additional responsibilities and lead aspects of the curriculum according to their strengths and interests. Teachers are engaged and enthusiastic practitioners.</p><p>The professional service management team provides feedback, support and guidance for leadership and the teaching team. BestStart provides a range of professional learning and development opportunities for staff.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for leaders and teachers are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthen the bicultural curriculum and strategies that respond to the cultural context of Māori and Pacific children and reflect this in planning and assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to build internal evaluation capacity and capability.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of BestStart Petone completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Te Tai Tini</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>18 December 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
