<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">ABC Te Aroha provides good quality education and care for up to 32 children from two to five years of age, in an attractively presented and well-resourced learning environment. Many children move to this centre from the ABC Te Aroha Teina centre for younger children.</p><p align="left">This is the first ERO report since Kidicorp Ltd. purchased the centre in November 2011. Kidicorp management provides clear strategic direction, targeted professional development and effective guidance and support for the acting centre manager and teaching team. Meaningful self review informs ongoing improvement, and the acting centre director provides strong professional leadership.</p><p align="left">Teachers keep families well informed about their children&rsquo;s learning. They warmly welcome parent and wh&#257;nau contributions to programme planning, the learning environment, portfolios and review processes.</p><p align="left">Adult interactions with children are consistently respectful and caring. Teachers skilfully foster the development of language and social skills. They provide good opportunities for children to explore literacy, mathematical and scientific concepts, and to learn about aspects of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori.</p><p align="left">Teachers effectively support children through child-initiated play to become capable and competent learners. Children play well with and alongside others, and make creative use of the environment to develop their play. A next step for teachers is to increase opportunities for children to plan how to extend their ideas and interests.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of ABC Te Aroha was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at ABC Te Aroha.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Since ERO&rsquo;s 2009 Supplementary Review Report on ABC Te Aroha, centre management and the members of the teaching team have changed.</p><p align="left">At the end of 2011, Kidicorp Ltd became the centre&rsquo;s new owner and in March 2012 the centre was relicensed under the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008. When the centre director resigned, an acting centre manager took over day-to-day management. After a period of high staff turnover, the teaching team now includes four full-time registered early childhood teachers.</p><p align="left">Kidicorp Ltd provides ongoing mentoring, professional development and support for centre personnel. Teachers have recently commenced whole centre external professional development to further enhance children&rsquo;s social skills.</p><p align="left">Teachers aim to provide a child-centred programme and environment so that children can extend their interests and dispositions for learning. They value working in partnership with parents, respecting families&rsquo; beliefs and cultures, the Treaty of Waitangi and providing bicultural experiences and practices.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left"><b>Interactions:</b> Teachers&rsquo; interactions with children are calm, respectful and caring. They skilfully foster the development of children&rsquo;s social and language skills, and empower children to resolve conflict independently. Teachers encourage children to plan their own play and identify the resources they need. They place a strong emphasis on supporting children&rsquo;s learning through conversations.</p><p align="left"><b>Programme:</b> Teachers are committed to implementing a programme in which children initiate and develop their own learning. Since 2009, they have significantly increased opportunities for children to make decisions about their learning and to engage in sustained periods of uninterrupted play. Children have good opportunities to explore literacy, mathematical and scientific concepts and the creative arts. Teachers have recently strengthened bicultural practices and the use of te reo M&#257;ori.</p><p align="left">Teachers keep families well informed about their children&rsquo;s learning. They have significantly improved the use of learning stories to document the development of children&rsquo;s interests and dispositions for learning over time. The teaching team is also focusing on increasing family contributions to the programme, learning environment and planning and assessment practices.</p><p align="left"><b>Environment:</b> Teachers provide an interesting and inviting learning environment for children. It is very clean and well-maintained. Children have independent access to a wide range of high-quality, aesthetically presented resources and equipment. There is a free flow of play between the indoor and outdoor learning areas. Aspects of M&#257;ori language and culture are well reflected in centre displays.</p><p align="left"><b>Outcomes for children:</b> The programme philosophy and teaching practices provide good support for children to become capable and competent learners. Children play well with and alongside others, and are confident communicators. They rearrange the learning environment and make creative use of equipment to support their play.</p><p align="left"><b>Leadership and self review:</b> Kidicorp Ltd provides clear strategic direction, targeted professional development, and high-quality mentoring and guidance for the acting centre manager and staff. A culture of meaningful self review shapes centre practice and strategic direction. Teachers appreciate the strong professional leadership that the acting centre manager provides and her shared leadership style. She has established a positive and collegial team culture. Kidicorp Ltd Is in the process of implementing a more robust system of staff appraisal that promotes ongoing self reflection and clear feedback against specific criteria. This has the potential to further strengthen teaching practice.</p><h3>Agreed priorities for development and review</h3><p align="left">ERO and centre management agree on the following teaching priorities:</p><ul>
<li>increasing opportunities for children to participate in planning to extend their ideas and interests, and</li>
<li>more promptly implementing ideas to support extension of children&rsquo;s emerging interests.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the service provider contact person and acting centre manager of ABC Te Aroha completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Future Action</h2><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table style="width: 568px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup>

Many children move to this centre from the ABC Te Aroha Teina centre for younger children.</p><p align="left">This is the first ERO report since Kidicorp Ltd. purchased the centre in November 2011. Kidicorp management provides clear strategic direction, targeted professional development and effective guidance and support for the acting centre manager and teaching team. Meaningful self review informs ongoing improvement, and the acting centre director provides strong professional leadership.</p><p align="left">Teachers keep families well informed about their children&rsquo;s learning. They warmly welcome parent and wh&#257;nau contributions to programme planning, the learning environment, portfolios and review processes.</p><p align="left">Adult interactions with children are consistently respectful and caring. Teachers skilfully foster the development of language and social skills. They provide good opportunities for children to explore literacy, mathematical and scientific concepts, and to learn about aspects of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori.</p><p align="left">Teachers effectively support children through child-initiated play to become capable and competent learners. Children play well with and alongside others, and make creative use of the environment to develop their play. A next step for teachers is to increase opportunities for children to plan how to extend their ideas and interests.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p></html>
