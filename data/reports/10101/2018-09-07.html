</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Akoteu Faka-Kalisitiane Ko Namoa is a Tongan language early childhood centre in Mangere Bridge, Auckland. The akoteu philosophy promotes Tongan language and culture alongside Christianity and <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. The centre is licensed for up to 36 children, including a maximum of four up to two years of age.</p><p>The centre is governed by the Tokaikolo Education Trust Board (TETB) and managed by the Akoteu Faka-Kalisitiane Ko Namoa management committee. Since the 2017 ERO review, a new centre manager has been appointed. A supervisor has responsibility for professional leadership in the service and reports to the management committee.</p><p>Since ERO's 2017 review, the board and management committee have made good progress in addressing the areas of concern identified by ERO. Curriculum professional support is reflected well in improved teaching and learning. Health and safety practices have been established.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enter the akoteu confidently, display a strong sense of belonging, and choose and become highly engaged in activities. They are relaxed and secure in the akoteu and enjoy caring relationships with other children and teachers. Children also display good social skills and respect for each other as they interact, explore and engage in periods of sustained play.</p><p>Children benefit from supportive and nurturing caregiving. Teachers recognise the communication styles of individual children and respond appropriately to their needs. They encourage children's independence and support them to make choices. Teachers provide good quality care for infants and toddlers, and at times these younger children play alongside older children.</p><p>Tongan language and culture are strongly evident in the learning environment and in teaching practices. Teachers' cultural backgrounds reflect those of the children attending. Teachers value and support children's home languages. Centre leaders and teachers have a good level of commitment to increasing the extent to which te ao Māori is visible in the programme.</p><p>The curriculum offers children opportunities for learning and exploration through play. The results of children's learning are evident in the environment. Mat time routines gives children opportunities for movement and song and to speak to the group. Te reo Māori, Tongan, waiata, dance and karakia are woven through mat time, reflecting the philosophy and culture of the centre.</p><p>Children have good access to outdoor areas. A large sandpit, bikes and a climbing frame are enjoyed by children in the outside area. Teachers could now increase resourcing of the outdoor area to further support the development of children's complex play and learning.</p><p>Teachers identify children's interests and set learning objectives for them based on their observations. Observation and recording of children's developing interests provide good information for teachers' planning, assessment and development of next steps for learning.</p><p>A transition programme is in place to support children starting school. A review of this programme could help strengthen relationships with local schools. Stronger pathways between the centre and school would benefit children starting school.</p><p>Programme planning is linked to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers respond to children's individual interests in their planning. Children's portfolios contain a mix of individual and group learning stories and are beginning to show the development of individual children's learning.</p><p>A teacher appraisal process, linked to the Education Council requirements, has been established. The new centre leader, supported by the board, is working to develop a culture of quality teaching practice. Teachers should now strengthen internal evaluation. This could help to ensure evaluative processes provide teachers with further insight into their practice, and contribute to positive outcomes for children's learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to improve practice and promote positive outcomes for children, the board and leaders need to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>build internal evaluation across all centre operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure ongoing professional learning in leadership and effective teaching is available for all leaders and teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>prioritise governance training for the board</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>prioritise funding in the akoteu's budget to develop resources that promote choice and challenge in children's learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>prioritise professional learning funding in the akoteu's budget to enable teachers to fulfil Education Council requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Akoteu Faka-Kalisitiane Ko Namoa completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Akoteu Faka-Kalisitiane Ko Namoa will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>7 September 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
