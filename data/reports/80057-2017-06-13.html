</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>St Clair Corner Early Learning Centres are privately owned and are on two sites. The infants and toddlers are on one site and the older children on the other. Children come from a range of cultural backgrounds. This Infant and Toddler centre is licensed for 25 children, including up to 25 children under 2. There is one outdoor area for the young children.</p><p>Leadership of the centres include the owner, who is the director; the centre manager/supervisor, and the assistant supervisor. The director and the manager have shared responsibility for both sites.</p><p>Progress has been made in addressing the key next steps identified in the 2014 ERO report. Since the last review the owner, leaders and teachers have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>introduced an effective online planning, assessment and evaluation tool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embedded useful processes for evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthened bicultural practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sought and responded to parent and whānau views.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The shared mission and vision statements have recently been reviewed and promote a holistic play-based approach to learning with literacy and numeracy naturally integrated. Infants and toddlers have space and time to learn through free play. They experience warm nurturing interactions with adults. Teachers thoughtfully fit the care routines around the children's needs. They work closely with adults to ensure children's wellbeing and learning reflects routines from the home environment.</p><p>Teachers are committed to building strong and trusting relationships with children and their whānau. Teachers are strengthening their partnerships with parents. They are actively seeking further ways to give whānau a greater say in key aspects of the centre. These practices support Māori children and their whānau to feel valued and have a sense of belonging.</p><p>A strength of the service is the careful thought given to transitions into, within and out of the service. Teachers work collaboratively across both services and share knowledge and ideas to increase the quality of the teaching and learning programmes.</p><p>Teachers deliberately share and build their own capabilities in te reo Māori and culturally responsive practices. The leaders and teachers value and provide opportunities for families and children to share their culture language and identity. Children with diverse learning needs are well catered for.</p><p>The director and leaders have developed a well-used strategic plan to guide centre developments. This could be strengthened to reflect more explicitly professional development, actions and resources needed to achieve these objectives.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner and leaders have identified, and ERO agrees that the next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>regularly review and evaluate the effectiveness of progress towards the goals in the strategic plan</li>
<li>continue to develop the new appraisal system to include expectations for observations and explicit links to Tātaiako.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of St Clair Corner Infants and Toddlers Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of St Clair Corner Infants and Toddlers Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Te Waipounamu)</p><p>13 June 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
