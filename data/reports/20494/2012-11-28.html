<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Evaluation of the Service</h2>
<p><strong>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</strong></p>
<p>Learning Curves Childcare Centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Learning Curves Childcare Centre is located in Blockhouse Bay and caters for children from birth to five years of age. Most children at the centre are over two years of age. The centre has strong partnerships with family and wh&#257;nau, and a history of positive ERO reports. Recommendations from previous reports have formed a basis for centre developments.</p>
<p>Centre self-review systems have continued to improve and have been used by staff to evaluate programmes, resources and teaching practice in an ongoing manner. Teachers are dedicated to strengthening the bicultural aspects of programmes and teaching practice. They have also explored ways to build links with local schools in order to support children&rsquo;s transition from the centre to these schools.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Consistent with the centre&rsquo;s philosophy of developing lifelong learners, children are given many opportunities to explore and develop understandings about the environment and the wider world. Children also have opportunities to participate in a variety of cultural events.</p>
<p>Centre managers and staff are committed to ongoing improvement. Well considered organisational structures empower all staff to be active participants in self-review processes. These collaborative approaches contribute to strong centre direction and self review that has a positive impact on outcomes for children. Centre managers plan to build on current effective self-review processes by revisiting the impact of improvement initiatives and ensuring that parent feedback informs the centre&rsquo;s strategic planning.</p>
<p>Children play cooperatively, supporting each other in their learning. Warm, respectful relationships are evident and teachers are responsive to children&rsquo;s emerging interests. Teachers are strong advocates for children and treat them as capable learners.</p>
<p>Children are actively involved in decision making about their learning. They are well supported to develop social skills and to enhance their learning. As a result, children settle well to their play and are able to interact both independently and collaboratively. There are some good examples of teachers extending children&rsquo;s complex play. These good models of sustained, complex and extended play could provide a basis for developing greater consistency in the quality of teaching and learning practice.</p>
<p>A range of resources is available to support children&rsquo;s play. Teachers provide physical challenges for children by varying outdoor equipment. Discrete areas of play allow children to be extended in their use of resources, including those provided in the carpentry and music areas.</p>
<p>The licensee is an experienced, strong professional leader who provides teachers with opportunities for leadership. She supports them with considered professional development, and helps to develop a culture of reflective practice within the centre. Centre leaders set high expectations and model effective practice.</p>
<p>Well considered planning responds to children&rsquo;s interests. Planning and assessment is closely aligned to <em>Te Wh&#257;riki,</em> the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, and is informed by current early childhood education theories.</p>
<p>To improve programmes, the licensee has identified the need to:</p>
<ul><li>further develop children&rsquo;s portfolios to include a greater focus on learning to provide parents with better information about how well their children are progressing</li>
<li>incorporate more opportunities for early literacy and mathematics within the context of play.</li>
</ul><p>Areas that have been identified for further review and development include:</p>
<ul><li>communicating with parents in various ways about early childhood education principles and practice</li>
<li>provoking and extending children&rsquo;s learning through play</li>
<li>exploring ways to promote greater success for M&#257;ori children as M&#257;ori.</li>
</ul><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Legal Requirements</h2>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Learning Curves Childcare Centre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Next Review</h2>
<h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p>

<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>Review focus</h3>
<p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p>
<ul><li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Individual ERO school and early childhood service reports are public information and may be copied or sent electronically. However, the Education Review Office can guarantee only the authenticity of original documents which have been obtained in hard copy directly from either the local ERO office or ERO National Office in Wellington.</p></html>
