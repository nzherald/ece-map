</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Te Kuiti is licensed to provide education and care for 40 children aged 2 years and over. There are currently 37 children enrolled in the Kindergarten, 20 of whom are Māori. Most whakapapa to Ngāti Maniapoto.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed, and well supported by the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust. The trust’s strategic direction sets out the service’s vision, expected educational outcomes and values. It also defines the strategies for delivering the principles and strands of the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki</em>, and for respecting Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The trust’s professional leaders monitor the kindergarten’s compliance with policies and procedures to ensure it meets regulation requirements and management expectations. Kindergarten teachers have generous opportunities for professional development to grow their teaching and leadership skills.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review there have been some changes in staff. Good progress has been made in addressing areas for review and development identified in the 2012 ERO report in the areas of assessment, planning, evaluation and bicultural approaches to teaching and learning. Staff have been involved in self-review of playground redevelopment, determining the aspirations of whānau and promotion of greater critical inquiry and self-reflection.</p><p>The kindergarten’s philosophy emphasises promotion of independence and supporting children to become competent and confident learners. This philosophy is strongly reflected in the kindergarten’s learning programme and environment, which is characterised by caring respectful relationships and a rich range of learning opportunities.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergarten reviews in the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children were observed to be confident, active and engaged in their learning and play. They are able to make choices about their learning and are able to sustain involvement in a wide range of learning experiences.</p><p>The learning environment both inside and outside is safe, very well resourced and attractively presented to support children’s learning. Particular features of the environment include</p><ul>
<li>the integration of literacy and mathematics</li>
<li>opportunities for challenge in the outside area both in a physical sense and in terms of scope for exploration and experimentation</li>
<li>a focus on the natural world</li>
<li>promotion of ‘hands on’ creative activities.</li>
</ul><p>Aspects of tikanga Māori are strongly reflected in the environment and in the learning programme. Staff use te reo Māori in their interactions with children. Māori parents indicated that they felt at home in the kindergarten. There is an inclusive atmosphere and children from a variety of backgrounds and with diverse needs are acknowledged and affirmed.</p><p>The environment and programme strongly support and promote engagement and sharing of information about children’s learning with parents and whānau. This includes newsletters, children’s profiles, online information about children’s learning and the opportunity for daily conversations between parents and teachers. Children are well supported in their transition to school.</p><p>Teachers are experienced and knowledgeable. They are caring and affirming of children, and are responsive to their interests and preferences. Teachers are finding ways to support children to lead and manage their own learning. There has been ongoing development of the assessment, planning and evaluation of children’s learning. Portfolios provide well-presented and accessible records of children’s learning and development. Recorded observations are focused on individual children.</p><p>Teachers participate in ongoing professional development and are being supported to be increasingly reflective about their practice. They are currently working with professional leaders to strengthen self review. This includes extending the range of strategies that enable them to respond appropriately to children in order to enhance their social competence. The kindergarten, with the support of the professional leader, is in the process of reviewing appraisal procedures to ensure that teachers are able to monitor and review their practice over time.</p><p>The head teacher is highly experienced and has a strong focus on improving outcomes for children. She continues to model warm and welcoming interactions with parents and whānau and provides strong links with the local community.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten management agree that a key next step for the service is that of further developing the quality of self review as a means of building team and teacher capability, particularly in the areas of:</p><ul>
<li>responding to children’s culture and identity</li>
<li>exploring ways to deepen learning conversations to extend children’s learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Te Kuiti completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Te Kuiti will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>22 December 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
