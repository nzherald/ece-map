<a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2>
<p>North New Brighton Playcentre is one of 50 playcentres administered by the Canterbury Playcentre Association. The playcentre operates within the constitution of the association. The treasurer of the association is also the licensee of all Canterbury playcentres.</p>
<p>The association offers parents opportunities to train in playcentre early childhood education without costs to the parent. The association expects all parents to take responsibility and share leadership of the day-to-day operation of the playcentre.</p>
<p>The 2007 ERO review identified that parents needed to improve the way they supported children’s learning, used te reo Māori in the session and presented the outside learning environment. Parents also needed to improve assessment, planning and self review. Most of these areas for improvement still exist and are identified as areas for further improvement in this report.</p>
<p>The association needs to provide further support and leadership to the committee in assessment, self review and the induction of new parents.</p>
<p>Positive features of the playcentre programme include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the child-led and self-choice programme where children can make their own decisions about play;</li>
<li>a good range of accessible activities and resources;</li>
<li>the welcoming environment provided to new parents; and</li>
<li>the way that the coordinator and association representative model effective interactions with children.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next steps for the association and parents to address are:</p>
<ul>
<li>making parents more aware of the association’s expectations and their responsibilities as members of a parent cooperative;</li>
<li>to focus on extending individual children’s learning through centre documentation, profiles, planning and interactions; and</li>
<li>improving self-review practices so that parents are able to develop an awareness of the value of using self review to improve the playcentre practices and the programme.</li>
</ul>
<p>The coordinator and association need to strengthen systems for health and safety in a significant number of areas. The areas of concern are listed in section five of this report.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO intends to return to the centre within a year to evaluate the progress made in response to the recommendations in this report.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of North New Brighton Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atNorth New Brighton Playcentre.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p>ERO’s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The philosophy is based on the idea that children learn best when they are free to explore their environment and follow their own interests supported by adults. Adults are encouraged to learn alongside their children and attend playcentre education courses.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>Children have good opportunities to make choices within the daily programme. Children explore the environment following their own interests. They can self select from resources or ask adults for any resources that they cannot get independently. Most parents make good use of the playcentre session to work alongside their own child. Children are able to make their own choices about the pace of their day by choosing when to participate in routines such as kai time.</p>
<p>Children experience a good range of activities. Resources support children’s creativity, musical play, construction and physical development. Some adults incorporate te reo Māori when they are playing alongside children. The parent group organises trips to areas in the local community to support children’s interests. Some activities are linked to children’s interests through a theme-based approach to planning.</p>
<p>The coordinator and centre support person model effective interactions with children. Older children initiated contact with these adults and invited them into their play. When these adults interacted with children they:</p>
<ul>
<li>used a variety of questions and responses to encourage children to share their ideas, and solve problems;</li>
<li>made links to children’s home experiences;</li>
<li>added additional resources to meet children’s interests and provide further challenge; and</li>
<li>encouraged children to share and take turns.</li>
</ul>
<p>Parents use the programme for support and socialising. They said that they felt welcome at the playcentre and that positive relationships exist between parents. Playcentre provides good opportunities for their children to play with and alongside others.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p>New parents have yet to be made aware of their responsibilities as part of a parent cooperative. Children’s health and safety around kai practices was not always well monitored. Not all parents understand the centre routines, policies or practices. [Recommendation 5.1]</p>
<p>There is limited focus on children’s learning in centre documentation and interactions. Parents are unclear about how to recognise and extend individual children’s interests. Interactions are yet to regularly focus on extending children’s language and ideas. Assessment records vary widely in quality, and regularity. This makes it difficult to plan the programme to respond appropriately to children’s interests and capabilities. Parents have sent out a questionnaire to gain centre parents’ feedback on the range of ways they extend children’s learning. [Recommendation 5.2 and Action 4.6]</p>
<p>Parents have yet to develop an understanding of, or process for, centre review. Little documentation supports self review. Parents are in a cluster support group to develop self-review practices but it is unclear if parents, other than the coordinator, will attend. [Recommendation 5.3 and Action 4.7]</p>
<a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long-term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Literacy Teaching and Learning</h3>
<p>When children understand, enjoy, engage with, and use language and symbols they are better able to express their individual identity and become active participants in a literate society. As part of this review, ERO looked at literacy practices, particularly the opportunities provided for children to develop strong literacy learning foundations.</p>
<p>In this service children’s literacy learning opportunities included:</p>
<ul>
<li>easy access to pens, paper and other materials for early attempts at writing and making marks;</li>
<li>a range of books to support reading and storytelling;</li>
<li>a range of activities that help to develop children’s fine motor skills in preparation for writing;</li>
<li>games that incorporate an interpretation of words, images and symbols;</li>
<li>exposure to te reo Māori both orally and in written forms; and</li>
<li>some routines that help children to recognise their names.</li>
</ul>
<a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of North New Brighton Playcentre completed an ERO CentreManagementAssurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legislative obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the review, ERO checked the following items because they have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the course of the review, ERO identified several areas of non-compliance.</p>
<p>Some parents and some children did not follow safe or hygienic practices around food routines. The sand under the rear fence is eroded and needs attention. There is limited provision of safe places for infants and babies to crawl and play. Parents are not signing against the ratios for excursions. The paperwork for excursions is not adequately documented. Earthquake hazards exist in the office. Soft fall and maintenance is required for the swings.</p>
<p>In order to address these, the parents and association must ensure that:</p>
<ol>
<li>so far as is reasonably practicable, hazards to the safety of children are corrected, repaired, removed or made inaccessible to the children; [24(4) Education (Early Childhood Centres) Regulations 1998]</li>
<li> where children under two attend the centre, safe spaces for crawling, walking and floor play are provided; [17(7) Education (Early Childhood Centres) Regulations 1998]</li>
<li> no child is unattended while eating; [26(2c) Education (Early Childhood Centres) Regulations 1998]</li>

<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-north-new-brighton-playcentre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of North New Brighton Playcentre</h2>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office’s latest report on North New Brighton Playcentre.</p>
<p>North New Brighton Playcentre is one of 50 playcentres administered by the Canterbury Playcentre Association. The playcentre operates within the constitution of the association. The treasurer of the association is also the licensee of all Canterbury playcentres.</p>
<p>The association offers parents opportunities to train in playcentre early childhood education without costs to the parent. The association expects all parents to take responsibility and share leadership of the day-to-day operation of the playcentre.</p>
<p>The 2007 ERO review identified that parents needed to improve the way they supported children’s learning, used te reo Māori in the session and presented the outside learning environment. Parents also needed to improve assessment, planning and self review. Most of these areas for improvement still exist and are identified as areas for further improvement in this report.</p>
<p>The association needs to provide further support and leadership to the committee in assessment, self review and the induction of new parents.</p>
<p>Positive features of the playcentre programme include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the child-led and self-choice programme where children can make their own decisions about play;</li>
<li>a good range of accessible activities and resources;</li>
<li>the welcoming environment provided to new parents; and</li>
<li>the way that the coordinator and association representative model effective interactions with children.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next steps for the association and parents to address are:</p>
<ul>
<li>making parents more aware of the association’s expectations and their responsibilities as members of a parent cooperative;</li>
<li>to focus on extending individual children’s learning through centre documentation, profiles, planning and interactions; and</li>
<li>improving self-review practices so that parents are able to develop an awareness of the value of using self review to improve the playcentre practices and the programme.</li>
</ul>
<p>The coordinator and association need to strengthen systems for health and safety in a significant number of areas. The areas of concern are listed in section five of this report.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO intends to return to the centre within a year to evaluate the progress made in response to the recommendations in this report.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>
