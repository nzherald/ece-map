</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Fairfield Early Education Centre is located in the grounds of Fairfield College and provides full day education and care for children from birth to school age. The centre is licensed for 25 children, including eight under two years of age. At the time of this ERO review, 27 children were enrolled, of whom 13 identify as Māori. Children in the centre are representative of a culturally diverse community.</p><p>The centre philosophy emphasises the importance of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, diversity and partnerships with parents. In addition, the <em>Enviroschools</em>, <em>Under 5 Energise</em> and <em>Healthy Heart</em> programmes influence teachers’ practice and children's learning. Since ERO’s previous review in June 2010 a new centre manager has been appointed and there have been changes to the teaching team.</p><p>The centre operates under the umbrella of Early Education Waikato (EEW), which is a charitable trust, and does not operate for profit. EEW shares the same management structure as the Waikato Kindergarten Association. The strategic direction of EEW is guided by the overarching statement, ‘Every child reaching their full potential’. EEW has a commitment to providing high quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. All centres provide an <em>Enviroschools</em> focus as a key curriculum feature to encourage children to better understand caring for the environment.</p><p>Educational Service Managers (ESM) monitor and report to EEW on the centre’s quality of education. A kaumātua from Tainui provides advice, guidance and support about Māori language, culture and identity. The centre’s administrative responsibilities are well supported by EEW resource personnel.</p><p>The centre benefits from the EEW clear guidelines and expectations for practice and the availability of good self-review processes for monitoring and evaluating the quality of education and care it provides for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre manager implements a collaborative leadership style with her team. This collaboration encourages all teachers to contribute their individual strengths and skills to the programme. The manager is an experienced early childhood teacher who effectively supports the development of new teachers through coaching and modelling good teaching practice. EEW’s vision of ‘each child reaching their potential’ is very evident in principles of equity and social justice demonstrated by the centre manager and teaching team.</p><p>Key features of the centre curriculum include:</p><ul>
<li>genuine partnerships with parents and whānau that involve respectful and reciprocal relationships, and sharing of useful information about children’s interests, learning and wellbeing</li>
<li>a strong sense of belonging for children and families in an inclusive environment where each person’s language and cultural heritage is valued and celebrated</li>
<li>involvement in the <em>Enviroschools</em> and health initiatives that promote children’s wellbeing, knowledge of and care for themselves and their environment</li>
<li>opportunities for children to develop friendships, explore their world and become confident communicators and decision makers.</li>
</ul><p>Since ERO’s last review, the centre manager has led development in enhancing teachers’ understanding and implementation of systems and practices for recording assessment of and planning for children's learning.</p><p>Children enjoy and benefit from responsive and caring interactions with their teachers. Child-initiated play is enriched through teachers’ engagement alongside children, attuned questioning and listening to children’s ideas. Teachers promote children’s independence, through fostering self management, responsibility and effective social skills and confidence.</p><p>Tuakana/teina relationships and interactions, where older children role model and help younger peers and siblings, are highly evident in this small whānau-like setting. Children respond positively to the many opportunities to learn together and develop their interests in aspects of literacy, mathematics and natural science.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>With support from the ESM, the centre manager and teachers need to continue to review and modify assessment, planning and evaluation processes and practices to ensure a manageable and sustainable system.</p><p>Self review would be strengthened through including a more evaluative focus on teachers' practice.</p><p>There would be benefit from management support to enhance the teaching team's work and review about routines and practices associated with mix-aged centres.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Fairfield Early Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Fairfield Early Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>Northern</p><p>12 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"> ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
