<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Background</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p><p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p><h3>Terms of Reference</h3><p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the Kids to Five Puketaha governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the August 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate the service&rsquo;s internal self-review practices, and evaluate its effectiveness to monitor and improve the quality of education and care including:</p><ul>
<li>the centre&rsquo;s philosophy</li>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation processes</li>
<li>teaching interactions</li>
<li>monitoring of adult to child ratios in the nursery during staff breaks.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Evaluation Findings</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids to Five Puketaha is an early childhood education and care centre located in a rural setting on the north western boundary of Hamilton City. It caters for children from 3 months to school age in an all day programme. The centre is licensed for 68 children including 15 under the age of two. At the time of this review the centre had a roll of 85 including 6 M&#257;ori children. The centre operates three age based rooms. Features of this purpose built facility are its extensive outdoor play spaces and rural outlook.</p><p>Kidicorp (NZ) Ltd is a large umbrella organisation that operates over 200 centres throughout New Zealand. It bought this centre in December 2011, but did not take over full management of the service until November 2012.</p><p>Since the previous review in August 2012 leadership has now stabilised and there has been minimal staff turnover. The previous review identified a need to strengthen key aspects of centre practices.</p><h3>Areas of progress</h3><p>The centre has made good progress in addressing the terms of reference stated in this report.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers have developed useful, strategic approaches to self review, particularly for the review of centre wide themes such as biculturalism, and the engagement of parents and wh&#257;nau in the centre programme. These approaches are focussed on raising the quality of teaching practice and learning outcomes for children.</p><p>They have also put in place additional effective self review practices that have a lesser focus. These include:</p><ul>
<li>the implementation of the Kidicorp (NZ) Ltd appraisal system</li>
<li>regular teacher reflection and follow up discussions with centre managers</li>
<li>fortnightly visits and monthly reports by the Professional Service Managers</li>
<li>ongoing professional development for the teachers on self review and appraisal provided by Kidicorp (NZ) Ltd.</li>
</ul><p>A comprehensive review of the centre philosophy involved consultation with parents/wh&#257;nau and teachers. The new philosophy has been agreed and is promoted throughout the centre. Leaders and teachers have reviewed the impact of the philosophy on the programme, and have identified a need to embed it in assessment, planning and evaluation practices.</p><p>Teachers undertake extensive professional learning and development which has supported them to strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation. Children&rsquo;s individual learning profiles are now more focussed on identifying children&rsquo;s learning, progress and development. Teachers are increasingly using assessment data information to inform their teaching practice.</p><p>A new planning process has been developed. This identifies children&rsquo;s shared interests that teachers specifically plan to extend and enhance. The planning is displayed so that parents have the opportunity to contribute their ideas and aspirations. This collaborative approach allows teachers, parents and children to respond and contribute to the programme on a daily basis.</p><p>Positive and respectful interactions occur between teachers and children. Teachers encourage and support children&rsquo;s independence and self care skills. They provide many opportunities for children to choose from a wide range of activities and resources. Teachers use an appropriate range of strategies to support children to develop their social skills including role modelling, redirection, explanation and offering alternatives. A review of centre procedures has resulted in a more consistent use of these useful strategies. While ERO observed examples of teaching practice that engaged and extended children&rsquo;s learning and thinking, there is a need for this to be more consistent throughout the centre.</p><p>The centre has established effective processes to ensure that appropriate teacher/child ratios are maintained at all times, particularly in the nursery room.</p><h3>Areas for further improvement</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that a key next step to further improve outcomes for children is to develop and implement an agreed understanding of effective teaching practices at Kids to Five Puketaha.</p><p>Consideration should also be given to:</p><p>further developing teacher understanding of the need for robust self review in contributing to positive outcomes for children</p><p>developing self review indicators that are informed by research and based on current best practice in early childhood education</p><p>refining assessment, planning and evaluation practices including:</p><ul>
<li>more consistently identifying the learning in documented assessment portfolios</li>
<li>linking individual assessments to show progress and development</li>
<li>developing useful systems to allow teachers to share with each other the educational outcomes of assessment.</li>
</ul><a id="3-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p><p>Graham Randell National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>4 September 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Service</h2><table>
