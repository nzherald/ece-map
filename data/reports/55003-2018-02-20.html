</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Childcare and Education Centre is located in Gisborne. It is licensed to provide all day education and care for 35 children, including eight up to two years old. High adult-to-child ratios support positive interactions between staff and children. The centre is governed by a committee representing the Central Baptist Church, parents and teachers.</p><p>There is a well-established partnership with the Baptist Church, which adjoins the centre.</p><p>The centre's curriculum is based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. It is Christian based and increasingly the world of Māori is recognised and celebrated.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Care is a key element in the philosophy and is very evident in practice. Children’s physical and emotional wellbeing are well supported. The centre philosophy reflects a commitment to building strong and respectful relationships with each family and promoting children’s sense of belonging. These values are evident.</p><p>A nurturing culture is evident throughout the centre. Children’s physical and emotional needs are recognised and responded to in a timely and caring manner. Routines are well-understood by children and used efficiently and effectively by adults to foster children’s social and self-management skills, and to develop their sense of belonging. Considerate behaviour is expected from adults and children.</p><p>Children enjoy the high quality learning environment. The design enables space to be well used. The wide range of activities and resources available enables children to investigate their interests and ideas.</p><p>The outdoor area offers challenges and opportunities for children to extend their learning. They actively explore a variety of play spaces. Inside is a well-considered space for children to read, play quietly and to explore the interesting science table.</p><p>Good relationships with parents are evident. Teachers greet and discuss the child's disposition. With the newly introduced electronic profile books, there is increased parent response to stories about their children's learning.</p><p>Teachers know their children and families well and this helps to build a sense of belonging and shared identity. Teachers increasingly support children’s learning through active listening, sustained conversations, and questioning techniques to help them develop their thinking skills and theories about the world around them. A next step is for all teachers to recognise the benefit of extended conversation to support all children’s language development for learning.</p><p>For some children English is their second language. Teachers are considering ways to better engage with and support these children within the centre programme.</p><p>Not all teachers take advantage of the opportunities to help children from the range of cultures to learn valued skills and knowledge, such as language, oral traditions and story-telling in their own culture.</p><p>While teachers meet fortnightly to plan for children's learning, little is documented. Consequently, not all teachers use deliberate teaching strategies to focus on learning. Assessment in children’s profile books is attractively presented and shows the wide range of activities available. Teachers have begun to evaluate learning stories on a termly basis to show learning progressions over time.</p><p>Most days there are usually four or five children up to the age of two years. Care is strongly evident. They have their own space and can move to various parts of the centre. The next step is to better provide a more specific, planned programme for progressive learning.</p><p>Most children identify as Māori and many speak te reo Māori. Their culture is recognised and celebrated. Teachers have had professional development linked to local early history and landmarks. The centre's pepeha recognises this place. Children know waiata and recently successfully participated in the local kapa haka festival. Leaders are continually building on resources that reinforce Māori children’s sense of belonging.</p><p>Relationships with local schools are developing, enabling children and families to be supported in their transition to school.</p><p>The appraisal process is yet to be documented to be consistent with the good practice evident. Teachers with curriculum responsibilities inquire effectively into their practice. This process should be followed at centre level where currently the self-review approach is more reflective than evaluative.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to develop planning, assessment and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure the programme deepens the focus on language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop shared understanding and use of internal evaluation practices as a way of knowing how effectively children’s learning is extended.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Childcare and Education Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Childcare and Education Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>20 February 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
