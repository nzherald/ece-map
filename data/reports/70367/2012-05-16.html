<html><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">The Hoon Hay Community Pre-School is a community-based centre managed by teachers and parents. The Christchurch City Council owns the centre building and property which is leased by the centre. The supervisor and management committee report to the council about the high quality of education they provide to children and the valued support they offer to families. The preschool caters for children from birth to five years old.</p><p align="left">The long-established teaching team places a strong focus on building positive and inclusive relationships with children and families. Parent aspirations for their children are valued and used to plan for children&rsquo;s learning and development. Teachers model care and respect for one another and for the children and their families.</p><p align="left">Teachers have also built effective links with the community, local schools and specialist agencies to provide additional support for children and their families. They demonstrate consistent and appropriate practices that are culturally responsive.</p><p align="left">Children benefit from long periods of uninterrupted time to make their own choices in the programme and develop their learning interests. Teachers use a range of effective teaching practices that enable children to take responsibility and encourage their thinking and problem-solving skills. Teachers place an appropriate emphasis on developing children&rsquo;s social skills, oral language and literacy understandings.</p><p align="left">Children have easy access to a wide range of purposefully presented learning experiences within well-organised learning areas. They make good use of the plentiful resources outside to develop their physical skills and to learn about the natural world and sustainable practices.</p><p align="left">Teachers regularly document children&rsquo;s learning and participation in the programme in attractively presented profile books and informative wall displays.</p><p align="left">The preschool is well led and managed. The supervisor and teachers have developed a reflective culture and make effective use of self review to continually inform and improve their practices. They have identified that the next steps for the preschool are to further develop ways of planning for individual children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Hoon Hay Community Pre-School was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atHoon Hay Community Pre-School.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The philosophy states that teachers value each child&rsquo;s identity, language and culture through encouraging communication that values responsive and reciprocal relationships with the whole family/wh&#257;nau. Teachers provide a child-initiated, well-rounded programme within a safe, caring and stimulating environment. This is guided by Te Wh&#257;riki, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left">Teachers, children and families share positive, inclusive and respectful relationships. These relationships are a strong focus of the centre philosophy and are clearly evident in teaching practice. Teachers know children and their families well and make meaningful links between children&rsquo;s homes and the centre&rsquo;s learning environment. They provide and encourage supportive relationships within the centre and the community that promote positive outcomes for children and families.</p><p align="left">Children benefit from caring and nurturing interactions with teachers. ERO observed children who played well with and alongside others. Some children shared and developed ideas with one another and played cooperatively for long periods of time.</p><p align="left">Teachers use appropriate practices that are culturally responsive to individual children and families. They work effectively together and regularly share information to support children&rsquo;s learning and well-being.</p><p align="left">The supervisor has built professional relationships with local schools to share information about children&rsquo;s learning. This helps children make a positive transition to school.</p><p align="left">Teachers use a range of effective teaching practices to enable children to take responsibility for themselves and their learning. They involve children in in-depth conversations that develop children&rsquo;s oral language and extend children&rsquo;s thinking and problem-solving skills.</p><p align="left">Teachers are reflective and have a shared understanding of how best to provide positive outcomes for children and families. They regularly share information with parents to support children&rsquo;s learning and well-being. Children&rsquo;s well-presented profile books regularly detail their learning interests and participation in the programme. However these books could be made more easily accessible for children.</p><p align="left">Children benefit from long periods of uninterrupted time to make their own choices in the programme and develop their own interests.</p><p align="left">Children are actively involved in well-organised and attractive curriculum areas. They have many opportunities to enjoy physical challenges and learn about the natural world and sustainable practices. Children&rsquo;s home cultures are well represented and valued in the attractive and informative wall displays. All children have many opportunities to experience the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa, New Zealand.</p><p align="left">The centre is well led and managed. The supervisor and teachers have developed a reflective culture and make effective use of self review to continually inform and improve their practices. They demonstrate a shared understanding of the strong vision they have to promote positive outcomes for children and families.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">The supervisor and teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that they need to continue to review and further develop the curriculum to increase opportunities for children&rsquo;s personalised learning. Priority should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>more clearly showing progress of individual children&rsquo;s learning over time</li>
<li>further strengthening parent and child contributions to assessments</li>
<li>continuing to evaluate the impact of teaching strategies for individual children.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Hoon Hay Community Pre-School completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

The Christchurch City Council owns the centre building and property which is leased by the centre. The supervisor and management committee report to the council about the high quality of education they provide to children and the valued support they offer to families. The preschool caters for children from birth to five years old.</p><p align="left">The long-established teaching team places a strong focus on building positive and inclusive relationships with children and families. Parent aspirations for their children are valued and used to plan for children&rsquo;s learning and development. Teachers model care and respect for one another and for the children and their families.</p><p align="left">Teachers have also built effective links with the community, local schools and specialist agencies to provide additional support for children and their families. They demonstrate consistent and appropriate practices that are culturally responsive.</p><p align="left">Children benefit from long periods of uninterrupted time to make their own choices in the programme and develop their learning interests. Teachers use a range of effective teaching practices that enable children to take responsibility and encourage their thinking and problem-solving skills. Teachers place an appropriate emphasis on developing children&rsquo;s social skills, oral language and literacy understandings.</p><p align="left">Children have easy access to a wide range of purposefully presented learning experiences within well-organised learning areas. They make good use of the plentiful resources outside to develop their physical skills and to learn about the natural world and sustainable practices.</p><p align="left">Teachers regularly document children&rsquo;s learning and participation in the programme in attractively presented profile books and informative wall displays.</p><p align="left">The preschool is well led and managed. The supervisor and teachers have developed a reflective culture and make effective use of self review to continually inform and improve their practices. They have identified that the next steps for the preschool are to further develop ways of planning for individual children.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p align="left"><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p align="left"><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p align="left"><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
