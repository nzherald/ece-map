</table><p>Springsland Kindergarten is <em>Well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Springlands Kindergarten is one of seven kindergartens administered by Marlborough Kindergarten Association. A general manager oversees the association under the governance of an active, supportive and future-focused board.</p><p>The general manager is responsible for the operation of the kindergartens. The Association’s senior teacher provides advice and guidance for teachers on the curriculum, teaching practices and the running of the kindergarten. The head teacher manages the day to day operation of the kindergarten. All teachers are qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>Springlands Kindergarten is located within the local school grounds and has access to school facilities. It has attractive indoor and outdoor areas that encourage exploration and challenge. A feature of the kindergarten is the focus on learning about and caring for the environment.</p><p>The association and teachers have responded positively to the recommendations in the March 2011 ERO report. Self review processes and long term plans have been improved. Teachers have received detailed feedback about the quality of their assessments of children’s learning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Marlborough Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten’s recently reviewed philosophy is attractively presented and actively implemented in practices and programmes. Children and their families are warmly welcomed into the kindergarten. Teachers know children well and regularly make links with children’s homes and cultures.</p><p>Children learn and play in a settled, calm environment. They are respectful of the wide range of motivating resources and activities that are easily accessible for them.</p><p>The experienced teaching team are very responsive to children and support their participation in activities. They use a wide range of strategies to engage children. Literacy and numeracy activities are spontaneously included throughout the day. Teachers make very good use of local expertise and resources to extend children’s learning. Children’s assessments capture their interests and active involvement in the programme. They also have many opportunities to learn about and use New Zealand Sign Language as part of the everyday programme.</p><p>Teachers work well together. They are reflective and regularly discuss children’s emerging interests and ways for improving outcomes for individual children. The head teacher is developing a collaborative leadership approach and makes good use of teacher’s strengths and interests.</p><p>Teachers have close links with the local community. Parents are supportive and take an active part in the programme and additional activities.</p><p>Children’s positive transition to school is well supported by the strong reciprocal relationships with the school staff and pupils. Parents and children are provided with comprehensive information about local schools and the transition process. Transitions into the kindergarten are flexible to meet children’s and family needs.</p><p>A recent review of biculturalism across the Association has identified that teachers have an understanding of bicultural practices and are increasing their use of te reo and tikanga Māori. Children’s understanding of te reo and tikanga Māori is strengthened through the regular sessions provided by an external facilitator.</p><p>The Association’s specialist teacher provides targeted support for individual children and works with teachers to help with strategies for particular individual and groups of children.</p><p>The Marlborough Kindergarten Association provides high levels of direction and support for managers and teachers. Managers ensure that teachers have access to a wide range of professional learning and development opportunities.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO report, the managers have undertaken a thorough review of self-review practices. They have identified that this is an ongoing area to continue to develop. Teachers’ understanding of self review is increasing. The useful and recently introduced self review format is helping teachers focus on how they can improve learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The Association’s long term plan gives clear direction and identifies specific priorities that are improvement focused. Springlands Kindergarten’s annual plan could be more specific and include detailed short and long term goals.</p><p>The Marlborough Kindergarten Association has a comprehensive policy and procedure framework in place to provide clear expectations for kindergarten operations and the monitoring of health and safety.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager and senior teacher have identified, and ERO agrees, that assessment of children’s learning needs to be strengthened. Teachers now need to consistently:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>identify the learning that is happening for individual children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extend the ways they include parent and children’s views about learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify the role of the teacher and what they will do to support children’s future learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers also need to continue to develop the new planning system to show how children’s emerging interests are being met.</p><p>The Association is currently reviewing the existing appraisal process. Managers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the process needs to be further developed. This should include more robust and formal feedback for teachers about how they can extend their teaching practices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Springlands Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Springlands Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>19 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"> ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
