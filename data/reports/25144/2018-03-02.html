</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Haumia Early Childhood Centre is licensed for 34 children including up to 20 under two years of age. It was established to provide support for mothers in the local Teen Parent Unit at Tangaroa College. Teachers' education and care for children is guided by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Since the 2014 ERO review there has been a change of centre manager and the appointment of a new support person from ECE Management.</p><p>The 2014 ERO report highlighted several areas of strength which have been well sustained over time. Progress against development recommendations have been well documented. The new leadership team has identified strategic ways to continue the focus on successful learning for Māori and Pacific children. They continue to strengthen their links with local schools and provide challenging learning experiences to engage, support and extend children's learning.</p><p>The centre has a strong commitment to the principle of partnership inherent in Te Tiriti o Waitangi. There is an expectation that adults and children will gain an understanding of te reo and tikanga Māori while maintaining strength in their own language, culture and identity.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are warmly welcomed on arrival and quickly settle at an activity of interest. They are happy and relaxed. Children share caring relationships with teachers and benefit from the family-like environment. Flexible transitions between rooms provide children with a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>Children are learning to work cooperatively with each other. They actively engage in social play, and enjoy the gardening activities in the outdoor area. Many engage well in meaningful conversations with teachers who affirm and prompt their ideas. They independently have access to an increasing variety of resources and often explore them in small groups.</p><p>Children benefit from the culturally inclusive environment that fosters their sense of belonging and wellbeing. Their learning is enriched with special programmes that include excursions into the community.</p><p>Teaching practices acknowledge and celebrate children's family cultures and languages. Teachers skilfully integrate te reo Māori and Gagana Samoa in their conversations with children.</p><p>The new centre manager has been leading developments in planning, assessment and evaluation. Teachers' planning now has a greater focus on children’s emerging interests, strengths and learning. Teachers are identifying ways to challenge and further extend children’s interests. They recognise that they can further enhance their teaching practices by providing more detail of the intended learning in children's individual learning stories.</p><p>Teachers are gaining a shared understanding about evaluation and its links to planning and assessment in order to further extend children's learning. The centre manager has appropriately identified that a next step is to continue improvements with teachers' assessment practices. Some good practices where children’s individual progress and development is captured over time are evident. Adults value and recognise the strengths that children bring to their learning.</p><p>Parents are very pleased with the welcome and support their children receive. They appreciate frequent feedback, the opportunities for siblings to play together and the recognition of their family needs. A strategic goal for centre leaders is to have access to a transport van to improve parents’ involvement and commitment to their children's early learning education. Teachers could continue to encourage parents as active partners in their child’s learning.</p><p>The centre is well managed. The new manager, in a short period of time, has appropriately prioritised and progressed centre developments. While she has been supported by ECE management, her expertise, skilful reflective practice and positive attitude has enabled the centre to function efficiently during a challenging year. The team has used its teaching philosophy and outcomes of annual goals to guide their practices and contribute to the centre’s strategic goals. Feedback and discussion with the ECE manager prompts ongoing improvement and encourages teachers to critically reflect on their practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders have identified useful next steps for ongoing centre development. These include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>develop the quality of planning, evaluation and assessment and identifying how they help teachers to extend children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve teachers' understanding and use of internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review teachers' appraisal processes to ensure there are clear links to teachers' professional standards.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Haumia Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Haumia Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>2 March 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
