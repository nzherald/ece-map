</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Pleasant Point Preschool, Nursery and Kindergarten is a privately-owned early childhood service licensed for 65 children up to school age. Teachers provide education programmes for different aged children in three rooms. Each has a separate outdoor play area. The centre is in a converted school building next to Pleasant Point Primary School and is entering its 5th year of operation. The leadership team of one manager and three key teachers works closely with the owner toward a shared vision to provide high quality education and care for children.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2011, the service has made very good progress in the areas ERO identified at that time as needing further development. These included strategic planning, and assessing and planning for children’s learning. The areas identified as strengths in the 2011 ERO report continue to be strengths.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families benefit from the positive relationships they have with the teachers and each other at the centre. The teachers are supportive, caring and respectful and model these behaviours for children. Children show a strong sense of belonging and many have formed close relationships within the centre. Children confidently explore the wide range of activities and experiences the teachers purposefully provide to support their developing needs and interests.</p><p>All teachers have a shared understanding of what the owners’ expectations are for teaching and learning. They are enthusiastic in their work and motivated to continuously build their practices. They respond to children’s needs and interests. Children are comfortable to approach teachers to share their ideas and ask for help. Teachers respect the child’s choice and preferences.</p><p>Teachers notice the interests, passions and challenges of individual children. They identify the learning happening through the child’s play and then develop a response plan aimed at promoting and extending learning. Parents’ views are sought and valued and their ideas used to help teachers plan the learning programme. Teachers effectively integrate mathematics and literacy learning into the day’s activities. They are committed to supporting children to be familiar with New Zealand’s bicultural heritage and have begun to integrate Māori perspectives into the programme.</p><p>Other features of the service that positively impact on children include:</p><ul>
<li>the spacious and attractive indoor and outdoor environment and wide range of accessible, resources</li>
<li>the way teachers encourage children to problem solve and take responsibility for managing themselves</li>
<li>the high-quality care the infant children receive within a safe and calm learning environment.</li>
</ul><p>A new centre manager has recently been appointed to take responsibility for the quality of teaching and learning across the service. She and the key teachers are working to build high quality practice and achieve consistency. They have begun to identify where planning and assessment practices can be further developed to add more depth and complexity to children’s learning.</p><p>The teachers say the owner is responsive to their requests and requirements. She has high expectations for the teaching team and values their commitment and passion for children. The owner and manager empower teachers to become leaders. The teachers are involved in goal setting and decision making. They have been very responsive to new learning from the professional development they have attended. They apply this new learning in their daily practice with positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Self-review systems and processes have been well established and embedded. This supports the ongoing development of systems to ensure the effective operation of the centre and of teaching practice. It is evident that the process is useful, encourages discussions and has a positive impact on outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO agrees with the next steps for the centre identified by the owner, manager and key teachers. These include continuing to develop:</p><ul>
<li>leadership and reporting systems</li>
<li>bicultural practice and the integration of Māori perspectives</li>
<li>programme planning and evaluation</li>
<li>the evaluative component of their self-review processes, including how they assess the impact of change on children’s learning.</li>
</ul><p>The leadership team is also in the process of developing a new strategic plan. The leaders aim to better identify the centre’s key beliefs and aims. These need to link to the centre philosophy. The annual plan needs to show how these aspirations will be achieved over time.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Pleasant Point Preschool, Nursery and Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Pleasant Point Preschool, Nursery and Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer-Southern</p><p>27 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
