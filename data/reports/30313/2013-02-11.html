<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Kindy Tots is well placed to promote and sustain positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Kindy Totz is a privately owned education and care service located in Queenwood, Hamilton. It is licensed for 30 children aged from two to three and half years, and offers all day and sessional programmes. It is one of four centres that operate under a common management structure. The centre employs fully trained, registered teachers. Teacher-child ratios exceed the minimum requirement.</p><p>Previous ERO reports show that the centre has consistently provided good quality education and care for children. Since the 2010 ERO review a new centre supervisor and two new teachers have been appointed. This teaching team has made significant progress in assessment, planning and evaluation which was identified as an area for development, in the previous ERO review.</p><p>The centre promotes a semi-structured programme where teachers provide opportunities for children to experiment with tools and develop skills and knowledge. In addition, the programme places a strong emphasis on literacy and numeracy which is increasingly integrated into &lsquo;topics of interest' and children&rsquo;s play.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>The centre owner continues to provide clear, focused strategic direction for teachers, parents and children. Her professional leadership and guidance ensures the centre programme and practices are aligned and consistent across all four centres. The owner&rsquo;s participation and effective communication has resulted in positive and respectful relationships amongst staff, parents and children. Her management approach is contributing to forward thinking centre development and promoting positive educational opportunities for children.</p><p>The enthusiastic and motivated centre supervisor promotes and supports the service&rsquo;s philosophy. She has focused on building and establishing a cohesive teaching team and strengthening partnerships with parents and families. Through an effective self-review process, and with support from the owner, she has refined and strengthened the centre&rsquo;s philosophy and assessment, planning and evaluation practice. Centre leaders have agreed to undertake a review of culture and identity across all centres' to enhance the safe and inclusive culture that is evident in the programme.</p><p>Teachers have established a clear and well documented assessment framework. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>regular observation of children&rsquo;s involvement in activities</li>
<li>clear links to programme planning</li>
<li>goals for children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>a children&rsquo;s learning progress summary</li>
<li>termly parent evenings where children&rsquo;s learning is shared and aspirations are requested from parents</li>
<li>portfolios moving from skill-based evaluation to include a more learning focused description of children&rsquo;s play.</li>
</ul><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that there would be benefit in accessing external professional development to:</p><ul>
<li>assist teachers to further develop strategies to focus on children&rsquo;s interests and learning dispositions</li>
<li>further enhance teaching practices to assist them to work more effectively and consistently within this context.</li>
</ul><p>The teaching team have established positive and respectful relationships with children and parents. They are very reflective and responsive to children and use a range of strategies to engage children in sustained and purposeful activities. Teachers know children well and involve them in meaningful conversations that support their oral language and social development.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindy Totz completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>11 February 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
