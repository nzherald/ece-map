</table><p>Kea Kids Childcare managers and teachers would benefit from external support to improve the quality of programmes for children, and to ensure all legal requirements are met.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kea Kids Childcare, previously known as Pukeko Park Childcare Centre, is the newest of four centres owned and operated by Ferns Education Limited. The centre has been designed to provide care and education for up to 73 children. It operates across three separate rooms that cater for three different age groups, including up to 13 children under two years of age.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO report, the Family Trust that owns the centre has employed a new centre manager who works with three team leaders and their teaching teams. All of the teaching team are registered teachers. A mentoring and coaching system has been introduced. Improvement in the quality of teaching and learning has progressed slowly. Further challenge is required to support children’s learning and their development as life-long learners. Programme evaluation could be strengthened.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are settled and are learning to manage their own needs. They are provided with activities and opportunities that broaden their educational experience and their knowledge about the local community. They play happily and have a sense of belonging in the centre. Care is taken to ensure children’s smooth transitions into the centre, between rooms and on to school.</p><p>The programme is inclusive. Teachers view all children as having the right to learn and meet their full potential. Children’s cultural backgrounds are valued. Teachers recognise the place of Māori as tangata whenua of Aotearoa and their unique cultural history based on whakapapa relationships. This awareness is included in tikanga and karakia practices.</p><p>Children engage well in the programme. However, consideration should now be given to the balance between more structured teacher-directed approaches and opportunities for children to engage in spontaneous and self-directed play. Some periods of free play allow children to be more interactive, to follow their own interests and take responsibility for the learning environment. Extending this aspect of the curriculum planning could enable children to further develop their selfmanagement skills, and increase opportunities for creativity and exploration.</p><p>While teachers have participated in extensive professional training to develop planning and assessment, plans and strategies to extend children’s interests are not yet evident. Children’s and parents’ contribution to planning is invited. Parents are involved in centre events and fundraising, and willingly contribute their help to the programme. A useful next step would be to further develop processes for documenting children's learning outcomes to more clearly show their progress and development. This would also enable teachers to better evaluate the effectiveness of the centre curriculum in promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Opportunities are provided to support teachers to meet full teacher registration requirements. The owner/manager is on target to ensure that the centre meets the requirements of the Vulnerable Children’s Act 2014.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner/manager agrees that priorities for centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>aligning appraisal processes to the <em>Practising Teacher Criteria</em>, job descriptions, strategic goals and the centre philosophy</li>
<li>embedding complex learning in the programme and strengthening alignment with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum</li>
<li>continuing to develop leadership capability</li>
<li>reviewing health and safety procedures to ensure requirements are met.</li>
</ul><p>All areas of centre operations should be reviewed against legal requirements and indicators of best practice in early childhood education.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kea Kids Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to curriculum, management and health and safety practices. To meet requirements the service needs to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>meet all health and safety requirements, including police vetting of non-registered staff and volunteers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>plan, implement and evaluate a curriculum designed to enhance children’s learning that is consistent with <em>Te Whāriki.</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008, 43(1a); 46(1a); (1)(a); C1,2,4,6,9.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kea Kids Childcare will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>27 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
