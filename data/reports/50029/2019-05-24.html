</table><p>Lalanga Moui Tongan Early Childhood Centre requires further development to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>The service needs support to further develop the quality of the programme, teaching and learning, and in the areas of governance, management and administration.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lalanga Mou'i childcare centre in Palmerston North operates as a not-for-profit charitable trust. It provides education and care for children from babies and up to five years of age. The programme is based on a total immersion Tongan language model within a Christian ethos. The centre is governed by the Talakaepau 'O e Meliniume Society Incorporated and a management committee of Lalanga Mou'i, which includes the centre manager and all the staff.</p><p>The long serving licensee/centre manager oversees the centre's daily operations. The curriculum is managed by the supervisor, who is supported by qualified and unqualified teachers. A cook, a maintenance man/van driver and two office administrators complete the team.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report, noted the richness of the use of Tongan language, and that children were deeply immersed in their culture. This continues to be a key feature. Staff have made some progress in addressing areas for improvement in the last report. However, there is still some work to be done to address the areas in operations and administration, the quality of programme planning and evaluation, and professional practice.</p><p>SELO support has been working with the service for two years and improvements have been made. Some areas of practice for the centre managers still require clarification regarding aspects of policy development, implementation and evaluation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are friendly and welcoming. They have a strong sense of belonging. Older children accept responsibility for supporting and encouraging younger children. They are aware and respectful of some cultural behaviours. Children are familiar with routines and confidently ask for assistance from staff. They make choices for their play and are open to new experiences and challenges.</p><p>The three separate dwellings have an ease of indoor and outdoor flow. Some recently acquired resources have contributed to supporting children’s play and learning. Staff arrange and display photos and resources at children’s level. These promote and encourage conversations and language development. Children come together for lotu at morning mat-time. They enjoy this session and participate enthusiastically with the interactive music and movement.</p><p>Staff are caring, and some good teaching practices are being modelled. Staff have positive interactions with children. Records of children's learning have improved. These show children's development goals and progress of learning overtime. Staff are finding ways to further improve planning and assessments. Such developments should help to raise the quality of the programme.</p><p>The supervisor works with staff to develop the programme for children. Regular teacher meetings support a collaborative approach to designing a curriculum that promotes language development and Tongan language acquisition. Teachers and leaders have worked extensively with an external provider to translate into Tongan, <em>Te Whāriki</em> the early childhood curriculum. They have adopted the Kakala framework, a Tongan internal evaluation method, and Kaliloa Mafana to evaluate the quality of learning and development for children. These frameworks have yet to be embedded.</p><p>Some good management systems have been established. The centre leaders and staff have developed operational plans that provide information of the centre’s current and future direction. They now need to develop an annual plan that explicitly details priorities and identifies people responsible to action priorities. Professional development focused on management, and teaching and learning is currently delivered by an external provider. The management committee will require ongoing support to make the improvements required at all levels of operations.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for the management committee is to work with professional external support to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensure that there are sufficient registered teachers to meet licensing requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop clear systems for governance, management and administration to meet minimum requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>prioritise the review of personnel management policies and procedures, and develop systems that provide clear guidelines for staff that meet New Zealand Labour Department requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a robust process for managing staff performance aligned to Teaching Council requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop an annual plan that guides development, and provide a basis for regular and systematic self review for ongoing improvements.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Key next steps for teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>use internal evaluation more effectively for improving the learning environment, learning programmes and quality of teaching practices,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to strengthen the documentation of assessment, planning and evaluation of children's learning and development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build on their pedagogical content knowledge in working with children up to two years</p>
</li>
<li>evaluate the effectiveness of the provision for transitioning children through the centre and on to school, and how this provision aligns to <em>Te Whāriki</em> the early childhood curriculum.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lalanga Moui Tongan Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to governance, management and administration. To meet requirements, the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>practices of adults providing education and care demonstrate an understanding of children's learning and development, and knowledge of relevant theories and practices in early childhood education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing and implementing an effective staff appraisal process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adequately staffing the centre with sufficient qualified and registered staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring effective management systems, policies and procedures clearly guide operational practices, and teaching and learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, C4, GMA7, The Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008. Regulations 47 (1), (2).</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>24 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
