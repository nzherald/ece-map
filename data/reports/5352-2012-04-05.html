<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2>
<p>Johnsonville Full Day Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p>Relationships with families are regarded as pivotal to the success of the kindergarten and parents are clearly considered the first teachers of their children. Teachers and parents implement an effective approach to support families&rsquo; transition into and out of the kindergarten. Staff warmly welcome parents and encourage them to take an active interest in their child&rsquo;s learning. Cultural backgrounds of families are acknowledged and highly respected.</p>
<p>The child-centred programme appropriately reflects the centre&rsquo;s philosophy of fostering kindness and respectful relationships. The family-oriented kindergarten effectively responds to the aspirations of its community. Teachers are gentle and responsive to children&rsquo;s needs and skilfully support their learning. Expectations for behaviour are clear, flexible routines are established and a calm tone is consistently maintained. Children are happy, confidently approach adults and show high levels of support for each other.</p>
<p>The spacious kindergarten has high quality indoor and outdoor environments. Much attention is paid to aesthetics with a strong focus on nature and natural materials. A peaceful yet purposeful atmosphere prevails. Biculturalism is strongly reflected in the environment and curriculum and there is a genuine commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi. A strong sense of tuakana/teina is evident as children teach and support each other.</p>
<p>The large teaching team is ably led and staff are encouraged to focus on implementing high quality, reflective practice. Teachers complement each other with their range of skills and expertise and work collaboratively. Staff place considerable importance on their shared vision to nurture &lsquo;the mana of the child and sustain their sense of wonder&rsquo;. They have set appropriate goals for further review and development. These include enhancing the usefulness of self review and improving their confidence in using te reo M&#257;ori.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Johnsonville Full Day Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atJohnsonville Full Day Kindergarten.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p>
<ul><li>association support</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Since the June 2008 ERO review, the kindergarten has restructured and introduced a distributed leadership model. The expanded teaching team has improved the teacher to child ratios. The established staff comprises a senior head teacher, assistant head teacher and seven teachers.</p>
<p>Environment upgrades consist of building renovations, including a sleep area, quiet rooms and private spaces for children to explore, and extensive outdoor garden enhancements.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>Interactions Teachers are gentle and responsive to children&rsquo;s needs. They use skilful strategies to support well-being and encourage independence. Relationships are mutually respectful and affectionate. Teachers maximise opportunities to encourage children&rsquo;s learning. High levels of shared dialogue, appropriate questioning and one-to-one interactions extend children&rsquo;s thinking, reasoning and problem solving. Expectations for behaviour are clear, flexible routines are established and a calm tone is consistently maintained. Children are happy, confidently approach adults and show high levels of support for each other.</p>
<p>Learning environmentThe spacious kindergarten has high quality indoor and outdoor environments to support children&rsquo;s early learning. An extensive range of resources, including information and communication technologies, is freely accessed and explored. Much attention is paid to aesthetics, with a strong focus on nature and natural materials. A peaceful yet purposeful atmosphere prevails.</p>
<p>Programme The child-centred programme appropriately reflects the centre&rsquo;s philosophy of fostering manaakitanga and whanaungatanga. The family-oriented kindergarten effectively responds to the aspirations and needs of its community. Features include following the rhythms of children, appreciation and exploration of Papa-t&#363;-&#257;-nuku and promoting children&rsquo;s holistic well-being and learning.</p>
<p>High quality oral and written literacy, mathematical and natural science experiences are interwoven throughout the programme and environment.</p>
<p>Portfolios are shared and celebrated and contain good narrations of children&rsquo;s dispositions. They are regularly monitored to ensure there are multiple perspectives. Since the introduction of Te Manawa: the association&rsquo;s Criteria for Curriculum Implementation, teachers are more effectively documenting children&rsquo;s significant learning, ensuring there are explicit links between aspirations and what learning is occurring.</p>
<p>Biculturalism Teachers show a genuine commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi. Tikanga is strongly reflected in the environment and curriculum. A special leaving ceremony with a korowai (cloak) is a highlight for children and reinforces the importance of their learning journey at the kindergarten. Children confidently give their mihi and say karakia before kai. A strong sense of tuakana/teina is evident as children teach and support each other.</p>
<p>MulticulturalismTeachers develop a strong rapport with families with non-English speaking backgrounds. Some staff are able to use their own home languages to encourage parents to fully participate in the life of the kindergarten. Families&rsquo; cultural backgrounds are acknowledged and highly respected. Prominent displays of various cultural identities support families to feel welcome.</p>
<p>Home partnerships Relationships with families are regarded as pivotal to the success of the kindergarten and parents are clearly regarded as the first teachers of their children. Teachers undertake home visits. Staff warmly welcome parents and encourage them to take an active interest in their child&rsquo;s learning, including discussing and identifying children&rsquo;s strengths and learning dispositions. Their aspirations for their child are actively sought and revisited. Those children requiring extra assistance are ably supported.</p>
<p>Transitions Children&rsquo;s well-being in transition times is given high priority. Teachers and parents effectively support families&rsquo; transition into and out of the kindergarten. Transition to school is well managed and teachers value building close ties between the kindergarten and local schools. Assessment information is shared with new entrant teachers and clear links are made between Te Wh&#257;riki and The New Zealand Curriculum. Children are provided with activities that reflect the school classroom to assist in a smooth changeover to primary school.</p>
<p>Leadership and teamwork The senior head teacher and assistant head teacher successfully lead the large team in implementing high quality, reflective practice. Regular professional discussions focus on children&rsquo;s interests and strengths and how best to support their learning through responsive programmes. Teachers take leadership roles, complement each other with their range of skills and expertise and work collaboratively. Considerable importance is placed on their shared vision to nurture &lsquo;the mana of the child and sustain their sense of wonder&rsquo;.</p>
<h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p>Self review While a suitable framework supports review and development, the process of self review requires strengthening. Using a targeted evaluative question and analysing evidence in more depth is likely to provide a more robust evaluation of the quality of programmes and practices, enhancing outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Te reo M&#257;ori Teachers have identified the need to increase their confidence in using te reo M&#257;ori as part of their everyday interactions with children. ERO&rsquo;s evaluation affirms this and also suggests that this development step be extended to their written work.</p>
<h3>Association Support</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p>
<p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p>
<p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p>
<h3>Areas of strength</h3>
<p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p>
<ul><li>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</li>
<li>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</li>
<li>a wide range of professional development opportunities</li>
<li>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</li>
</ul><h3>Areas for development and review</h3>
<p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p>
<ul><li>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</li>
<li>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice as a result of feedback</li>
<li>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association strategic priorities.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Johnsonville Full Day Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreManagement Assurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>

<p>To the Parents and Community of Johnsonville Full Day Kindergarten</p>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Johnsonville Full Day Kindergarten.</p>
<p>Johnsonville Full Day Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensee of the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p>Relationships with families are regarded as pivotal to the success of the kindergarten and parents are clearly considered the first teachers of their children. Teachers and parents implement an effective approach to support families&rsquo; transition into and out of the kindergarten. Staff warmly welcome parents and encourage them to take an active interest in their child&rsquo;s learning. Families&rsquo; cultural backgrounds are acknowledged and highly respected.</p>
<p>The child-centred programme appropriately reflects the centre&rsquo;s philosophy of fostering kindness and respectful relationships. The family-oriented kindergarten effectively responds to the aspirations of its community. Teachers are gentle and responsive to children&rsquo;s needs and skilfully support their learning. Expectations for behaviour are clear, flexible routines are established and a calm tone is consistently maintained. Children are happy, confidently approach adults and show high levels of support for each other.</p>
<p>The spacious kindergarten has high quality indoor and outdoor environments. Much attention is paid to aesthetics with a strong focus on nature and natural materials. A peaceful yet purposeful atmosphere prevails. Biculturalism is strongly reflected in the environment and curriculum and there is a genuine commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi. A strong sense of tuakana/teina is evident as children teach and support each other.</p>
<p>The large teaching team is ably led and staff are encouraged to focus on implementing high quality, reflective practice. Teachers complement each other with their range of skills and expertise and work collaboratively. Staff place considerable importance on their shared vision to nurture &lsquo;the mana of the child and sustain their sense of wonder&rsquo;. They have set appropriate goals for further review and development. These include enhancing the usefulness of self review and improving their confidence in using te reo M&#257;ori.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p>
<p>National Evaluation Topics &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p>
<p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
