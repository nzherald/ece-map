</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Avalon Kindergarten is licensed to provide all day education and care for up to 44 children, aged over two years. Sessions run daily during the week, from 8:30am to 2:30pm. Of the total roll of 49, six children are Māori and six are of Pacific heritage. The kindergarten serves a culturally diverse community.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises inclusion and relationships. The teaching team are long-serving. They are all fully qualified.</p><p>Avalon Kindergarten is one of 19 in the Lower Hutt region, governed and managed by Hutt City Kindergarten Association (the association). Since the June 2015 ERO report, a new senior leadership team has been appointed. This includes a general manager and two senior teachers, guided by a team leader. The governance board has also undergone significant changes.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified key next steps for this kindergarten. Good progress has been made in developing internal evaluation processes. Responsiveness to Māori and Pacific learners, and assessment, planning and evaluation practices, remain areas requiring development.</p><p>The association also had some areas for development these included: including strategic planning; cultural response to Māori and Pacific families; evaluation; and the appraisal process. Good progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight in the Hutt City Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from positive, respectful relationships with their teachers and peers. The learning environment is spacious and inviting. Active physical play and nature exploration are encouraged. Teachers are attentive to group interests and provide resources in response. Excursions and events extend the curriculum.</p><p>Children with diverse learning needs are very well supported to engage with the curriculum and their peers. Staff continually build their knowledge and skills in this area, with a range of inclusive strategies and liaison with experts and relevant agencies. This is a strength of the kindergarten.</p><p>The bicultural curriculum requires significant strengthening. The association’s current strategic focus on bicultural practices should support this improvement. Building teachers’ understanding of specific strategies, in partnership with whānau, to promote the learning success of Māori and Pacific children should also be a focus for association leaders.</p><p>Teachers are warm and welcoming to children and their families, and know them well. These relationships should now be extended into learning partnerships to promote valued learning outcomes. Teachers should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>co-construct goals and teaching strategies with parents and whānau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build their understanding of what success looks like for each child's family</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>find ways to reflect each child’s culture in teaching practice and the learning environment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers agree that documentation of the assessment cycle should more strongly demonstrate how planned teaching strategies have purposefully promoted improved learning outcomes. ERO's evaluation affirms the kindergarten's plans for improvement in this area. Individual children’s planning processes should clearly make use of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a robust cycle of assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learning-based conversations with parents and whānau</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ongoing gathering of information about children’s culture, language and identity.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The teaching team are collaborative and improvement-oriented. They are being supported to grow their evaluation practice through very useful association systems and tools. Senior teachers should continue to work with teachers to build their capacity to evaluate the effect of their practice on children’s learning, particularly through the use of measureable indicators of success.</p><p>A comprehensive, well-considered appraisal process is in place. Teachers challenge themselves to continually improve their practice through strategic goal-setting and professional learning. Plans are in place to further strengthen this system by developing an inquiry-based approach to teacher appraisal. ERO's evaluation affirms this direction. This should support teachers to better measure the success of improved practices in promoting outcomes for specific children and priority groups.</p><p>The governance board includes a wide range of community representation and useful skills. The board and senior leadership team work well together, with a shared commitment to meeting its goals and objectives for the benefit of children, whānau and community. Resource allocation clearly aligns with this focus. The board and senior leadership actively seek equitable and inclusive ways to eliminate barriers to children’s learning and wellbeing.</p><p>ERO, the governance board and senior leaders agree that the association's next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>monitor, evaluate and report on the extent to which outcomes for children and their families are improved though systems, processes and initiatives. This should include consideration of impact on specific priority groups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider ways to increase opportunities for whānau to actively contribute to the association’s operation and strategic direction.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association's senior teaching team are reflective and highly improvement focused. Robust, linked systems and processes have been skilfully developed to guide and grow teacher capability and positively impact children’s learning. Leaders are successfully fostering a collective sense of responsibility for the vision, values and mission of the association.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten teachers agree that their priority next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improve practices that promote parent partnerships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build culturally responsive practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and embed an effective cycle of assessment, planning and evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association agrees they should increase focus on:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>measuring outcomes for children and their families</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing whānau and community partnership practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Avalon Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Avalon Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>7 September 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
