</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Footsteps Adventist Christian Preschool is adjacent to Parkside Christian Seventh Day Adventist School. The centre provides all day care for up to 50 children, including six aged under two years. A large spacious building, with two separate rooms and well resourced outdoor spaces, caters for the needs of different age groups.</p><p>The Footsteps Adventist Preschool board of trustees is responsible for the overall governance of the centre. The centre management committee, which includes the centre director, is responsible for the day-to-day running of the centre. The centre director provides leadership and direction for staff. Staffing remains stable and all teachers are qualified.</p><p>Trustees, management and staff have effectively responded to the areas for improvement in the 2010 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are nurtured in an environment that is welcoming and strongly reflects the centre’s philosophy and Christian values. A sense of belonging for children, families and whānau is fostered through positive and responsive relationships. Parents are welcome to stay and join in their children’s play. Their knowledge and skills are valued and they regularly contribute to the learning activities.</p><p>Children engage in a wide range of physical skills and opportunities for group or independent play. The centre environment reflects the multi-cultural backgrounds of the families attending.</p><p>The curriculum is child-centred and based on their interests, strengths and needs. It promotes learning through creative and imaginative play with opportunities to develop early literacy and numeracy concepts. Independence and self-help skills are fostered.</p><p>A high ratio of adults to toddlers caters well for these children's needs and care routines. Free flow between spaces provides opportunities for siblings to interact and for older children to support younger children.</p><p>Children enjoy a range of well-planned and interesting group-learning experiences that integrate science and the arts. They lead their learning and engage in sustained play. Infants and toddlers confidently explore their surroundings and participate in age-appropriate activities. Teachers make the most of learning opportunities within regular routines.</p><p>Some regular use of te reo Māori during activities and routines supports the bicultural curriculum. The centre director recognises that this is an area for ongoing development and is committed to strengthening te reo me ngā tikanga Māori perspectives across all aspects of the curriculum.</p><p>Children’s profile books support improved links between home and the centre. They record children’s learning over time and capture and celebrate special moments. Parents are encouraged to contribute to their child’s learning and are regularly informed of the daily learning activities in the centre. A well planned process is being implemented to ensure that all children’s learning is assessed regularly.</p><p>Children transitioning to school participate in a programme that extends their learning and prepares them for school. Parents are well informed of the schooling options available to them.</p><p>Teachers work collaboratively to improve their teaching practice. Management supports ongoing professional development for staff. The appraisal process identifies goals and provides teachers with useful feedback and next steps to develop their practice.</p><p>A comprehensive strategic plan provides clear direction for the centre. Self review is valued and focused on improving outcomes for children. Further links between indicators, evidence collation and more focus in reviews should strengthen the evaluative aspect of the process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Staff are committed to the ongoing improvement of the service. Managers, leaders, teachers and ERO agree that the next steps to continue to improve positive outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>embedding assessment practices</li>
<li>strengthening teachers' confidence in using te reo me ngā tikanga Māori and strategies to support Māori success as Māori</li>
<li>strengthening self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Footsteps Adventist Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Footsteps Adventist Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><p>1 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
