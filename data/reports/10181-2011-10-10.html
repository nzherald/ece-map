<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Puna Ole Atamai Aoga Amata is located in the grounds of the Southern Cross Campus and is in a complex with four other Pacific early childhood centres. The 2008 ERO report noted that teachers were caring and affirming of children.</p><p>Teachers continue to nurture children&rsquo;s understanding of the Samoan language and culture. They use Samoan consistently in talking with adults and children. Many children are fluent in Samoan. Children&rsquo;s understanding of traditional practices, songs and prayers are fostered through daily lotu. Children join in with confidence and are developing a strong sense of their own cultural identity and are learning respect for others.</p><p>Children are happy and settled in the centre&rsquo;s relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Affirming relationships between staff, children and families are a positive feature of the centre. Children play well alongside each other and confidently seek out the company of staff and peers. They make choices from the available equipment, engage in sustained play, and share their ideas. The environment strongly reflects the Samoan background of most of the children.</p><p>Teachers provide a good quality programme. They value children&rsquo;s play and model a genuine enthusiasm for learning. Teachers are supportive and gracious in their interactions with children and adults. They could increase the use of strategies that extend child-initiated play and provide more opportunities for children to use problem solving and leadership skills.</p><p>The centre has strong connections with families, the local community and the school. The licensee, teachers and the management committee are committed to improving outcomes for children. They are aware they could further develop and improve areas of play and refine aspects of planning. Developing strategic long-term planning, as recommended by ERO in 2008, would assist them in this process.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Puna Ole Atamai Aoga Amata was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atPuna Ole Atamai Aoga Amata.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2005 and 2008 ERO reports noted the good quality of gagana Samoa and interactions based on aganu&rsquo;u Samoa in the centre. These good practices have continued. Both ERO reports suggested improvements in some aspects of the programme and the environment. Improvements have been made and the health and safety issue noted by ERO in 2008 has been addressed.</p><p>Since the 2008 ERO review there have been some changes in staff and a new supervisor has been appointed. Although licensed for children under two years of age, the centre no longer enrols these young children. The area for infants has been redeveloped into a staff room and is used for teacher non-contact time. Plans are in place for further refurbishment of the centre.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Use of Samoan language. Children have a good level of fluency in Samoan language. This language development is fostered through sustained conversations in Samoan between teachers and children. Teachers expect a response from children and prompt them when needed. As a result, children are confident and capable bilingual learners.</p><p>Culture. Children&rsquo;s understanding of Samoan culture is embedded in the programme and fostered through the lotu time held each day. Teachers lead children in traditional practices, songs and prayers and children join in with enthusiasm. Posters, print and wall decorations affirm Samoan identity and culture. These displays also acknowledge the heritage of Maori children and some te reo Maori is included incidentally in the programme. Children&rsquo;s sense of their cultural identity is affirmed.</p><p>Programme. Teachers provide a good quality programme based on gagana Samoa and Christian beliefs. They are respectful, supportive and gracious in their interactions with children and adults. Teachers value children&rsquo;s play and encourage them to participate in a range of planned and child-chosen activities. They incorporate aspects of numeracy, literacy and science into the programme. Children and teachers spontaneously sing and dance throughout the day. Teachers respond quickly to children&rsquo;s interests and preferences as they continue to develop a more child-led programme.</p><p>Outcomes for children. Children are eager learners, socially competent, and play cooperatively with peers. They engage in sustained play, persist at difficult tasks and share their ideas. Children make good use of the newly developed family play areas to engage in imaginative play. They explore natural science in the large attractive science/nature area. Children are developing confidence in their own abilities and those of their peers.</p><p>Assessment and planning. A meaningful and systematic process of assessment, planning and evaluation of the core curriculum is in place. Carefully analysed assessments are used to guide planning that is responsive to children&rsquo;s strengths and interests. Wall displays reflect the current programme focus and provide good information for parents. Children&rsquo;s assessment portfolios provide a carefully documented record of their learning and development in the centre. The portfolios include parent contributions and enhance centre-home partnerships.</p><p><span>Effective management systems.</span> <span>Well documented and effective management systems provide a framework for the smooth operation of the centre. The licensee provides strong professional leadership in the implementation of the centre philosophy, policies and self review.</span> Financial policies are well established and regular staff meetings are held. <span>Clear administration systems, routines and expectations enable teachers to work collaboratively to ensure that children are provided with good quality education and care.</span></p><p>Family/community. The management committee and teachers have positive relationships with the local community and families of children attending. Teachers encourage families to be actively involved in their child&rsquo;s education. Information about the centre and programme is attractively and prominently displayed and newsletters are distributed frequently. Teachers have regular contact with the local schools and support children&rsquo;s transition to school. A strong sense of family and community involvement and support for the aoga amata is evident.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>Learning extension. Although teachers are supportive of children&rsquo;s play, the next steps are to extend child-initiated play and enrich children&rsquo;s learning opportunities. The steps taken should include increasing:</p><ul>
<li>support for the development of children&rsquo;s literacy and numeracy skills for authentic purposes and in the context of play</li>
<li>the use of strategies that promote children&rsquo;s independent thinking, reasoning and problem-solving skills</li>
<li>opportunities for children to take leadership roles in routines and play.</li>
</ul><p>Discussions would be further enriched by the use of more open-ended questions in response to children&rsquo;s ideas and emerging interests in the context of play.</p><p>Environment: Teachers should continue to review and improve how well how each area can extend children&rsquo;s play and learning. Increasing children&rsquo;s independent access to writing and art materials, both indoors and outdoors, would further support children&rsquo;s literacy development. Managers and teachers should improve children&rsquo;s access to the outside area and provide more equipment that supports physical activity and the development of complex play.</p><p>Refining aspects of planning. Teachers are aware that some aspects of the planning cycle could be further developed. Improvements could include:</p><ul>
<li>more consistently showing the continuity and progression of children&rsquo;s individual interests and development over time</li>
<li>involving parents more in assessment and planning</li>
<li>encouraging children to set their own goals and see their progress recorded in their portfolios.</li>
</ul><p>These actions would enhance current good practices.</p><p>Self review. Self review guides teachers&rsquo; decision making, with the support of the improvement-focused management committee. A long-term strategic plan that covers all areas of the programme, the environment and centre operations could now be developed. Linking annual action plans to the strategic plan would help teachers and managers to maintain continuous improvements. Streamlining the appraisal process by focusing it on learning outcomes for children would also contribute positively to the development of the programme.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Inclusion of children with moderate to severe special needs</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>

<li>children with moderate to severe special needs supported to be confident and capable learners</li>
<li>the service is inclusive of children with moderate to severe special needs.</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3><p>Although no children with moderate to severe special needs are currently enrolled in this service, good policies and procedures are in place to their support inclusion.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Teachers have warm welcoming processes and positive relationships with families that support the transition of all children in the centre. A special needs policy is in place to guide centre practices. Information is available for parents about support groups and who to discuss any concerns with. Teachers know how to seek external support for parents and children if necessary.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Puna Ole Atamai Aoga Amata completed an ERO Centre ManagementAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-recommendation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5 Recommendation</h2><p>ERO and the centre managers agree that teachers should continue to develop strategies that challenge and extend children&rsquo;s learning and that encourage children to take leadership roles in routines and as part of their play.</p><a id="6-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6 Future Action</h2><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><a id="about-the-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>About the Centre</h2><table>

The 2008 ERO report noted that teachers were caring and affirming of children.</p><p>Teachers continue to nurture children&rsquo;s understanding of the Samoan language and culture. They use Samoan consistently in talking with adults and children. Many children are fluent in Samoan. Children&rsquo;s understanding of traditional practices, songs and prayers are fostered through daily lotu. Children join in with confidence and are developing a strong sense of their own cultural identity and are learning respect for others.</p><p>Children are happy and settled in the centre&rsquo;s relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Affirming relationships between staff, children and families are a positive feature of the centre. Children play well alongside each other and confidently seek out the company of staff and peers. They make choices from the available equipment, engage in sustained play, and share their ideas. The environment strongly reflects the Samoan background of most of the children.</p><p>Teachers provide a good quality programme. They value children&rsquo;s play and model a genuine enthusiasm for learning. Teachers are supportive and gracious in their interactions with children and adults. They could increase the use of strategies that extend child-initiated play and provide more opportunities for children to use problem solving and leadership skills.</p><p>The centre has strong connections with families, the local community and the school. The licensee, teachers and the management committee are committed to improving outcomes for children. They are aware they could further develop and improve areas of play and refine aspects of planning. Developing strategic long-term planning, as recommended by ERO in 2008, would assist them in this process.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p>National Evaluation Topics &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
