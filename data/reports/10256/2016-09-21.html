</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tongan Tamaki Fe'ofa'aki Preschool is a total immersion Tongan centre. It provides culturally appropriate care and education for up to 20 children including five children under two years. The centre is located at the back of the Lalanga Fonua site, an organisation providing social services for Tongan peoples in the Glen Innes community. The curriculum is embedded in Tongan culture, language and the Christian ethos.</p><p>A board of trustees governs and manages centre operations. A parent committee supports the teachers and the supervisor with fundraising. They meet regularly to discuss events and ways to contribute to the centre's programme. The newly appointed centre supervisor oversees the daily operations, manages the curriculum and mentors staff. A contact person oversees the administrative aspects of the centre.</p><p>Since the 2012 ERO report the centre has been relicensed under the <em>Early Childhood Regulations 2008.</em> The board has accomplished a lot of work related to the development priorities identified in the ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle easily into the centre, are familiar with the centre's routines, and actively participate in the programme. Children are friendly and they play well with their peers. They converse enthusiastically in the Tongan language with adults and other children. Children are confident, independent and they happily engage in activities. Toddlers confidently explore the environment.</p><p>Teachers are respectful of children and they have positive relationships with parents, whānau and the board. Parents contribute to their children’s learning through the informal talanoa they have with teachers during drop off and pick up times. Some parents involve themselves in the daily programme by sharing their skills and experience.</p><p>The supervisor has made improvements to the centre’s learning programme. She guides the teaching team using <em>Te Whariki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The programme is flexible and is culturally appropriate. Teachers model Tongan ways of being, thinking, and behaving. Regular meetings help teachers to develop curriculum planning and assessment practices. Teachers could extend their knowledge and understanding of current theories of children’s learning and development.</p><p>Teachers are committed to the principles of <em>Te Tiriti o Waitangi</em>. Children use te reo Māori during mat times and can sing a variety of Māori waiata. Teachers value and promote Māori children's identity in the centre.</p><p>The centre environment is attractive, with displays that give children affirmation of their identity, culture and language. The mixed age setting gives children a sense of family. Teachers could further review and extend resources and equipment in both the indoor and outdoor environments. The centre could provide a greater variety of good quality resources that challenge children in their learning.</p><p>Teachers are developing their understanding of internal evaluation for positive outcomes of children. They could work with an external adviser to help them to develop robust evaluation processes. Improved use of evaluation would help to strengthen the learning programme and curriculum management. Greater understanding of evaluation would help teachers to reflect more deeply on how well teaching practices and programmes are promoting positive outcomes for children.</p><p>The centre has addressed the development areas identified in the 2012 ERO report and the new board has the capacity to sustain these developments. The board and licensee continue to develop more robust and transparent management practices.</p><p>External professional development for teachers and the board is making an impact on positive outcomes for children. The board and teachers welcome external feedback and they are committed to continually improving. This attitude is well modelled and lead by the dedicated licensee.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for the board and licensee are to develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>clear governance and management role and responsibilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and implement robust appraisal processes for teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an annual action plan and formally document key actions to meet the centre’s strategic goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and review policies and procedures so that they are aligned to current legal requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Key next steps for teachers are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increase their curriculum knowledge so that they can enhance the quality of the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop a systematic approach to assessing children’s progress and learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide further resources to increase the level of challenge and choice for children in the programme.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tongan Tamaki Fe'ofa'aki Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Tongan Tamaki Fe'ofa'aki Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>21 September 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
