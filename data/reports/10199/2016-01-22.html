</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Ward 26A Playroom is part of Starship Children's Health. It is one of eight licensed early childhood services located in Auckland City Hospital and governed by Allied Health Auckland. Ward 26 provides neurological services for children from across New Zealand and the Pacific region. The playroom provides a six-hour programme for children who are patients in the ward. The service is licensed to cater for 10 children from birth to six years of age.</p><p>The playroom is staffed by a qualified early childhood teacher who has additional hospital play specialist (HPS) qualifications. She is supported sometimes by relievers. She works with children in the playroom and hospital ward to implement <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, through planned and responsive learning experiences. The HPS' mission is to support children, siblings and whānau with coping strategies to minimise the impact of hospitalisation and illness.</p><p>A team leader from Allied Health and a practice supervisor, who is also a qualified ECE teacher and play specialist, have responsibility for the daily management of the service. HPS are also part of an mulitdisciplinary team which is made up of a range of healthcare professionals.</p><p>Since ERO's review in 2012, HPS have been involved in ongoing professional learning and development. Internal evaluation processes have been established to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of service operations and teaching programmes for children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The highly skilled HPS quickly establishes respectful, caring and trusting relationships with children and families/whānau. These positive interactions foster a sense of wellbeing and belonging for children and families. The HPS supports children to develop their confidence to understand and contribute to decisions about their learning and what happens to them in hospital.</p><p>The HPS provides responsive and sensitive support. The languages and cultures of children and families are valued and respected. The HPS plans to continue improving how well programmes, resources and practices reflect cultural diversity. She is a strong advocate for the rights of children, their whānau and siblings and is dedicated to reducing stress during their time within the hospital environment.</p><p>Children experience an inclusive, welcoming environment in the playroom. It is thoughtfully prepared to cater for the diverse ages, interests and needs of infants, toddlers and young children. Children have opportunities to develop friendships and enjoy playing with open-ended resources. Healthcare play equipment assists children to engage in medical play. The HPS expertise in therapeutic play supports children to prepare for procedures and treatments.</p><p>The HPS is knowledgeable about <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and uses a wide range of high quality teaching strategies to respond to children's interests, needs and home experiences. A feature of this playroom is the well-established use of an innovative sensory programme called Snoezelen. These sessions support wellbeing and promote relaxation. Group programme records (taonga books) include photographs and stories about children's experiences and learning in the hospital-based setting. Children who return frequently to the hospital are able to revisit their earlier experiences in these taonga books.</p><p>The HPS are reviewing how well programmes and practices reflect the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. Their emphasis has been on improving resources and equipment. Increasing their use of te reo Māori in spontaneous play situations and in written learning assessments could help HPS to improve their bicultural practice. Developing a long-term goal to reflect this service-wide focus would support planned, deliberate improvements over time.</p><p>The HPS team continues to develop shared understandings about effective practice. They regularly participate in team meetings and engage in professional discussions focused on fostering positive outcomes for children and their whānau. Individual skills contribute to team development and professional learning opportunities have added to HPS knowledge.</p><p>The team leader works collaboratively with the practice supervisor to promote improvement. Performance appraisals provide opportunities for HPS to reflect on and develop their practices. Leaders plan to strengthen appraisal by making clearer links to new Education Council requirements.</p><p>Good systems have been established for internal evaluation. HPS seek the views of families to inform improvements. The team leader and practice supervisor have identified ways to build on the significant progress that has been made in this area of practice since the 2012 ERO report.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The team leader and practice supervisor agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>developing annual and long-term educational goals to guide ongoing improvement</li>
<li>improving practices to promote success for Māori and Pacific learners</li>
<li>continuing to improve processes for internal evaluation</li>
<li>seeking professional development support to strengthen assessment and evaluation practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ward 26A Playroom completed an <em>ERO Hospital-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve current practices, the employer and team leader should ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>as identified in ERO's 2012 report, an annual plan is developed to guide continual improvements and provision for children's education</li>
<li>the workload of HPS in sole charge positions is regularly reviewed</li>
<li>budgets and use of government funding are transparent to staff and families.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ward 26A Playroom will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>22 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-hospital-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Hospital-based Education and Care Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

<li>Pou Whakahaere– how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to contribute to children’s learning and promote their wellbeing</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi– how leadership is enacted to contribute to children’s learning and promote their wellbeing</li>
<li>Mātauranga– whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to contribute to children’s learning and promote their wellbeing</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako– how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity, contribute to children’s learning and promote their wellbeing</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness ofarotake– self review and ofwhanaungatanga– partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service responds to children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the methodology for ERO reviews in Hospital-based Education and Care Services.</p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to contribute to children’s learning and promote their wellbeing. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on<a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/"> ERO's website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that contribute to children’s learning and wellbeing and are useful to the service.</p>
