<html><a id="1-background" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. Background</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A Supplementary Review is undertaken at the discretion of a National Manager, Review Services in the Education Review Office (ERO).</p>
<p>A supplementary review evaluates the extent and effectiveness of actions a centre has taken towards addressing issues specified in a previous education review and/or any additional areas identified since that review.</p>
<h3>Terms of Reference</h3>
<p>This supplementary review is based on an evaluation of the performance of the YMCA Queens ParkEarly Learning Centre governing body and management in relation to areas identified in the May 2012 ERO report or issues identified since that review. The terms of reference for this review are to investigate:</p>
<ul><li>governance and leadership within the centre</li>
<li>the use of self review to guide improvements within the centre</li>
<li>the development and implementation of the centre&rsquo;s vision and philosophy to guide how the centre supports children&rsquo;s care and learning</li>
<li>the provision of a curriculum that supports the learning of all children</li>
<li>bicultural practices within the centre.</li>
</ul><a id="2-evaluation-findings" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Evaluation Findings</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The centre was purchased 18 months ago by the YMCA. ERO reviewed the centre shortly after this and found a number of areas where improvements were needed. These are listed in the Terms of Reference above.</p>
<p>Previously, the centre provided care and education for children under the age of two. Now the centre caters for children from birth to five years.</p>
<p>The manager, head teacher and teachers, with help from the YMCA organisation, have made outstanding progress in addressing the recommendations in the May 2012 ERO report.</p>
<p>Children at the centre enjoy interesting, varied and well-planned learning experiences. They play happily with and alongside each other.</p>
<p>ERO observed caring and nurturing interactions between infants and toddlers and their teachers. These young children are relaxed and confident with their teachers.</p>
<p>Teachers know the children very well and work closely with their parents. They often seek parents&rsquo; views and wishes about their children&rsquo;s learning and can show how they respond to these.</p>
<h3>Areas of progress</h3>
<h4><em>Effective governance and leadership</em></h4>
<p>The manager, head teacher and teachers have implemented a detailed action plan to address the recommendations in the 2012 ERO report. This has been a systematic and well-documented process.</p>
<p>The centre has been well supported by the YMCA organisation. This included:</p>
<ul><li>generous funding for professional development for staff and resources for children</li>
<li>providing useful support structures and resources to assist the efficient operation of the centre</li>
<li>close involvement of the local licensee.</li>
</ul><p>The manager and head teacher are effectively managing and leading the centre. This is evident in the way they:</p>
<ul><li>recognise and grow the strengths and leadership skills of teachers</li>
<li>have clarified roles and responsibilities</li>
<li>have developed amongst teachers a shared understanding about effective practice and a strong team culture.</li>
</ul><p>The next steps are to:</p>
<ul><li>further develop long and short-term plans to guide the implementation of the centre&rsquo;s vision and priorities</li>
<li>complete the review of the centre&rsquo;s policies and procedures.</li>
</ul><h4><em>Use of effective self review</em></h4>
<p>The manager, head teacher and teachers have made very pleasing progress in developing their understanding and use of self review. Completed reviews show that these:</p>
<ul><li>are thorough and evaluative</li>
<li>use &lsquo;best practice&rsquo; indicators</li>
<li>use multiple perspectives and sources of evidence.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers can show how past reviews have benefited children. For example, self review has led to improvements in teaching practice and the quality of the programmes that teachers provide for children.</p>
<p>The next steps are to:</p>
<ul><li>extend the existing self-review schedule to ensure that it covers all aspects of centre operations over time</li>
<li>develop guidelines for self review within the centre.</li>
</ul><h4><em>Review of the vision and philosophy</em></h4>
<p>The manager, head teacher and teachers have completed an in-depth review of the centre philosophy. This involved looking closely at what their philosophy should look like in practice. Teachers also sought feedback from parents and others about the philosophy.</p>
<p>As a result of this review, teachers have a shared understanding about the centre&rsquo;s values, goals and desired teaching practices.</p>
<h4><em>Provision of a high quality curriculum for all children</em></h4>
<p>Teachers have carefully reviewed aspects of their curriculum, planning and assessment. As a result, children benefit from a richer curriculum that better meets their needs and interests.</p>
<p>Children enjoy a wide variety of interesting learning experiences within and beyond the centre. This includes, groups of children attending weekly gym classes, riding for the disabled and other trips into the community. Children&rsquo;s interests are the starting point for well-planned and well-resourced group projects.</p>
<p>Teachers think more deeply about each child&rsquo;s learning and what strategies they will use to support this. They often discuss with parents their child&rsquo;s learning and progress. Some teachers have found especially effective ways to ensure all teachers know what each child&rsquo;s learning goal is.</p>
<p>The next step for teachers is to review aspects of their planning and assessment for individual children. This should help them identify best practices within the centre and make these common practices.</p>
<h4><em>Bicultural practices within the centre</em></h4>
<p>Children now learn and play in a centre where M&#257;ori language and culture is valued and visible. They participate with enthusiasm in favourite waiata, legends, and dramatic play and art that have M&#257;ori themes. These things are wisely integrated into all aspects of the programme.</p>
<p>M&#257;ori children&rsquo;s language, culture and identity are valued. They and their families feel comfortable to share their knowledge and experiences.</p>
<h4>Area for further improvement</h4>
<p>ERO recommends that the owners, manager and teachers work together to implement the next steps identified in this report.</p>
<a id="3-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again as part of the regular review cycle.</p>
