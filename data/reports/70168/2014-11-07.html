</table><p>Rakaia Childcare &amp; Preschool Ltd is <em>well placed</em> to improve on current practices. While there are significant areas for development in this report, the centre owner demonstrates the capacity to put appropriate measures in place to address these. The teaching team is relatively new with several changes since the February 2012 ERO review. A new curriculum leader was appointed in 2014. Teachers have been provided with professional support by the centre owner that has resulted in some improvements in practice. ERO has asked the centre to develop a plan showing how the owner and staff intend to address the key next steps outlined in this report.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rakaia Childcare and Preschool also operates under name Blue Goose Preschool. The centre owner is a qualified early childhood education (ECE) teacher. The owner has two centres, this one in Rakaia and another in Dunsandel. The centre has indoor spaces for children aged over two and infants and toddlers, although children regularly spend time together using the whole centre environment. The majority of staff are provisionally registered and qualified early childhood teachers. One staff member is training for an ECE qualification. The small teaching team has had some changes in staff since the 2012 ERO review. The management team includes the owner, centre manager and curriculum leader.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers actively involve themselves with children and engage them in conversations. They regularly praise and encourage children.</p><p>Some improvements in planning, including useful guidelines, are helping teachers focus more on planning for individual children. Teachers have put in place some useful strategies to help inform parents about the programme and contribute to their child’s learning.</p><p>Teachers plan for a range of activities to extend children’s experiences. This includes making good use of the community.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to hear and use te reo Māori and experience aspects of tikanga Māori.</p><p>Teachers support regular contact with the local school. Weekly visits to the local school for older children are helping them become familiar with the school environment and routines before they start school.</p><p>Teachers show that they value the cultures of children and families. This is particularly evident in the work teachers have been doing in supporting Pacific children and their families. Teachers have attended professional learning courses to help them increase their knowledge about Pacific cultures. They have made Pacific cultures more visible for children in the environment and resources. Teachers have encouraged families to share aspects of their culture in the programme.</p><p>As a result of training in strategic planning, the management team now has a better process for future planning. Managers have made good use of training in self review to improve their practices.</p><p>A useful policy framework provides good guidance for staff in relation to centre expectations and systems for health and safety. Managers provide teachers with useful guidelines for planning and self review.</p><p>The centre owner has a well-established system for supporting beginning teachers. A focus by the owner on sharing staff expertise across the centres is providing additional support in planning and assessment.</p><p>Staff leadership skills are actively fostered. In 2014, the centre manager and curriculum leader are being provided with in-depth leadership training.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre managers and ERO agree that key aspects for improvement include:</p><ul>
<li>improving the range of strategies teachers use to extend learning</li>
<li>increasing teachers’ ability to reflect on their teaching practices individually and in centre-wide self review</li>
<li>improving programme planning and assessment, including reviewing the purpose and effectiveness of mat times and making more use of parents’ feedback in assessment</li>
<li>identifying in annual and long term planning the priorities for centre development, especially those relating to teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have identified improving the use of the small indoor space as a priority. ERO recommends that teachers review the indoor environment regarding furniture placement for ease of access to resources and safety.</p><p>Managers have also identified, and ERO agrees, that appraisal could be strengthened to become more effective and useful for teachers.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rakaia Childcare &amp; Preschool Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Rakaia Childcare &amp; Preschool Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
