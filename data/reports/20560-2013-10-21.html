</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Gulf Harbour Preschool is a privately owned centre located on the Whangaparaoa Peninsula, north of Auckland. It is licensed to have up to 30 children between the ages of two and six years of age.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. It continues to provide a high quality programme that integrates <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, with many aspects of the Reggio Emilia philosophy. These approaches help provide children with a pleasing, purposeful environment and opportunities for learning through project work.</p><p>The two centre leaders are passionate about quality education for children. They share responsibility for, and commitment to, managing the preschool. Teachers work collaboratively as a team and are valued for their particular skills, interests and abilities.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are the focus of this centre. They are engaged learners who are guided to make choices and are supported by their teachers. Families and children contribute to the learning programme. Children share leadership opportunities in discussion times and when sharing their learnings from project work.</p><p>Positive and affirming relationships are evident between teachers and children. Teachers work alongside children to encourage and guide their play. They interact respectfully with children and engage in meaningful conversations. Teachers are sensitive and responsive to children’s individual development. They provide a calm ordered environment that allows children time and space to learn.</p><p>Teachers provide a well considered, high quality environment for children that promotes investigation, curiosity and inquiry. The programme allows children to revisit their learning.</p><p>Teachers use te reo and tikanga Māori practices throughout the day. The diversity of cultures and individual needs within the centre are recognised and valued.</p><p>Children’s assessment portfolios and wall displays are celebrations of children’s learning. These contain good information for parents about children’s care and engagement in the programme. Planning and assessment are integral to the programme, which is focussed on following children’s individual interests and leads on to project and research activities.</p><p>Parents express a high level of satisfaction with the education and care provided for their children. Strong links between home and the preschool are fostered. The transition programme into and out of the centre is very supportive for children and their families. Relationships between the preschool and neighbouring schools are strong. Preschool systems for supporting children’s transition to school is an area for the teaching team to further explore through self review.</p><p>Centre leaders promote professionalism and distributed leadership practices. They value relationships based on mutual respect and trust. Appropriate and relevant professional development focuses staff. They continue to explore, develop and foster good practice.</p><p>Teachers enthusiastically commit to professional development and have created a culture where children are honoured and respected.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that a next step to further strengthen the programme is to increase the extent to which New Zealand’s bicultural heritage is included in the centre philosophy and practice.</p><p>ERO's findings also indicate that it would be beneficial to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to develop teaching practices to extend children’s learning through more complex questioning</li>
<li>review the extent to which teachers enable children to lead and direct their learning.</li>
</ul><p>Review and improvement in these areas will help teachers to further support children to be competent, capable self managing learners as documented in <em>Te Whariki</em>, Early Childhood Curriculum and the New Zealand Curriculum.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirement</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Gulf Harbour Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Gulf Harbour Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>21 October 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
