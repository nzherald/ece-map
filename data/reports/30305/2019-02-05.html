</table><p>Education Angels One Palmerston North is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Education Angels One Palmerston North is one of seven Education Angels home-based early childhood education and care networks operating across New Zealand. This is one of two networks located in Palmerston North. It is licensed for 80 children including 80 up to two years of age. The current roll of 55 children includes 11 who identify as Māori.</p><p>The service was purchased by Education Angels organisation in August 2018. It was formally known as Sprouts in-Home Childcare Manawatu 9.</p><p>The owner/managers are responsible for the business aspects of Education Angels organisation. An operations manager has oversight of administration, finance and educator training. Two visiting teachers have responsibility for curriculum and the day-to-day running of the service.</p><p>The December 2016 ERO report identified a number of next steps for improvement. The previous owner had been progressing work in the following areas: governance; assessment for learning; internal evaluation; bicultural practice; appraisal; strategic planning; and establishing systematic assurance practices.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of this service under its new name the Education Angels organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A clear vision sets direction for the service and is aligned to the philosophy that outlines the service’s valued outcomes for children.</p><p>The service has appropriately developed and implemented systems, processes and practices to monitor that its expectations for provision of quality education and care are being met. A focus has been on quality assurance, appraisal and induction processes to support new educators and visiting teachers.</p><p>Children benefit from positive and caring relationships with educators and visiting teachers. They engage in a wide range of learning opportunities within the home, playgroup, music sessions and the wider community. This provides opportunities for them to socialise with other children while in their educators' care.</p><p>Regular visits from visiting teachers support educators to provide for the needs of the children in their care. These visits include a focus on building educators' understanding of <em>Te Whāriki</em> and their capability to work with the early childhood curriculum. Some useful templates have been developed to support them to plan for children’s learning in relation to their interests and stages of development. It is timely to review current assessment, planning and evaluation practices and guidelines to better support educators' knowledge and understanding of what effective practice looks like, including:</p><ul>
<li>deliberate planning to better respond to and extend children’s interests and learning over time</li>
<li>incorporating parents' aspirations and perspectives</li>
<li>responding to children’s culture, language and identity.</li>
</ul><p>Documentation shows how visiting teachers and educators use te reo Māori, waiata and karakia with children. Continuing to implement a culturally responsive, curriculum reflective of the local context remains a priority.</p><p>A recent review of monthly visit reports has strengthened the identification and response to children’s learning and subsequent sharing of this with families. Further information is provided for parents about their child’s day through daily diaries and individual learning journeys. These are an attractive record of children’s engagement in learning and stages of development.</p><p>Careful consideration is given to the placement of children with educators. This is personalised and responsive to the needs of individual children and their families.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are viewed as confident and capable learners and are well supported in home environments that promote their sense of belonging and wellbeing.</p><p>Developing a shared understanding of internal evaluation and using this to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the curriculum in reflecting the philosophy and newly implemented systems and practices is a key next step. This should enable the leadership team to know what is working or not working, who for and why. Findings should then be used to inform decision-making for on-going improvement and future development. Developing a clear and carefully considered strategic plan outlining direction and actions for the organisation, defined by outcomes for children, should support this.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leadership team and ERO agree the next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>continue to strengthen assessment, planning and evaluation practices</li>
<li>further develop and implement a culturally responsive curriculum</li>
<li>develop a strategic plan outlining direction and actions for the organisation</li>
<li>build a shared understanding of internal evaluation and use this to evaluate the impact of newly implemented systems, processes and practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Education Angels One Palmerston North completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Education Angels One Palmerston North will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p>Central Region</p><p>5 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
