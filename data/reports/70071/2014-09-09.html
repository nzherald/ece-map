</table><p>Kindercare Learning Centres (215) is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres (215) is located in Tower Junction. It is one of 11 early childhood education and care centres, in Christchurch, owned and administered by the Kindercare Learning Centres Ltd. The service owners have a strong philosophy, useful policies and procedures and a framework for monitoring health and safety.</p><p>An area manager is working in partnership with the centre director to improve the quality of the programme and practices. The key next steps are to make the philosophy more evident, and strengthen leadership and teaching and learning practices.</p><p>Kindercare Learning Centres (215) is a large and complex operation. Three centres joined together after the 2011 Canterbury earthquakes and merged two licenses in 2012. Children and families come from a wide geographical area, and a diverse range of cultures. Since the merger there have been changes in leadership and teaching staff.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven reviews for the Kindercare Learning Centres Service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers are caring and supportive of children. They follow children’s interests in the daily programme. Teachers plan for and evaluate the impact of resources and activities provided for children to extend their interests. They supervise children and comment on their involvement in activities. Teachers are beginning to place an increased focus on developing bicultural perspectives within the programme. ERO observed teachers in the infant and toddler area working with babies in nurturing and responsive ways.</p><p>Parents are informed about children’s interests and participation in the programme through attractive wall displays, newsletters, portfolios, and journals. Parents have opportunities to attend social and education evenings that help to make connections between home and the centre.</p><p>Children have easy access to a wide range of good quality resources within well-organised environments. Visitors to the centre and visits into the community support the programme offered to children.</p><p>The centre director fosters respectful and inclusive relationships with children, staff and families.</p><p>Kindercare guidelines for self review are used to improve the team’s understanding and use of self review. Teachers are encouraged to reflect on their practices and to contribute to centre self review. Parent surveys are used to gain parent perspectives about the centre operation.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next steps for senior managers and the centre director include:</p><ul>
<li>developing long-term and annual planning to prioritise how they will promote the Kindercare philosophy, vision and goals</li>
<li>developing job descriptions that clearly define the roles and responsibilities of all centre leaders</li>
<li>strengthening the teacher appraisal process</li>
<li>extending planning and evaluation to more effectively provide teachers with the direction that they need to improve children’s learning</li>
<li>increasing parent and child contributions to children’s learning</li>
<li>increasing bicultural perspectives in practices, the learning environment and documentation</li>
<li>reviewing kai (meal) and group routines to ensure that they meet the needs of all children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres (215) completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified an area of non-compliance relating to adult-to-child ratios. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following area.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Ensure that the adult-to-child ratios (minimum) are maintained at all times.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008, Schedule 2.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consults with the Ministry of Education and plans to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><p>The service has provided ERO with an action plan to show how it will address the identified areas for development and the compliance action in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres (215) will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>9 September 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
<li>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</li>
</ul><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
