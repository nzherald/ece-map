</table><p>Avonside Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Avonside Early Childhood Centre is a community-based centre. It provides care and education for children aged two-to-five years old within a mixed-aged group setting. The centre also provides work experience opportunities for secondary school students.</p><p>A board of trustees governs the overall operation of the centre. An operation manager is responsible for the business management of the centre and the senior teacher is responsible for the curriculum. Most staff are experienced and registered early childhood teachers who have been employed by the centre for a number of years.</p><p>In 2015, there were some changes to the leadership and two new teachers were appointed. The teaching team are currently undertaking an in-depth review of the centre’s philosophy to ensure that it reflects the priorities of the learning community.</p><p>The recommendations in the July 2013 ERO report have all been met.</p><p>Leaders and teachers are part of the Linwood Learning Cluster and Wellbeing Community Hub that includes early childhood centres, schools and specialist agencies that are focused on supporting the education and wellbeing of children within their increasingly diverse community.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their parents and whānau are warmly welcomed into an inclusive learning environment. Teachers and leaders foster strong, responsive and respectful relationships across the centre. Children benefit from positive and caring interactions with their teachers and peers.</p><p>Teachers consistently use a range of useful strategies to encourage children to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>initiate and maintain positive relationships with others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be independent and develop self-help skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extend their oral language and conversation skills.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children learn and play in well-considered, attractively presented environments. They are provided with a good range of interesting activities, including creative and physical play, and real life experiences to support their learning and engagement in the programme.</p><p>Teachers use practices that extend children's interests and involve them in making decisions about their learning. Literacy, mathematics and music are well integrated into the programme. Increasing use is being made of digital devices in teaching and learning.</p><p>Teachers actively promote learning partnerships with parents and whānau. They listen carefully to families and make good use of their aspirations for their children. Parents' contribution and involvement in the programme is encouraged and valued. They are well informed about their children’s interests and centre events through a number of informative and useful ways.</p><p>Children's home language, culture and identity is acknowledged and valued. Teachers are focused on integrating a bicultural curriculum in ways that are meaningful for children and respectful of the Māori culture.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have a personalised approach to helping children and families make a positive transition into the centre and to develop a good sense of belonging and wellbeing. They have strong purposeful links to the community that enable them to sensitively support children and families as needed. Teachers also have close working relationships with a number of local schools to support children's transition to school.</p><p>The teaching team work collaboratively, have shared values and use consistent practices when they are working with children. Teachers are reflective and use self-review to inform decision making and to make changes to their practices.</p><p>Leaders make good use of identified individual teacher strengths. They have provided a wide range of targeted external professional learning development (PLD) across the service. This is having a positive impact on building teacher capability and leadership capacity.</p><p>The effective management structure is supporting the efficient operation of the service. There is increasing alignment between the centre's vision, strategic planning, self-review, appraisal and PLD. These links are contributing to sustainable management practices.</p><p>Governance processes have been significantly improved since the 2013 ERO review. There is a good variety of experience and skill within the board. Trustees are kept well informed about key centre priorities and developments.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders agree that the key next steps for the centre are for teachers to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the consistency of children's assessment documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self-review processes, including the evaluation of practices that impact on children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the rigour of appraisal processes to more closely align with the expectations of the Education Council.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Leaders and teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that priority should be given to extending teachers' culturally responsive practices and knowledge of Pacific cultures.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Avonside Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Avonside Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>12 October 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
