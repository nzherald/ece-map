</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bambinos Manukau Early Childhood Centre is a family business situated between Manukau and Manurewa. The centre serves a culturally diverse community. It is licensed for 120 children, including 25 up to the age of two years, and provides full-day and part-time options. This is the centre's first review.</p><p>The Manukau centre is one of three Bambinos services governed by four directors. One director/manager oversees management of the centres. A new manager for the Manukau centre has recently been appointed but at the time of this review had not taken up the role. Four supervisors lead curriculum development and implementation for the five groups of children. The infant programme is in the Kiwi room, toddlers in Pukeko, older toddlers in Tui, and children up to school age in Kereru/Kea.</p><p>The centre's philosophy has a strong emphasis on family and community. Teachers work to ensure the programme is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The philosophy also emphasises respectful relationships, and children are viewed as capable, competent learners.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children demonstrate a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging. Infants and toddlers receive individualised care and attention in a nurturing environment. Toddlers are confident to explore and communicate with a variety of adults. The well planned outdoor environment is used well to extend children's play, further enriching their learning experiences and exploration. A culture of respect is embedded in the programme.</p><p>Older children engage in imaginative and cooperative play for long periods. They confidently share their ideas with teachers and other children. They are familiar with routines and trust teachers to support their play. Teachers are responsive to children’s interests. They skilfully ask questions that encourage children to share their thinking and ideas. Teachers are committed to a Tiriti-based curriculum. They use te reo Māori, and incorporate tikanga and waiata in meaningful ways that allow children to understand and respond.</p><p>Children's languages and cultural identity are valued in the learning programme. Teachers reflect the diverse cultures in centre. An emphasis on building strong partnerships with families and the local community has had a positive impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Children’s strengths, interests and participation in the programme are clearly shown in attractive learning records. Some teachers skilfully identify the learning that happens in the context of children’s play. Whole team professional development has improved programme planning, assessment systems and staff professional practices.</p><p>The introduction of an online tool to strengthen communication enables parents to receive and respond to information shared about their children's involvement in the programme. Supervisors acknowledge that parents' aspirations for their children’s learning could be included in portfolios and planning records. It would also be useful for teachers to refine the way they evaluate group programmes to more consistently focus on improving children's learning outcomes.</p><p>Teachers continually review their processes for ensuring children's smooth transitions into and through the centre, and on to school or other services. They agree that they need to evaluate and improve the 'preparation for school' programme.</p><p>The teaching team is reflective and collaborative. Teachers have worked well to develop shared understandings about good quality teaching practices. Team building has been a focus as the roll has grown and new staff employed. Well-developed internal evaluation systems enable teachers to identify improvements needed, and make positive changes to enhance children’s experiences at the centre. The teaching team is planning to make more effective use of current research and feedback from families to improve centre practices.</p><p>The directors agree that a review of teacher appraisal processes is a priority. They need to develop clear procedures for appraisal and the endorsement of teachers' practising certificates.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers should also review the strategic plan to develop relevant, improvement focused goals. Linking strategic goals with internal evaluation, teacher appraisal and professional development would enable a more connected approach to guide ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The directors and supervisors agree that next steps to build on existing good practices include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening programme planning, assessment and evaluation practices to consistently identify children's interests, dispositions for learning and progress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making children's home language and cultural identity, and their parents' aspirations, more explicit in children's portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving the quality of internal evaluation by deepening evaluative critique of centre practices and outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving resources for older children to provide greater challenge to promote their thinking and increase the complexity of their play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing and refining policies and procedures to ensure they meet current legal requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The directors agree that they could strengthen the current strategic plan to be more meaningful for all stakeholders, and to more effectively guide ongoing improvements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bambinos Manukau Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bambinos Manukau Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>14 November 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
