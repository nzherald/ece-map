</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Junior Junction Lunn Ave provides full day education and care for up to 100 children, including up to 30 aged under two. The centre operates from a spacious, purpose-built facility. It is organised into four rooms to cater for the different age groups. Children have ready access to separate outdoor areas and opportunities to play with mixed ages throughout the day. This is the first ERO review of the service, which opened in 2014.</p><p>The centre is part of the Junior Junction organisation that provides administrative and professional support. The owner delegates the management and leadership of the centre to the centre manager, who is a qualified early childhood teacher. Team leaders have responsibility for care routines and the programme provided for the different rooms. The owner and centre manager have prioritised building a professional team.</p><p>The centre philosophy places importance on nurturing children's individual learning and promoting a strong sense of children seeing themselves as learners. Partnerships with families are valued. The four guiding principles of this philosophy are nurture, protect, empowerment and relationships.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Junior Junction Lunn Ave provides high quality education and care for children. Children of all ages are highly engaged in learning through their play. Teachers skilfully support children to access and plan their own learning through encouraging independent thinking, curiosity and creativity. Children see themselves as explorers and are confident learners. They have ownership of their play and their input is encouraged and valued by teachers.</p><p>Children are well supported to develop their social competencies. They negotiate with their peers, have respectful social skills and play collaboratively. They confidently initiate conversations and ask questions. As a result children are able to successfully interact and support each other's play.</p><p>Teachers provide nurturing care for infants and toddlers and build trusting relationships with them. They competently respond to infants' early attempts at verbalisation and use language to soothe and comfort. Teachers model new words for toddlers and give them time to respond and converse.</p><p>The well-designed curriculum supports children's overall development and learning. It provides them with extensive opportunities to investigate, initiate their own learning and be imaginative and creative. Children have daily opportunities to develop early skills in reading, writing and mathematics through integrated approaches. The high quality preparation for school programme is woven through the entire curriculum.</p><p>Children experience an authentic bicultural curriculum. Te ao Māori is integrated into daily centre practice. Māori children hear and see their language and culture in the programme. Teachers also plan within the programme to recognise and respond to children's diverse cultures.</p><p>Teacher planning and assessment is highly responsive to individual children's strengths and interests. Records show the complexity and deeper levels of children's developing skills and learning. Parent feedback and contribution is documented and acknowledged. These approaches help teachers to provide a comprehensive curriculum that is relevant for children and their families.</p><p>The centre benefits from highly capable leadership and collaborative team work. The centre manager has successfully and quickly built a strong professional culture within a large teaching team. High expectations are set for staff and they are well supported in their professional practice. Teachers have high expectations of themselves in their role of extending children's learning. Team leaders also play a significant role in leading the good practice evident across the centre.</p><p>The centre manager and teachers have a very good understanding of self review. They use it well to promote positive outcomes for children. High quality evaluative practice is evident in the way they consider implications for their teaching and leadership roles.</p><p>Governance and management of the centre is efficient and effective. Operational systems and processes are well aligned. The policy framework and management planning are sound. Robust practices support the health and safety of adults and children in the centre.</p><p>The owner and centre manager want to build on the centre's strengths. They plan to refine appraisal processes to appropriately support staff to continue to deliver high quality care and education for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Junior Junction Lunn Ave completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Junior Junction Lunn Ave will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>29 February 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7">

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p><div>
