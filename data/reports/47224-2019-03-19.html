</table><p>Naturally Nurtured Education Limited is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Naturally Nurtured Education Limited (NNE) is a privately owned and led service, licensed for 50 children, including up to 50 under two. The service caters for children from birth to school age, who are placed in foster care through Oranga Tamariki. Foster parents are the day-to-day carers who provide education and care within their homes. At the time of this ERO review there were 15 children on the roll, with nine who identify as Māori. One of the co-owners who lead the service is a fully qualified and certified teacher and the other is a social worker. They visit homes regularly and provide specialist guidance and support to carers.</p><p>The centre's philosophy emphasises the importance of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>promoting collaborative, respectful and inclusive relationships between teachers, children, carers, guardians, whānau and external agencies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring safe and appropriate learning environments where education and care focuses on the needs and interests of children and their specific circumstances</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reflecting tikanga and te reo Māori practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>incorporating the principles of Te Whāriki, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Naturally Nurtured Education Limited was licensed in 2018. This is the first ERO review of the service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Leaders and teachers prioritise strong, transparent relationships to build positive outcomes for children. They work collaboratively and collegially to support carers to enhance the quality of education and care provided. High expectations, manaakitanga (respect, generosity and care) and the service's vision and values are clearly seen in teaching and learning and the operation of the service.</p><p>Leaders and carers effectively use their depth of knowledge about individual children and their circumstances, to develop highly personalised learning programmes. Priority is given to building children's sense of wellbeing and belonging to better cope with the transitions. Leaders regularly liaise with a wide range of external agencies and individuals to gather multiple perspectives which contribute to enhancing outcomes for children.</p><p>Children's culture, language and identity are valued. Te Whāriki, the Early Childhood Curriculum (principles and strands), and Te Whare Tapu Whā, (four cornerstones of Māori health), are woven together in the service's provision for children's learning. Leaders and carers are respectful of specific teaching and care practices known to enhance outcomes for Māori children.</p><p>In addition to children's learning profiles, leaders and carers record children's individual life journeys. This provides a history for children to revisit and supports them to gain a better sense of themselves. Assessment of learning recognises children's progress over time and effectively informs planning and evaluation to meet their holistic needs and interests.</p><p>Leaders access professional development and relevant research and share the information with carers. Reflective practices are established and modelled to caregivers. Leaders provide high quality guidance to carers that is specific to the wellbeing and learning of children in their care. Specific techniques for promoting positive attachment between children and carers are prioritised. Carers are well supported to respond to the multiple needs of infants and toddlers, including recognition of verbal and non-verbal cues.</p><p>Effective policies and procedures guide the service's practices and operations. There are clear expectations and processes in place. Useful systems support the monitoring of health and safety in carers' homes and the quality of education and care.</p><p>Effective internal evaluation is used well to make improvements and inform professional learning and development decisions. Considerable emphasis is being placed on building further capacity to support Māori and Pacific children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Service owners and ERO agree that the key next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>refine strategic planning to focus more strongly on future directions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to build culturally responsive practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Naturally Nurtured Education Limited completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>19 March 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
